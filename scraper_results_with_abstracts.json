    "abstract": "Background: Emotional eating (EE) is a disordered eating behaviour which may lead to overeating. It is not clear whether EE presents to an equal degree among adults, regardless of their body mass index (BMI) status. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in degree of EE between adults with healthy weight, overweight and obesity. Methods: MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO databases were searched from inception up to January 2022 for studies that reported EE scores from validated questionnaires. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the AXIS tool. Meta\u2010analysis used random effects and standardised mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was investigated usingI2statistics and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 11 studies with 7207 participants were included in the meta\u2010analysis. Degree of EE was greater in adults with a BMI above the healthy range, compared to adults with a healthy BMI (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to0.45;I2= 85%). However, subgroup analysis found that degree of EE was greater only in adults with obesity (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.81;I2= 62%),and there was no difference in degree of EE between adults with overweight and those with a healthy BMI. Conclusions: Degree of EE is greater among adults living with obesity, compared to adults with a healthy BMI, indicating a need for behavioural support to support EE among people living with obesity seeking weight management. Future research should examine the long\u2010term effectiveness of interventions for EE"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People living with overweight or obesity (PLwO) can be stigmatised by healthcare professionals (HCPs). Reducing focus on weight is a proposed strategy to provide less threatening healthcare experiences. Given the lack of research on weight bias within obesity services, this study aimed to explore implicit bias among obesity specialist HCPs and explore views on non-weight focused approaches.METHODS: Obesity specialist HCPs were invited to a webinar, \"An exploration of non-weight focused approaches within bariatric services\", held in October 2021. Implicit weight bias was examined using the BiasProof mobile device test, based on the Implicit Association Test. Poll data was analysed descriptively, and qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis.FINDINGS: 82 of the 113 HCPs who attended the webinar consented to contribute data to the study. Over half (51%) had an implicit weight bias against PLwO. Most (90%) agreed\/strongly agreed that obesity services are too weight focused and that patients should not be weighed at every appointment (86%). Perceived benefits of taking a non-weight focused approach included patient-led care, reducing stigma and supporting patient wellbeing, while perceived barriers included loss of objectivity, inducing risk and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness.INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that half of obesity specialists HCPs in our sample of 82 providers, who are primarily dieticians and psychologists, have an implicit weight bias against PLwO. HCPs feel that a weight-focused approach within services was a barrier to patient care, but that there is a lack of alternative non-weight focused measures. Further research is needed into substitute outcome measures for clinical practice, also seeking the views of PLwO, and into interventions to address implicit weight bias.FUNDING: Johnson & Johnson funded the BiasProof licence and publication open access charge."

Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine factors predictive of 5% weight loss.\n \n Results\n Most centers (n = 9) prescribed an 800- to 1000-kcal diet, but the duration and formulation of diet was variable. Overall, 30.6% (n = 510) of patients achieved 5% weight loss during the LRD. After adjustment for preoperative weight, women had reduced odds (odds ratio [OR], .65; 95% confidence interval [CI], .48\u2013.88; P = .005), while increasing age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.02; P = .043) and having type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.16\u20131.92; P = .002) increased odds of 5% weight loss. A normal consistency food LRD (OR, .64; 95% CI, .42\u2013.98; P = .041) and energy prescription of >1200 kcals\/d (OR, .33; 95% CI, .13\u2013.83; P = .019) reduced odds, while an LRD with a duration of 3 weeks (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.02\u20135.09; P = .044) or greater increased odds of 5% weight loss.\n \n Conclusions\n There is wide variation in how LRDs are delivered in clinical practice, highlighting the need for an evidence-based consensus. Our findings suggest the optimal LRD before bariatric surgery contains 800 to 1200 kcals\/d over a duration of 3 to 4 weeks. Further research is required to determine the optimal formulation of LRD and whether women may require a lower-energy LRD than men."

    "abstract": "Background: Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) is a popular weight loss intervention worldwide, yet few scientific studies have examined variations in preoperative practices globally. This study aimed to capture global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients planned for BMS. Methods: A 41-item questionnaire-based survey was designed and the survey link was freely distributed on social and scientific media platforms, email groups and circulated through personal connections of authors. The survey included eight parts: basic information; criteria for BMS; preoperative nutritional screening; preoperative weight loss; preoperative diets for liver size reduction; preoperative glycemic control; other laboratory investigations and preparations; decision making, education, and consents. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data and graphs were used for representation where applicable. Results: Six hundred thirty-four bariatric healthcare professionals from 76 countries\/regions completed the survey. Of these, n = 310 (48.9%) were from public hospitals, n = 466 (73.5%) were surgeons, and the rest were multidisciplinary professionals. More than half of respondents reported using local society\/association guidelines in their practice (n = 310, 61.6%). The great majority of respondents routinely recommend nutritional screening preoperatively (n = 385, 77.5%), mandatory preoperative diets for liver size reduction (n = 220, 53.1%), routine screening for T2DM (n = 371, 90.7%), and mandate a glycemic control target before BMS in patients with T2DM (n = 203, 55.6%). However, less than half (n = 183, 43.9%) recommend mandatory preoperative weight loss to all patients. Most respondents (n = 296, 77.1%) recommend psychological intervention before surgery for patients diagnosed with psychological conditions. Variations were also identified in laboratory investigations and optimisation; and in the aspects of decision making, education and consent. Conclusions: This survey identified significant global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients seeking primary BMS. Our findings could facilitate future research for the determination of best practice in these areas of variations, and consensus-building to guide clinical practice while we wait for that evidence to emerge."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity, yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy. Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy, recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated. Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive; prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician. Ideally, patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy, through optimising their weight. Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy, excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications; evidence-based recommendations for non-IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain. The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery, with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed, provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission.

    "abstract": "Background:Low energy diets (LEDs)(1000-1200kcal) and very low energy diets (VLEDs) (<800kcal) have been shown to significantly reduce liver size in preparation for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. However, pre-operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre-operative diets within clinical practice. Thus, our study aimed to establish the variation in, and efficacy of, pre-operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at 16 participating UK bariatric centres between 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Patient demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity), diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected. We also collected data about the pre-operative diet regimes, including kcals\/day and duration. A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery. Baseline weight, diabetes status, diet duration and kcals\/day were included in the model.Results:A total of 2,092 patients were included in the analysis. Diets ranged from <800kcal to >1200kcals\/day and lasted one week to \u22655 weeks. The most common diets followed by patients were 800-1000kcals (55.7%) and lasted 2 weeks (71.4%). The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was 5.43kg (95% CI 5.18 to 5.68). Weight on the day of surgery was, on average, 0.79kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (p=0.002), and also less for 4 week (1.90kg, p=0.035) and \u22655 week diets (3.54kg, p=0.001), compared to a 1 week diet. Patients on a <800kcals\/day diet were, on average, 8.86kg lighter than >1200 Kcals\/day diets on the day of surgery (p=0.016). There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of <800kcal\/day diets and LEDs of either 800-1000kcal\/day (p=0.194) or 1000-1200kcal\/day (p=0.212).Conclusions:A range of pre-operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK, reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area. Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre-operative diets were associated with greater pre-operative weight loss. Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre-operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery."

    "date": "Jun 2021",
    "abstract": "Background: Multi-component lifestyle interventions are the first line treatment for obesity. Dietitians are ideally placed healthcare professionals to deliver such interventions. However, only a small proportion of patients with obesity are referred by general practice to dietitians, and the reasons for this are not clear. The present study aimed to explore general practice healthcare professionals\u2019 (GPHCPs) experiences and perceptions of dietitians in the context of obesity management. Methods: A convenience sample of GPHCPs practicing in the UK was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using framework analysis. Results: In total, 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and nine general practitioners). Experiences of referring patients with obesity for dietetic intervention resulted in two main themes: (i) access barriers and (ii) the dietetic consult experience. Three themes emerged from participants\u2019 perceptions of a role for general practice dietitians: (i) utilising dietetic expertise; (ii) access to dietitian; and (iii) time. Participants experienced barriers to accessing dietitians for obesity management and felt that having a dietitian working within their general practice team would help address this. Having a dietitian embedded within their general practice team was perceived to have the potential to alleviate GPHCPs\u2019 clinical time pressures, offer opportunities for upskilling, and may improve patient engagement with obesity management. Conclusions: GPHCPs perceived that embedding a dietitian within their general practice team would be valuable and beneficial for obesity management. Our findings provide support for the funding of general practice dietitian roles in the UK."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multi-component lifestyle interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change are effective for weight management. However, it is not clear whether delivery in a group or one-to-one format influences weight loss efficacy. The present study aimed to systematically review the evidence of the effectiveness of group compared to one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight management.METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and ISRCTN databases were searched from inception up to February 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing group versus one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with a body mass index \u2265 25 kg m-2 . The primary outcome was weight loss (kg) at 12 months and the secondary outcome was attainment of \u22655% weight loss at 12 months. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis used random effects and estimated risk ratios and continuous inverse variance methods. Heterogeneity was investigated using I2 statistics and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials with 2576 participants were included. Group interventions were favoured over one-to-one interventions for weight loss at 12 months (-1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval = -1.3 to -2.6; I2 = 99%). Participants of group interventions were more likely to attain \u22655% weight loss at 12 months relative to one-to-one interventions (relative risk = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.00; I2 = 60%).CONCLUSIONS: Group multi-component lifestyle interventions are superior for weight loss compared to one-to-one interventions with respect to adult weight management. Further research is required to determine whether specific components of group interventions can explain the superiority of weight loss outcomes in group interventions."

    "abstract": "Background Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity. However, without recommended follow-up it has long-term risks. Aim To investigate whether nutritional and weight monitoring in primary care meets current clinical guidance, after patients are discharged from specialist bariatric care. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study in primary care practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data in the UK (1 January 2000 to 17 January 2018). Method Participants were adults who had had bariatric surgery with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 follow-up post-surgery, as this study focused on patients discharged from specialist care (at 2 years post-surgery). Outcomes were the annual proportion of patients from 2 years post-surgery with a record of recommended nutritional screening blood tests, weight measurement, and prescription of nutritional supplements, and the proportions with nutritional deficiencies based on blood tests. Results A total of 3137 participants were included in the study, and median follow-up post-surgery was 5.7 (4.2\u20137.6) years. Between 45% and 59% of these patients had an annual weight measurement. The greatest proportions of patients with a record of annual nutritional blood tests were for tests routinely conducted in primary care, for example, recorded haemoglobin measurement varied between 44.9% (n = 629\/1400) and 61.2% (n = 653\/1067). Annual proportions of blood tests specific to bariatric surgery were low, for example, recorded copper measurement varied between 1.2% (n = 10\/818) and 1.5% (n = 16\/1067) where recommended. Results indicated that the most common deficiency was anaemia. Annual proportions of patients with prescriptions for recommended nutritional supplements were low. Conclusion This study suggests that patients who have bariatric surgery are not receiving the recommended nutritional monitoring after discharge from specialist care. GPs and patients should be supported to engage with follow-up care. Future research should aim to understand the reasons underpinning these findings."

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. Methods: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept\/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. Results: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a0227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. Conclusion: Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes."

This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges.                              Recent Findings                Evidence for tier 2 (community-based lifestyle intervention) and tier 3 (specialist weight management services) is limited, and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier 4 remains uncertain. Treatment access, rigidity in pathways, uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care.                              Summary                More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments, treatment flexibility, addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcomes. Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways. A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care for those who need it."

    "abstract": "Background: Many bariatric surgical centers mandate achieving weight loss targets through medical weight management (MWM) programs before offering bariatric surgery, but the evidence for this is unclear. Objectives: To examine the relationship between weight changes during (1) MWM, and (2) preoperative low-energy-diet (LED), and weight changes at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Setting: Multicenter community- and acute-based MWM services referring to one regional bariatric center, United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients who attended MWM and then underwent a primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure (adjustable gastric banding [LAGB], or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) in a single bariatric center in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015. Data were collected from patient electronic records. Results: Two hundred eight patients were included (LAGB n = 128, RYGB n = 80). Anthropometric data were available for 94.7% and 88.0% of participants at 12 and 24 months, respectively. There was no relationship between weight loss during MWM and after surgery at either 12 or 24 months. Weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB (\u03b2 = .251, P = .006) and less weight loss after RYGB (\u03b2 = \u2212.390, P = .003) at 24 months, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline weight, and LED duration. Conclusions: Weight loss in MWM does not predict greater weight loss outcomes up to 24 months after LAGB or RYGB. Greater weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB and less weight loss after RYGB. Our results suggest that patients should not be denied bariatric surgery because of not achieving weight loss in MWM. Weight loss responses to preoperative LEDs as a predictor of postsurgical weight loss requires further investigation."

Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective intervention resulting in sustained weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. However, the outcomes of BS in older patients are unknown.Methods: A retrospective study utilising the bariatric database from a single UK NHS BS centre. We identified all older patients, aged \u226565 years old at surgery, who had BS between 2003 and 2013 and all were matched to 2 \u2018typical\u2019 aged controls (38 \u2013 53 years old, the age IQR for BS patients at our centre) for surgical procedure, gender, referral body mass index (BMI) and diabetes status. Data were obtained from both local and GP records. Survival was compared between cases and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and the log rank test up to 5-years post-operatively.Results: The mean age (S.D.) for cases (n=41) and controls (n=82) were 67 (2.3) and 46 years (5.1), respectively. Mean BMI was 47 kg\/m2 (7.2), 34% were men and 59% had Type 2 diabetes. There was 0% mortality in both cases and controls at 30-days post-operative. Over 5-years post-operative follow-up; there was 9.8% (n=4) mortality in older adults (9.8%) 1.2% mortality (n=1) in controls (P=0.03). No deaths were due to surgical complication. At 5-years post-operative, BMI reduction in older adults (7.2\u00b16.1 kg\/m2) was significantly less than younger controls (11.6\u00b18.6 kg\/m2) (t(72)=\u22122.218, P=0.030). Meanwhile there was no significant difference in change in HbA1c among patients with Type 2 Diabetes (P=0.516).Conclusion: In older adults, BS was not associated with increased 30-day mortality or surgical-related mortality up to 5 years post-surgery. BS resulted in clinically meaningful BMI reductions in older patients at 5 years post-surgery. However, BMI reductions were significantly greater in younger patients at 5 years post-surgery. The impact of surgery on glycaemic control was similar across older and younger adults with Type 2 diabetes. BS is a valid option of treatment in older patients with obesity, future studies need to examine the impact of surgery on functionality and quality of life in this patient group."

The aim of our study was to explore the effect of indices of deprivation on access to bariatric surgery and its outcomes.Methods: Cross-sectional prospective evaluation in a single centre in England of all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery in 2016. Deprivation was assessed using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) (2015), which ranks areas within England from the most (IMD Decile=1) to least deprived (IMD Decile=10). We extracted lower-layer super output area IMD Deciles according to the patients post code at time of bariatric surgery as well as the 12-month post-surgical weight loss and type of surgery.Results: Of the 183 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, 55% (n=102) lived in areas within the 1-3rd IMD Decile (most deprived areas) (27% (4-6th) and 17% (7-10th) IMD Decile). There was no relationship between the type of bariatric surgery offered and IMD Decile. There was no relationship between IMD Decile tertiles (1-3,4-7, 7-10) and % weight loss at one year either across all bariatric surgical interventions (r2=0.019, P=0.09; r2=0.012, P=0.17) or when analysed according to surgery type.Conclusions: People undergoing bariatric surgery typically lived in more deprived areas which might be anticipated by the correlation between deprivation and obesity as well as the relative levels of deprivation within our catchment area suggesting by this measure that deprivation is not a clear barrier to accessing bariatric surgery, however data was not available on patients who did not undergo surgery and this may reveal potential inequalities with accessing bariatric surgery both at the point of referral from primary care as well as in the transition from Tier 3 to Tier 4 services. Deprivation does not seem to have an effect on weight loss at 1 year post bariatric surgery. This data suggests that the bariatric surgery service is accessible to people across all IMD Deciles within our catchment area.Keywords: Obesity, social deprivation, healthcare inequa"

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, and is closely linked to obesity. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are eating disorders that are common in obesity, and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T2DM.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria; including patients >\u200918 years old, with T2DM, and BED and\/or NES. The reference lists of included studies were also searched. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest.ResultsA total of 10 studies (2 included NES) were included in this systematic review. The number screened for BED and NES were 6527 and 1039 participants, respectively. Point prevalence was 1.2\u20138.0% for BED and 3.8\u20138.4% for NES. Patients with T2DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T2DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA1c.ConclusionsBED and NES are common in adults with T2DM, and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T2DM. However, only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA1c in patients with T2DM. Hence, further well-designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T2DM. Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T2DM."

A total of 45 patients (64.4% women, median [interquartile range] age 49 [45-60] years) were included. The median (interquartile range) weight loss from start of MWM until 12\u2009months post-surgery was 17.9% (13.0%-29.3%). GLP-1RA treatment during MWM resulted in 5.0% (1.9%-7.7%) weight loss. Weight loss during GLP-1RA treatment predicted weight loss from the start of MWM until 12\u2009months post-surgery, but not postoperative weight loss after adjustment. The proportion of weight loss from start of MWM to 12\u2009months post-surgery attributed to GLP-1RA treatment was negatively associated with that attributed to surgery, after adjustment. In conclusion, weight change after GLP-1RA treatment predicted the weight loss achieved by a combination of MWM and bariatric surgery, but not weight loss induced by surgery only. Failure to lose weight after GLP-1RA treatment should not be considered a barrier to undergoing bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Utilising multiple disjoint paths in multiple channels can improve network performance by enabling a node to reroute data along discovered paths seamlessly when link failure is detected. However, depending on a stale\/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover fromthe broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting\/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network."

    "abstract": "Utilising multiple channels can increase the wireless ad hoc network capacity. Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol."

    "abstract": "The route recovery algorithm is a crucial part of an ad hoc routing protocol. Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network."

The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication. Using NS2 simulation, we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV, showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack."

In this paper, we study the performance of both DSR and its flow-state extension routing protocols in the presence of blackhole, grayhole, selfish and flooding attacks. We conclude that the performance of flow-state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks. Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics. Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR.

In this paper, a landscape analysis-based set of features has been analysed using the most renown machine learning approaches to determine the optimal feature set.

Abstract specifications are given as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas which describe the external behaviour of the agents, allowing their temporal behaviour to be compactly modelled. Both abstraction and strategy have been combined in an automated model checking encoding tool Tovrba for rule-based multi-agent systems which allows the system designer to specify information about agents' interaction, behaviour, and execution strategy at different levels of abstraction.

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, context-aware computing has received a growing amount of attention among the researchers in the IoT and ubiquitous computing community. In principle, context-aware computing transforms a physical environment into a smart space by sensing the surrounding environment and interpreting the situation of the user. This process involves three major steps: context acquisition, context modelling, and context-aware reasoning. Among other approaches, ontology-based context modelling and rule-based context reasoning are widely used techniques to enable semantic interoperability and interpreting user situations. However, implementing rich context-aware applications that perform reasoning on resource-bounded mobile devices is quite challenging. In this paper, we present a context-aware systems development framework for smart spaces, which includes a lightweight efficient rule engine and a wide range of user preferences to reduce the number of rules while inferring personalized contexts. This shows rules can be reduced in order to optimize the inference engine execution speed, and ultimately to reduce total execution time and execution cost."

    "abstract": "Many problems in AI and multi-agent systems research are most naturally formulated in terms of the abilities of a coalition of agents. There exist several excellent logical tools for reasoning about coalitional ability. However, coalitional ability can be affected by the availability of resources, and there is no straightforward way of reasoning about resource requirements in logics such as Coalition Logic (CL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL). In this article, we describe a logic for reasoning about coalitional ability under resource constraints. We extend ATL with costs of actions and hence of strategies. We give a complete and sound axiomatization of the resulting logic, Resource-Bounded ATL (RB-ATL) and a model-checking algorithm for it."

    "abstract": "In mobile computing, context-awareness has recently emerged as an effective approach for building adaptive pervasive computing applications. Many of these applications exploit information about the context of use as well as incorporate personalisation mechanisms to achieve intended personalised system behaviour. Context-awareness and personalisation are important in the design of decision support and personal notification systems. However, personalisation of context-aware applications in resource-bounded devices are more challenging than that of the resource-rich desktop applications. In this paper, we enhance our previously developed approach to personalisation of resource-bounded context-aware applications using a derived context-based preference model."

Development of such applications is inherently complex due to these applications adapt to changing contextual information and they often run on resource-bounded devices. Most of the existing context-aware development frameworks are centralized, adopt client\u2013server architecture, and do not consider resource limitations of context-aware devices. This paper presents a systematic framework to modelling and implementation of resource-bounded multi-agent context-aware systems on Android devices. The proposed framework makes use of semantic technologies for context modelling and reasoning about resource-bounded context-aware agents, Android powered smartphones as development platform, a suitable communication model and declarative rule-based programming as a preferred development language."

It refers to the concept that an application understands its context, reason about its current situation, and provide relevant information and\/or services to the users. One of the main challenges of context-aware distributed mobile computing is the dynamic adaptation to changes in the resource-bounded operating environment with user preferences. For example, a depersonalized context-aware application may exhibit behavior that is not anticipated by its user in a given situation. In this paper, we present a personalized preference model for resource-bounded context-aware applications, which provides support for the development and execution of context-aware applications using a declarative language.

    "abstract": "Human-carnivore coexistence (HCC) on agricultural lands affects wildlife and human communities around the world, whereby a lack of HCC is a central concern for conservation and farmer livelihoods alike. For intervention strategies aimed at facilitating HCC to achieve their desired goals it is essential to understand how interventions and their success are perceived by different stakeholders. Using a grounded theory approach, interviews (n=31) were conducted with key stakeholders (commercial livestock farmers, conservationists and protected area managers) involved in HCC scenarios in Limpopo, South Africa. Interviews explored perceptions of successful intervention strategies (aimed at increasing HCC), factors that contribute to perceptions of strategy effectiveness and whether coexistence was a concept that stakeholders considered achievable. The use of grounded theory emphasised the individual nature and previously unexplored facets to HCC experiences. The majority of stakeholders based their measures of success on changes in livestock loss. Concern has been raised over the subjectivity and reliance on recall that this measure involves, potentially reducing its reliability as an indicator of functional effectiveness. However, it was relied on heavily by users of HCC interventions in our study and is therefore likely influential in subsequent behaviour and decision-making regarding the intervention. Nonetheless, perceptions of success were not just shaped by livestock loss but influenced by various social, cultural, economic and political factors emphasising the challenges of defining and achieving HCC goals. Perceptions of coexistence varied; some stakeholders considered farmer-carnivore coexistence to be impossible, but most indicated it was feasible with certain caveats. An important element of inter-stakeholder misunderstanding became apparent, especially regarding the respective perceptions of coexistence and responsibility for its achievement. Without fully understanding these perceptions and their underpinning factors, interventions may be restricted in their capacity to meet the expectations of all interested parties. The study highlights the need to understand and explore the perceptions of all stakeholders when implementing intervention strategies in order to properly define and evaluate the achievement of HCC goals."

    "abstract": "Studies evaluating human\u2013wildlife interactions (HWIs) in a conservation context often include psychometric scales to measure attitudes and tolerance toward wildlife. However, data quality is at risk when such scales are used without appropriate validation or reliability testing, potentially leading to erroneous interpretation or application of findings. We used 2 online databases (ProQuest Psych Info and Web of Science) to identify published HWI studies that included attitude and tolerance. We analyzed these studies to determine the methods used to measure attitudes or tolerance toward predators and other wildlife; determine the proportion of these methods applying psychometric scales; and evaluate the rigor with which the scales were used by examining whether the psychometric properties of validity and reliability were reported. From 2007 to 2017, 114 published studies were identified. Ninety-four (82%) used questionnaires and many of these (53 [56%]) utilized a psychometric scale. Most scales (39 [74%]) had at least 1 test of reliability reported, but reliance on a single test was notable, contrary to recommended practice. Fewer studies (35 [66%]) reported a test of validity, but this was primarily restricted to structural validity rather than more comprehensive testing. Encouragingly, HWI investigators increasingly utilized the necessary psychometric tools for designing and analyzing questionnaire data, but failure to assess the validity or reliability of psychometric scales used in over one-third of published HWI attitude research warrants attention. We advocate incorporation of more robust application of psychometric scales to advance understanding of stakeholder attitudes as they relate to HWI."

    "abstract": "A matter of prideWhy are lions and the groups they live in a good focus of research for a social psychologist?Hands up, who hasn\u2019t been told to go to a conference to \u2018network\u2019 at some point in their academic career. Getting yourself connected into influential social networks can pay dividends both professionally and personally.In 2013 I took a leap, changed direction, and forged a research career as a social psychologist in lion conservation. Excited by an opportunity I\u2019d been given in Zambia and Zimbabwe to do exactly that, I packed my bags. However, I was warned that there were obstacles to my acceptance amongst fellow lion conservationists. I had the wrong PhD. Mine was in psychology. Worse, it was in social psychology! I was urged to enrol for another PhD in wildlife conservation or something \u2018biological\u2019 to ingratiate myself into the influential network of movers and shakers within the lion conservation world. My social science background was irrelevant. How rude. How ironic.Thankfully, wildlife conservation now focuses on working with local communities to develop initiatives that ensure those who live with the risks of protecting a species also receive benefits from doing so. Having unfenced lions living as your neighbour is not on most people\u2019s wish-lists. We\u2019re developing educational and social programmes that enhance local communities\u2019 access to employment and sustainable income revenues, reducing the need to depend on natural resources to forge a living. These include conservation education, where feasible solutions to mitigating conflict with lions are developed and implemented, without loss to people and an increasingly diminishing lion population.Here the application of psychology seems obvious. But what about the lions themselves? Well, lions live in groups. Social psychologists know a thing or two about groups.Social network analysis (SNA) has a long history within the social sciences. SNA defines a plethora of methods that share a basic premise: social connectedness with others matters. The more networked in you are, communicating with others, the better your access and influence over information. You can see why the social sciences have embraced SNA to explore relationships of communication and power across a variety of domains.Within the field of animal behaviour, researchers such as Jens Krause have realised the utility of SNA to examine social cohesion and hierarchies amongst non-human animals. If we think of groups as powerful social networks, and assume the players within them are not equal, this might hold the key to understanding how some animal societies function \u2013 which might prove crucial for their effective conservation.Lion prides describe adult females and their cubs. Males can take over a pride and hold tenure for two to three years (sometimes longer), but will eventually be overthrown by fitter males seeking the opportunity to breed and enjoy the benefits of group living including cooperation in nurturing young, hunting and territorial defence. A lion\u2019s chance of success in the wild is improved by pride living. So, to protect lions, we should focus on pride structure and function to maximise their chances.Considering conservationPrides have tended to be taken for granted in the research literature. They exist. There has been little focus on how they exist, how they are sustained, and the roles of the lions within them. Andrew Sih and colleagues describe \u2018keystone\u2019 individuals in SNA; the \u2018social glue\u2019 of a group because of their tight connections with all others within the networks. In its simplest form: Individuals A and B might not be friends with each other, but they are connected through a relationship they both have with C. That makes C key to holding the group together.I\u2019ve been lucky enough to spend time with lion prides and study their behaviour to examine their structure and function. Each pride has an adult female \u2018keystone\u2019 member who \u2018glues\u2019 the pride together. She holds the most social connections, is the best networked individual, and the most socially influential. She dictates the pride\u2019s movements. Identifying and protecting these keystones is crucial if we are to maintain the integrity of wild prides. Removal of the keystone can lead to the break-up of the group if no other lion steps up to the plate. If we consider that key threats to lions include persecution and disease, keystones can be prime targets. Efforts to restore lions include the translocation of lions across areas, and the reintroduction of lions to the wild. These efforts must identify and understand the structure of prides to ensure crucial social networks are protected in that process.As psychologists know, social networks matter. Including psychology into wildlife conservation networks might prove key to protecting this diverse field."

    "abstract": "The wild population of the African lion Panthera leo continues to decline, requiring alternate conservation programs to be considered. One such program is ex situ reintroduction. Prior to release, long-term monitoring and assessment of behavior is required to determine whether prides and coalitions behave naturally and are sufficiently adapted to a wild environment. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to provide insight into how the pride as a whole and individuals within it, function. Our study was conducted upon 2 captive-origin prides who are part of an ex situ reintroduction program, and 1 wild pride of African lion. Social interactions were collected at all occurrence for each pride and categorized into greet, social grooming, play, and aggression. Betweenness centrality showed that offspring in each pride were central to the play network, whereas degree indicated that adults received (indegree) the greatest number of overall social interactions, and the adult males of each pride were least likely to initiate (outdegree) any interactions. Through the assessment of individual centrality and degree values, a social keystone adult female was identified for each pride. Social network results indicated that the 2 captive-origin prides had formed cohesive social units and possessed relationships and behaviors comparable with the wild pride for the studied behaviors. This study provided the first SNA comparison between captive-bred origin and a wild pride of lions, providing valuable information on individual and pride sociality, critical for determining the success of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program."

We conducted the first study to compare activity budgets of prides of captive-origin African lions (Panthera leo) to a wild pride investigated under the same methodologies. Behavioural data were collected via direct observations of individual lions. The vegetation type in which each pride was located was recorded at the beginning and end of each observation session. Behaviours were analysed via linear mixed models, using restricted maximum-likelihood analysis. Age, sex, origin, time observed and vegetation type were fitted as fixed factors to assess the main effects of significant interactions, while average temperature was fitted as a covariate. Resting and alert behaviours were found to vary at sex and age levels, with expected peaks and lows coinciding with observation session times. Captive-origin prides showed a decrease in resting and increase in alert and movement behaviours post 1700 hours, while this behavioural change was not observed for the wild prides. Males of the wild prides were observed to rest more than captive-origin counterparts, while this variation was not observed for females across origins. Vegetation was found to influence behaviour, with cubs being more alert and active in riverbed vegetation, and adults and sub-adults in shrubland. Overall, all prides were observed to exhibit behaviours at natural levels. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the daily activity of lions critical to the pre-release evaluation of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program."

Elephant presence was confirmed up to 8 km from the boundary of the protected core habitat, focussed in: (1) an unfenced zone of the national park, (2) along a road leading from the national park to the Dambwa Forest to the north and (3) along two rivers located to the west (Sinde River) and east (Maramba River) of the core area.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe apply social psychology to wildlife conservation, using psychological principles to develop and assess a human-wildlife conflict mitigation programme in rural Zimbabwe.  It examines the effectiveness of an intervention in redressing attitudes and behaviours to mitigate night-time conflict between rural communities and wild lions, reducing livestock losses to lions and retaliation killings of lions. Sixteen farms based in the Matetsi Conservancy, Zimbabwe, in human-wildlife conflict areas took part.MethodsFlashing lights were installed on their livestock kraals, matched with 16 \u2018hotspot\u2019 homesteads without lights.  Numbers of attacks before and after the intervention were recorded.  Camera-traps were positioned around each kraal to monitor lion activity.  A conservation education programme was delivered to 67 children living in the area.  Attitudes before and after the intervention were recorded using the Attitudes to Conservation and the Environment (ACE) questionnaire.  The ACE comprises 20 items to measure sub-Saharan African children\u2019s attitudes to their environment and to problem animals.  Participants rated items from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  Behaviours monitored through self-report.  Incidences of lion attacks on livestock recorded using diaries kept by farmers before and after the intervention.FindingsIncidences on livestock significantly reduced in lit farms but unchanged on unlit. Attitudes to lions were 3.7 before, 4.0 immediately afterwards and 4.1, 3 months later with the difference between pre and delayed post approaching significance (p=.086). Self-reported behaviours noted improved husbandry practices.DiscussionWe conclude a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating social psychology is vital to address the human-side of wildlife conservation."

An exploration of behavioral correlations between sociality and behavior of African lions (Panthera leo) was undertaken to examine if this approach is better able to reveal important aspects of lion behavior not easily discernible by looking at these behaviors separately. Resting behavior and received play interactions were correlated in 2 captive-origin prides and one wild pride, attributable to the involvement of cubs and sub-adults. Direct and exploratory movement was negatively correlated with groom centrality in 2 of the 3 prides, due to adults engaging in high levels of both of these activities. Exploration of these behavioral correlations highlighted the differences between age-groups in activity and sociality, facilitating the understanding of the complex behavior and interactions of lions. In addition, the finding of similar behavioral correlations between captive-origin and the wild prides provides confidence in the suitability if captive-origin candidates for ex-situ release. This is imperative to ensure the success of sub-groups and prides under an ex-situ reintroduction program."

We conducted the first exploration into the personality of a captive-origin pride of African lions (Panthera leo), assessing behavioural variations and consistencies in daily activity, social and hunting behaviour, and boldness. Data were collected via direct observations, while a species-specific protocol for testing boldness, using playbacks, was developed. Differences in sex, age and session time for the activity budget were evaluated using Pearson correlations and repeated-measures ANOVA, while social interactions were analysed using social network analysis. Spearman\u2019s correlations were conducted to assess for associations between boldness scores, activity and sociality. The two boldness tests provided a range of scores per lion, indicating that the test was effective. Correlations and variations in individual behaviour indicated that adults and sub-adults have specific roles within pride behaviour. Correlations between boldness and activity and social behaviours provided information on the role of individuals, allowing investigation into the behaviour of a dominant and a social keystone. Our study indicates that evaluating various aspects of behaviour in conjunction with boldness has the potential to assist the pre-release assessment of a pride within an ex situ reintroduction program.The final publication is available at Springer via http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10164-016-0473-9"

In response to the rapid decline of wild African lion (Panthera leo) populations, an array of conservational strategies have been adopted. Ex situ reintroduction of the African lion requires the construction of socially cohesive pride structures prior to wild release. This pilot study adopted a social network theory approach to quantitatively assess a captive pride's social structure and the relationships between individuals within them. Group composition (who is present in a group) and social interaction data (social licking, greeting, play) was observed and recorded to assess social cohesion within a released semi-wild pride. UCINET and SOCPROG software was utilised to represent and analyse these social networks. Results indicate that the pride is socially cohesive, does not exhibit random associations, and the role of socially influential keystone individuals is important for maintaining social bondedness within a lion pride. These results are potentially informative for the structure of lion prides, in captivity and in the wild, and could have implications for captive and wild-founder reintroductions."

    "abstract": "The persistence of traditional monarchies in modern societies, which are otherwise characterized by democratic and egalitarian values, remains a paradox in the social sciences. In part this is attributable to the lack of psychological investigation into the relationship between subject and sovereign, and in particular the ways in which the political and social values of the citizenry shape understandings of a hereditary monarch's right to represent a national community. Adopting the qualitative analysis methods of discursive psychology and grounded theory, the current study examines vernacular accounts of nationhood and monarchy in England in both formalized conversational interviews (n = 60) and impromptu street interviews (n = 56). Focusing on accounts of Prince Charles's recent proposal to change the role of the monarch, from \u201cDefender of the (Christian) Faith\u201d to \u201cDefender of Faiths,\u201d those in favor treated it as a positive step towards reflecting a diverse (religious) community, bringing the monarchy into line with current concerns of pluralism and upholding values of personal choice and individual rights. Participants who rejected the proposed change in title construed it as antithetical to these values in terms of reflecting personal stake and interest, an abuse of power, or an imposition on other faiths. In all accounts, the prime concern was in safeguarding the political and social values of the citizenry. In conclusion it is argued that the study of subjects' relationship to the monarch, its function and legitimacy, can provide an opportunity to examine how values can characterize a national community and facilitate national diversity."

    "abstract": "Although the study of national identity in social psychology has examined the various ways in which the national group is \u2018imagined\u2019, little attention has been paid to the many collective national commemorations, celebrations and rituals of state assumed to unite the nation. This is surprising given the number of celebrations and commemorations which fill the calendars of modern nations throughout the world and which are assumed by social scientists to play some part in the reproduction of the national community. Taking the British Royal Golden Jubilee celebrations of 2002, the present study examines how understandings of Anglo-British national identity are manifest in conversational interviews during and after these events. In line with previous examinations of Anglo-Britishness, our respondents typically resisted imagining the national community as a homogenous whole and distanced themselves from depictions of the Jubilee as a nationalistic event. Support for the Jubilee was contingent upon the event being apolitical and inclusive. We suggest that such collective national events could potentially facilitate ways of imagining the national community in terms of diversity and inclusivity rather than homogeneity and exclusivity."

    "abstract": "Within social psychology, studies of the nation have typically been understood in terms of national identity. Criticisms have been made of the tendency to conflate \u2018being\u2019 a member of a national category with psychological attachment to the group and its members. Furthermore, ethnomethodologically informed approaches have argued that little has been said about when and how social actors frame matters as one of national identity. Taking the example of national football support, this study considers the circumstances under which football may be cast as a matter of national identity, and when such ascriptions are resisted. Interviews were conducted with participants born and resident in England and Scotland, whereas in Scotland national football support is treated as a matter of national identity for Scottish and English people, in England it is separated from a collective sense of English identity. Adopting a discursive analytic stance, this study examines the internal and external attribution of national stereotypes and considers their role in managing issues of social causality, justification of in-group behaviour, and the differentiation of national groups."

Instead, this commentary aims to situate both papers within a broader frame of contemporary, primarily British social psychology, to ponder the circumstances that gave rise to them and their implications for social psychologists, discursive and non-discursive, alike. We have organized this commentary into two parts. The first part considers two simple questions. First, why does Corcoran critique DPEC for failing to do things that other discursive approaches provide for? And, second, why does Corcoran take DPEC research to task for having too little potential for or made too little contribution to improving the lives and subjectivities of people in general? These two questions are not unrelated, but for clarity's sake we will try to answer them separately. The second part of this commentary will consider the influence of discursive psychology on social psychology more generally."

    "abstract": "Researchers have argued that, depending on the framing of the Northern Ireland conflict, each group could either be a minority or a majority relative to the other. This complicates macrosocial explanations of the conflict which make specific predictions on the basis of minority or majority positions. The present paper argues that this conundrum may have arisen from the inherent variability in microidentity processes that do not fit easily with macroexplanations. In this paper the rhetoric of relative group position is analysed in political speeches delivered by leading members of an influential Protestant institution in Northern Ireland. It is apparent that minority and majority claims are not fixed but are flexibly used to achieve local rhetorical goals. Furthermore, the speeches differ before and after the Good Friday Agreement, with a reactionary \u201chegemonic\u201d Unionist position giving way to a \u201cmajority-rights power sharing\u201d argument and a \u201cpseudo-minority\u201d status giving way to a \u201cdisempowered minority\u201d argument. These results suggest a view of the Northern Ireland conflict as a struggle for \u201csymbolic power,\u201d i.e., the ability to flexibly define the intergroup situation to the ingroup's advantage."

Interview data collected around the time of the Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup tournaments fail to substantiate the presumption that support for the England football team maps onto claims to patriotic sentiment in any straightforward way. People with far-right political affiliations did generally use national football support to symbolise a general pride in English national identity. However, other people either claimed not to support the England national team precisely because of its associations with nationalism, or else bracketed the domain of football support from more general connotations of English patriotism."

    "abstract": "At the time of the devolution settlement in the UK, there was widespread concern that the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales would prompt a rise in English identity at the expense of British identity and, in turn, threaten polyethnic constructions of citizenship. Such presumptions typically rested on reified understandings of the category labels British and English, and conflated the construct of national identity with the constructs of territorial belonging, social inclusion and citizenship. Post-devolution survey data do not currently reveal a decline in British identity in England. Measures of attachment to Englishness vary as a function of ethnic origin of respondent, but also as a function of question wording. A qualitative interview study of young adult Pakistani-origin Muslims in Greater Manchester, north-west England, illustrates how Englishness may be understood to pertain variously to an exclusive cultural or racial category, or to an inclusive territorial entity or community of political interest. Ethnic constructions of English identity need not imply exclusive understandings of citizenship, but their meaning depends crucially on the ways in which nationality and identity are in turn understood in relation to matters of polity and civil society. Conversely, inclusive understandings of national identity do not guarantee the existence of effective ethnic integration or substantive ethnic equality."

In Scotland, spontaneous accounts of Empire were typically formulated in conjunction with nationalist moral meta-narratives. Respondents variously inferred heroic national character from Scotland's role in Empire, or cast Scottish history as an enduring struggle between progressive forces of nationalism and atavistic forces of Anglo-British colonialism. The construct of Britishness was often seen to derive from, and to be synonymous with, the history of Empire. In England, the Empire story tended to be framed within anti-nationalist meta-narratives. Imperialism was generally understood to represent a product of excessive nationalism, and tales of Empire were used to draw exemplary moral lessons concerning the deficiencies of Anglo-British national character and of the catastrophic consequences of the pursuit of national self-interest more generally. The existence of Britain, and the construct of Britishness, were generally understood to both predate and postdate the history of Empire."

In this paper, we argue that existing perspectives might usefully be extended to incorporate three additional considerations. First, that social actors may, on some occasions, act to defend not only themselves, but also others from charges of prejudice. Second, that over the course of any social encounter, interactants may take joint responsibility for policing conversation and for correcting and suppressing the articulation of prejudiced talk. Third, that a focus on the dialogic character of conversation affords an appreciation of the ways in which the status of any particular utterance, action or event as \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018prejudiced\u2019 may constitute a social accomplishment. Finally, we note the logical corollary of these observations \u2013 that in everyday life, the occurrence of \u2018racist discourse\u2019 is likely to represent a collaborative accomplishment, the responsibility for which is shared jointly between the person of the speaker and those other co-present individuals who occasion, reinforce or simply fail to suppress it."

In this article we examine the role of interviewer self-disclosure using data drawn from three projects involving interviews with young people. We consider how an interviewer's attempts to \u2018do similarity\u2019 may be interpreted variously as displays of similarity or, ironically, as indicators of difference by the participant, and map the implications that this may have for subsequent interview dialogue.

Respondents in Scotland used island imagery to distinguish their political commitment to British citizenship from questions relating to their subjective identity. Respondents in England used island imagery to distinguish the United Kingdom as a distinctive political entity whilst avoiding allusions to a common or distinctive identity or character on the part of the citizenry. People who had moved from England to Scotland used island imagery to manage the delicate task of negotiating rights to social inclusion in Scottish civil society whilst displaying recognition of the indigenous population's claims to distinctive national culture and identity."

    "abstract": "Adopting a discursive psychological approach, this article considers how identity ascription, warranted through rhetorically loaded descriptions of events, objects, places, and people, plays a fundamental role in locating blame for BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) within British House of Commons debates. The parliamentary debates at the 'peak' of the BSE crisis occurred between 20 and 25 March 1996. Within this time span the European Union ban upon the import and export of British beef was imposed. Whilst many theorists have noted that the introduction of the EU ban led to a change in emphasis within media reports, from health and science to national identity, there has been no work that considers how or why this was accomplished in the political debates themselves. At the heart of the parliamentary debates about BSE lies the question of blame. Arguments concerning whose fault the BSE crisis was and the legitimacy of particular kinds of information and action were highly contentious issues during 1996. It is argued that this attribution and avoidance of blame is linked to the construction and invocation of scientific and national identities within political debates."

    "cu_author": "Jackie Abell",
    "date": "1 Sept 2001",
    "abstract": "We examine critically the two traditions of work that have informed discursive approaches to identity: social constructionism and conversation analysis. Within both strands, identity is theorized as a flexible phenomenon that is situated in conversations. But although constructionists locate identity within the social, such work remains at a theoretical and rather abstract level and often fails to interrogate the discursive practices through which identity is constituted. Conversely, this attention to the occasioning of identity in everyday talk is precisely the focus of the second, conversation analytic strand of work. Whereas constructionists attend to the wider cultural positioning of identities, conversation analysts resist commenting upon the social significance of what is constructed in interaction. Conversation analysis is therefore limited by its restricted notion of culture in the study of the situated social self. Despite the apparent conflict between these approaches, we suggest that a synthesis of the two provides a comprehensive framework for analysing identity. Drawing upon the BBC Panorama interview between Martin Bashir and Princess Diana, we explore how culturally situated identities are located in this conversational context. We conclude that analysts must not only attend to the micro-level organization of identities but also engage in a wider understanding of the cultural framework within which they are located."

    "abstract": "The focus of this article is the conversational management of blaming and accountability. In particular, we explore how involved speakers routinely allocate and avoid blame in everyday talk. In considering such a problematic notion of social interaction, we analyse the BBC interview between Princess Diana and Martin Bashir that was aired on British national television on 20 November 1995. In the analysis, we consider how different discursive strategies are employed by speakers in ways that work up credible and authentic accounts. More specifically, we argue that Diana attributes blame to external `others' within a negotiated context of routine description of past events. Categories such as `the media', `the royal household' and `Charles' are constructed and made relevant throughout the interview and the analytic interest is what is accomplished rhetorically for both Diana and Bashir. Of further interest is the overall script design of the interview and how devices such as script formulation, stake management, footing shifts and progressive narrative function in the negotiation of blame. We conclude that `doing blaming' is attended to and managed locally by participants in conversation and this `doing' can be accomplished in a number of ways."

    "abstract": "This study explores the context dependence of national stereotypes. Scottish subjects stereotyped their own national group in three between-subject conditions: after rating the English, after rating the Greeks, and in isolation (i.e. without explicit reference to any other category). Following the logic of self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher & Wetherell, 1987; Turner, Oakes, Haslam & McGarty, 1994), we predicted that the Scottish self-stereotype would depend on the frame of reference created by the experimental manipulations. Further we predicted that changes in the definition of this stereotype would be dimension specific. In other words, stereotype variation was predicted to be contingent upon the relevance of the dimension of judgment for capturing the differences between the Scottish and the category constituting the frame of reference. These predictions were confirmed. As these data were obtained in a context where quite specific predictions about the nature and form of stereotype variation were possible, these data confirm and extend Haslam, Turner, Oakes, McGarty & Hayes' (1992) analysis of the context dependence of stereotypes."

    "abstract": "BackgroundBirthweight centiles beyond the traditional thresholds for small or large babies are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes but there is a paucity of data about the relationship between birthweight centiles and childhood development among children born from 37 weeks of gestation. This study aims to establish the association between birthweight centiles across the whole distribution and early childhood development among children born from 37 weeks of gestation.Methods and findingsThis is a population-based cohort study of 686,284 singleton infants born from 37 weeks of gestation. The cohort was generated by linking pregnancy and delivery data from the Scottish Morbidity Records (2003 to 2015) and the child developmental assessment at age 2 to 3.5 years. The main outcomes were child\u2019s fine motor, gross motor, communication, and social developmental concerns measured with the Ages and Stages Questionnaires\u20143 (ASQ-3) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social & Emotional\u20142 (ASQ:SE-2), and for asubset of children with additional specialist tools such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) if the ASQ3\/SE indicate these are necessary. The ASQ score foreach domain was categorised as \u201cconcern\u201d and \u201cno concern.\u201dWe used multivariate cubic regression splines to model the associations between birthweight centiles and early childhood developmental concerns. We used multivariate Poissonregression models, with cluster robust errors, to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of developmental concerns below and above the established thresholds. We adjusted for maternal age, early pregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, year of delivery, gestational age at delivery, smoking history, substance misuse in pregnancy, alcohol intake, ethnicity, residential area deprivation index, maternal clinical conditions in pregnancy (such as diabetes and pre-eclampsia), induction of labour, and child\u2019s sex.Babies born from 37 weeks of gestation with birthweight below the 25th centile, compared to those between the 25th and 74th centile, were at higher risk of developmental concerns. Those born between the 10th and 24th centile had an RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.12, p < 0.001), between the 3rd and 9th centile had an RR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.25, p < 0.001), and <3rd centile had an RR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.24 to 1.50, p < 0.001). There was no substantial increase in the risk of early childhood developmental concerns for larger birthweight categories of 75th to 89th (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.05; p = 0.56), 90th to 96th (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05; p = 0.86), and \u226597th centiles (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.12; p = 0.27), referent to birthweight between 25th and 74th centile.The percentage of developmental concerns attributable to birthweight between the 10th and 24th centile was more than that of birthweight <3rd centile (p = 0.023) because this group includes more of the population. Approximately 2.50% (95% CI: 1.26 to 3.61) of social skills concerns and 3.00% (95% CI: 1.33 to 4.67) of fine motor developmental concerns were attributable to birthweight between the 10th and 24th centile compared to 0.90% (95% CI: 0.48 to 1.26) and 2.30% (95% CI: 1.73 to 2.67) respectively for birthweight <3rd centile. We acknowledge the limitation of ASQ as a screening tool, the subjective nature of developmental assessments (particularly for speech) among young children, and inability to control for early childhood illness and upbringing factors may have an impact on our findings.ConclusionsWe observed that from 37 weeks of gestation birthweight below the 25th centile was associated with child developmental concerns, with an association apparent at higher centiles above the conventional threshold defining small for gestational age (SGA, 3rd or 10th centile). Mild to moderate SGA is an unrecognised potentially important contributor to the prevalence of developmental concerns. Closer surveillance, appropriate parental counselling, and increased support during childhood may reduce the risks associated with lower birthweight centiles."

We report the burden of maternal, foetal and neonatal complications and quality and outcomes of care during the first year.Methods: Data were analysed from 76,563 women who were admitted for delivery or on account of complications within 42 days of delivery or termination of pregnancy from September 2019 to August 2020 across the 54 hospitals included in the Maternal and Perinatal Database for Quality, Equity and Dignity programme.Findings: Participating hospitals reported 69,055 live births, 4,498 stillbirths and 1,090 early neonatal deaths. 44,614 women (58\u00b73%) had at least one pregnancy complication, out of which 6,618 women (8\u00b76%) met our criteria for potentially life-threatening complications, and 940 women (1\u00b72%) died. Leading causes of maternal death were eclampsia (n = 187,20\u00b76%), postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (n = 103,11\u00b74%), and sepsis (n = 99,10\u00b78%). Antepartum hypoxia (n = 1455,31\u00b71%) and acute intrapartum events (n = 913,19\u00b76%) were the leading causes of perinatal death. Predictors of maternal and perinatal death were similar: low maternal education, lack of antenatal care, referral from other facility, previous caesarean section, latent-phase labour admission, operative vaginal birth, non-use of a labour monitoring tool, no labour companion, and non-use of uterotonic for PPH prevention.Interpretation: This nationwide programme for routine data aggregation shows that maternal and perinatal mortality reduction strategies in Nigeria require a multisectoral approach. Several lives could be saved in the short term by addressing key predictors of death, including gaps in the coverage of internationally recommended interventions such as companionship in labour and use of labour monitoring tool.Funding: This work was funded by MSD for Mothers; and UNDP\/UNFPA\/ UNICEF\/WHO\/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), a co-sponsored programme executed by the World Health Organization (WHO)."

All randomized or non-randomized studies reporting AEDF or REDF prevalence based on Doppler assessment of umbilical arterial flow > 20\u00a0weeks\u2019 gestation were eligible. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data on primary (AEDF and REDF) and secondary (fetal, perinatal, and neonatal mortality, caesarean section) outcomes, with results presented descriptively. Results: A total of 42 studies (18,282 women) were included. Thirty-six studies reported zero AEDF or REDF cases. However, 55 AEDF or REDF cases were identified from just six studies (prevalence 0.08% to 2.13%). Four of these studies were in unselected-risk women and five were conducted in high-income countries. There was limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries. Conclusions: Evidence from largely observational studies in higher-income countries suggests that AEDF and REDF are rare among low- and unselected-risk pregnant women. There are insufficient data from lower-income countries and further research is required."

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the prevalence of life-threatening complications related to pregnancies with abortive outcome and the associated health service events and performance in Nigerian public tertiary hospitals. Design: Secondary analysis of a nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting: Forty-two tertiary hospitals. Population: Women admitted for pregnancy-related complications. Methods: All cases of severe maternal outcomes (SMO: maternal near-miss or death) due to abortive pregnancy complications (defined as spontaneous or induced abortion, and ectopic pregnancy) were prospectively identified over 1\u00a0year using uniform identification criteria. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of SMO, mortality index (% maternal death\/SMO), case fatality rate, time until death after admission, and health service performance. Results: Of 5779 women admitted with abortive pregnancy complications, 444 (7.9%) experienced an SMO: 366 maternal near-misses and 78 maternal deaths. Intra-hospital maternal mortality ratio from complicated abortive pregnancy outcome was 85\/100\u00a0000 live births. Case fatality rate was worst for abortion-related infections (19.1%). A quarter of maternal deaths occurred on the same day of admission; however, the peak time of occurrence of death was 3\u20137\u00a0days of admission. Women experiencing cardiovascular, renal or coagulation organ dysfunction were less likely to survive. Higher level of maternal education and closer residence to a health facility improved chance of maternal survival. Conclusions: Abortive outcome remains a major contributor to SMO in Nigeria. Although early hospital presentation by women is critical to surviving abortive pregnancy complications, improved, appropriate, and timely management is essential to enhance maternal survival. Tweetable abstract: 78 maternal deaths and 366 near-misses occurred from abortions and ectopic pregnancies in 42 Nigerian referral hospitals in 1\u00a0year."

    "date": "2 Dec 2019",
    "abstract": "Contraceptive use in Nigeria has remained low at less than 15% for over two decades. Although husbands\u2019 opposition is acknowledged as one of the factors impeding women\u2019s contraceptive use, little is known about how wives negotiate when their husbands oppose family planning. We addressed this research gap by conducting thematic analyses of qualitative data from 30 interviews of married couples. We employed thematic analysis to identify relevant themes from the transcribed data. The findings clearly demonstrate attitudes highlighting an imbalance in power relations and contraceptive decision-making within marital relationships. By initially complying with the husband\u2019s wish as a \u2018sign of honour\u2019, and then making further attempts at convincing him about family planning use, a woman can achieve her contraceptive target, or through the involvement of a third party. Wives are less empowered to overtly use contraceptives when their husbands oppose family planning. However, there are accepted justifications for covert use. The findings underscore the need to strengthen family planning interventions to enable behavioural change among Nigerian men, promote gender and reproductive health rights, and empower women with better negotiation skills."

    "abstract": "Background: Fertility rates remain persistently high in Nigeria, with little difference across socioeconomic groups. While the desire for large family size is culturally rooted, there is little understanding of how repeated child mortality experiences influence fertility behaviour and parity transition in Nigeria.Methods: Using birth history data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), we applied life table techniques and proportional-hazard regression model to explore the effect of child survival experience on parity transitions. We hypothesize that a woman with one or more child death experience is at elevated risk of progressing towards higher parities.Results: Our findings show that child mortality is concentrated among mothers living in deprived conditions especially in rural areas of the northern part of Nigeria and among those with little or no education and, among those belonging to Hausa\/Fulani ethnicity and Islam religion. Mothers with repeated experience of child deaths were significantly at a higher rate of progressing to higher parities than their counterparts (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.31-1.61), when adjusted for relevant biological and socio-demographic characteristics.Conclusion: Recurrent experience of child deaths exacerbates the risks to higher parity transition. Interventions aimed at reducing fertility in Nigeria should target promoting child survival and family planning concurrently."

    "abstract": "This institutional-based cross-sectional study examines the burden of self-medication during pregnancy in a middle-income country setting and the impact on fetal wellbeing. Using a blend of open-ended and indication-oriented questionnaires, 346 pregnant women at term were interviewed about their pregnancy complaints and drug intake. Inferential statistical data analysis was employed with level of significance (\u03b1) set at 0.05. Excluding routine supplements and vaccinations, 251 (72.5%) women used medicines, of whom 79 (31.5%) had self-medicated. Consuming drugs without prescription was associated with increased US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) risk category (\u03c72= 8.375; P = 0.015). There is therefore a need to scale up efforts towards educating women about the dangers of self-medication, while also introducing effective restrictive policies on over-the-counter drug sales."

Methods: It is a 3-year retrospective analysis of all the obstetrics cases with intrapartum foetal distress. Results: There were 301 cases reviewed. The birth asphyxia incidence rate was 233\/1000 live births and the perinatal death rate was 47\/1000 live births. Suspicion of foetal distress was premised on the presence of persistent tachycardia or bradycardia during intermittent auscultation. Main resuscitative measures were left lateral repositioning of patient, fast saline infusion, intranasal oxygen administration and discontinuation of oxytocin infusion, if any. Only 124 (41.2%) of all the cases had delivery achieved within 2 h of diagnosis. Mean decision-delivery interval by caesarean section was 2.93 \u00b1 2.05 h. Socio-demographic factors (p= 0.001) and pregnancy risk category (p = 0.002) influenced incidence of birth asphyxia. Conclusion: To reduce subsisting high perinatal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, it is best that at the least referral hospitals should have advanced facilities for foetal monitoring and shortened surgical intervention time."

While socioeconomic and religious barriers continue to exist, psychosocial factors such as negative contraceptive perceptions by male partners may influence both spousal FP demand and use. Therefore, this research investigates the influence of male partners\u2019 contraceptive perceptions on spousal FP demand and use. Methods We analysed the couple dataset from the 2013 Nigeria DHS. Results One in five men held the perception that contraceptive use is women's business whereas two in five men reported that women who use family planning may become promiscuous, especially older men, those with no formal education, Muslims and residents in rural areas and northern region. Results from regression models, controlling for relevant sociodemographic characteristics, show that men's perception that contraception is women's business did not significantly influence FP demand. However, their fear that women who use family planning may become promiscuous was associated with lower odds of FP demand (AOR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76\u20130.97) and increased the odds of traditional methods use (AOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.79).

A community-based, cross-sectional sexual survey of 161 young people aged between 15 and 35 who had dropped out of school or college was performed in Ado-Ekiti, south-west Nigeria, in April 2015. One hundred and nineteen of the respondents (73.9%) had had sexual intercourse. Mean age at sexual debut was 19.08\u00b13.5 years. Of those with sexual experience, 79 (66.4%) had their sexual debut with a previous boy\/girlfriend and 33 (27.7%) had it in their current relationship. Three (2.5%) respondents had first sex with a stranger. About 90% were still having sexual intercourse within 12 months of the survey; more males had had sex than females (81.1% versus 67.8%). Around 80% of those with sexual exposure practised a form of contraception, mainly use of the male condom, but fewer than 25% were all-time contraceptive users. Coming from a single-parent family (p=0.04) or from a family of poor economic status (AOR: 7.41; 95% CI: 0.69-0.83) were found to be associated with sexual debut by the age of 19 and premarital sex, respectively, in these young people. Unprotected sexual intimacy was found to be high among young school\/college drop-outs in this region of Nigeria. This group of young people need targeted reproductive health intervention as they represent a potent route for HIV transmission in the region."

A three-year retrospective case-control study of stillbirths at Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital. Results. The stillbirth rate was 33 per 1000 births. Based on Baird-Pattinson classification of the primary obstetric causes of stillbirth, adverse intrapartum events, hypertensive diseases, and unexplained intrapartum fetal deaths were topmost causes of stillbirths. In comparison with the controls, other identified predictors of SB were grand multiparity (p = 0.016), delays in seeking medical care and\/or in receiving treatment (p = 0.001), wrong initial diagnosis (p = 0.001), inadequate intrapartum monitoring (p = 0.001), and inappropriate clinical management (p = 0.001). Conclusion. Stillbirth rate remains high in our setting. Elimination of obstacles to accessing care, effective management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, updated health facilities, improved dedication to duty, and retraining of health workers will reduce the prevalence."

Aims: To compare the efficacy of combined Foley's catheter and vaginal misoprostol with Foley's catheter or low-dose vaginal misoprostol alone for cervical ripening. Materials and methods: Women with a singleton pregnancy admitted at term for cervical ripening and IOL based on clinical indication were randomised into three groups. Oxytocin augmentation was done in the groups as indicated. Significant tests were done using chi square, Fisher's exact and analysis of variance tests. Results: A total of 210 women were randomised into the study. Women in the combined group (Foley's catheter and vaginal misoprostol) had significantly higher postcervical ripening Bishop's score than the women in the other two groups; P = 0.001. Cervical ripening time, induction\u2013delivery time and cervical ripening\u2013delivery interval were significantly shorter in the combined group compared to the other two groups; P = 0.001. Also, women in the combined group required significantly lesser oxytocin augmentation than the other two groups; P = 0.001. There was no difference in Apgar scores at 1 or 5 minutes or in special baby care unit admission among the groups. There were no reported cases of uterine contractile abnormalities or rupture in this study. Conclusion: Combined Foley's catheter and vaginal misoprostol provide a shorter duration to the achievement of cervical ripening."

    "cu_author": "Abiodun 'Abbey' Adanikin",

    "abstract": "Background: The pursuit of formal education now causes many people in developing countries to marry later in life, thereby leading to increased premarital sex and unintended pregnancies. Efforts have been made to characterize awareness and use of emergency contraception (EC) among undergraduate students in public universities in Nigeria; however, it is not known if students in private tertiary institutions adopt different practices or if having an affluent family background plays a role. This pilot study therefore aimed to assess the awareness and use of EC among students at a private Nigerian university toward assisting education planners in developing strategies in improving students' reproductive well-being. Results: Out of 94 female students, 42 (44.7%) had sexual experience, but only 32 (34.0%) were currently sexually active. Six students (6.4%) had had unwanted pregnancies, of which all but one were terminated. Fifty-seven respondents (60.6%) were aware of EC, though only 10 (10.6%) ever practiced it. The greatest source of EC information was from health workers and peers; the lowest source was family or relatives. Most respondents desired orientation and availability of EC on campus. EC awareness among the students was predicted by upper social class background (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-7.45) and upbringing in the Federal Capital Territory (adjusted OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 1.56-14.22). Conclusions: Though awareness of EC was higher among the private university students in this study than at most public universities, there was no difference in EC usage. A high pregnancy termination rate was observed; dilatation and curettage were mainly adopted. In Nigeria, youth-friendly reproductive health information and access should not be limited to government-owned tertiary institutions but also extended to private ones."

Methods A cohort of 181 women with live births was followed up for 6 months after delivery. Enquiry about the time of first intercourse after childbirth, associated dyspareunia, use of contraception, etc was made during the postnatal clinic visits and\/or by telephone contact. Results Fifty (27.6%) had coitus within six weeks of childbirth, it increased to 115 (63.3%) at three months and 127 (70.2%) by six months post-delivery. Prevalence of dyspareunia was 36.2%. Eighty three (65.4%) of sexually active women practiced contraception which was predominantly use of male condom and withdrawal method. Co-habitation with husband (adjusted OR: 6.30; 95% CI: 2.56-17.01; p = 0.001) and mode of delivery (adjusted OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.30-4.73; p = 0.006) were strong predictors of commencement of sexual intercourse within six months postpartum. Significantly fewer women who had Caesarean section resumed coitus within six months when compared with those who had vaginal deliveries (59.2% versus 78.4%). Perineal injury did not predict resumption of coitus or experience of dyspareunia. Conclusion In contrast to the norm, more women in southwest Nigeria are resuming coitus soon after childbirth.

To improve the situation, iron supplement is routinely prescribed during pregnancy. We therefore examine the impact of the intervention as being currently practised in our clinical setting.METHODS: In total, 255 prenatal clinic attendees who had more than 8 weeks of prescribed iron supplements were sampled. Data was obtained on their socio-demographic features, haemoglobin concentration at booking, compliance with iron supplements and third trimester haemoglobin value.RESULTS: Observed iron supplementation compliance rate was 184(72.2%). There was a significant drop in mean haemoglobin (Hb) concentration between the two time points (booking Hb: 32.56\u00b12.99; third trimester Hb: 31.67\u00b13.01; mean diff: 0.89\u00b13.04; t = 4.673; 95% CI= 0.52-1.27; p= <0.001). Anaemia increased from 132(51.8%) to 150(58.8%) by the third trimester. Increase in anaemia occurred in both iron-compliant and non-compliant groups. Non-compliance however had higher odds of predicting anaemia by the third trimester (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.03-3.26; p: 0.04).CONCLUSION: Although iron supplementation is still a good intervention in developing countries, it is not sufficient to reduce overall prevalence of anaemia by the third trimester. There is a need to look beyond the approach and reinforce the importance of better feeding practices, food fortification and reduced frequency of pregnancies."

Evaluation of the reasons for these delays and their contributions to maternal deaths is rarely done for women with RTPs in resource-constrained settings. Patients and methods: This was a 3-year retrospective review of the case records of women with tubal pregnancies managed at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Clinical and sociodemographic parameters were obtained, including information on onset of symptoms and intervals between the symptoms and when help was sought and obtained at the hospital. Results: There were 92 cases of tubal pregnancies, giving an incidence of 18 per 1,000 births. Most of the patients were married (74.7%), parous (64.9%), and urban dwellers (76.9%), and 11% were severely anemic on arrival.

Although some regulatory efforts have been deployed to tackle this problem, less attention has been placed on the possible motivation for seeking prayer house intervention which could be hinged on the spiritual belief of patients about pregnancy and childbirth. This study therefore seeks to determine the perception of booked antenatal patients on spiritual care during pregnancy and their desire for such within hospital setting.Method: A total of 397 antenatal attendees from two tertiary health institutions in southwest Nigeria were sampled. A pretested questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic features of respondents, perception of spiritual care during pregnancy and childbirth; and how they desire that their spiritual needs are addressed. Responses were subsequently collated and analyzed.Results: Most of the women, 301 (75.8%), believe there is a need for spiritual help during pregnancy and childbirth. About half (48.5%) were currently seeking for help in prayer\/mission houses while another 8.6% still intended to. Overwhelmingly, 281 (70.8%) felt it was needful for health professionals to consider their spiritual needs. Most respondents, 257 (64.7%), desired that their clergy is allowed to pray with them while in labour and sees such collaboration as incentive that will improve hospital patronage. There was association between high family income and desire for collaboration of healthcare providers with one's clergy (OR 1.82; CI 1.03-3.21; p = 0.04).Conclusion: Our women desire spiritual care during pregnancy and childbirth. Its incorporation into maternal health services will improve hospital delivery rates."

However, there is growing concern that these assumptions may not be true and that a significant proportion of menopausal women may be tolerating reproductive health burden in silence"

Method A total of 216 eligible pregnant women were randomised into antenatal and postnatal counselling groups. The 'Antenatal group' received one-to-one antenatal contraceptive counselling on several occasions while the 'Postnatal group' received a single one-to-one contraceptive counselling session at the sixth week postnatal check, as is routinely practised. All participants were contacted six months postpartum by telephone or personal visit, and questioned about their contraceptive use, if any. Results More women who had multiple antenatal contraceptive counselling sessions used modern contraceptive methods than those who had a single postnatal counselling session (57% vs. 35%; p = 0.002). There was also a significantly more frequent use of contraception among previously undecided patients in the Antenatal group (p = 0.014). Conclusion Multiple antenatal contraceptive counselling sessions improve the use of modern postpartum contraception."

    "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether rectally administered misoprostol can induce intestinal motility compared with oxytocin infusion when used to prevent primary postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean delivery. Methods: In a prospective randomized double-blind study in Nigeria, 218 parturients undergoing cesarean delivery who had risk factors for primary postpartum hemorrhage were enrolled between July 1, 2010, and March 31, 2011. Participants received 600 \u03bcg of rectal misoprostol or 20 intravenous units of oxytocin for 4 hours after surgery. The primary outcome was time until passage of flatus. Adverse effects, need for additional analgesic, and length of hospital stay were also assessed. Results: The misoprostol group had a significantly shorter mean postoperative interval to passage of flatus (20.27 \u00b1 7.77 hours versus 38.34 \u00b1 10.98 hours; P < 0.001) and commencement of regular diet (21.08 \u00b1 7.69 hours versus 39.13 \u00b1 10.94 hours; P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were more frequent, albeit not significantly, in the misoprostol group: nausea, 6.4% versus 1.8%; vomiting, 7.3% versus 2.8%; and abdominal distension, 3.7% versus 2.8%. The need for additional analgesic was the same in the 2 groups. Conclusion: After cesarean delivery, rectal misoprostol had the added benefit of inducing intestinal motility. Misoprostol might be considered in a clinical setting where postoperative ileus is anticipated."

In parts one and two of this report, we situate experimental books in the context of academic research and map current experiments in book publishing in order to create a typology accompanied by a selection of examples of experimental book publishing projects. In part three of this report we then review existing resources on tools, platforms, and software used in the production of experimental books, and we sketch a roadmap and methodology towards the creation of the online resource mentioned previously. To support the pilot cases we have made a start with exploring two key practices within experimental publishing and the creation of experimental books that feature within this online resource: collaborative writing and annotation. As such we outline tools, platforms, software, and workflows that support and enable these practices next to describing the desired aspects we argue this technical infrastructure should cover."

She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality.Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make."

    "abstract": "This report explores how publishers and authors can promote, nurture, and facilitate interaction with openly available books. Open access (obviously) opens up scholarship, but it also offers scope to enhance interactions between books, scholars, publishers, resources, librarians, and of course readers. This might take the form of creating communities and conversations around books, of gathering comments and hyperlinks, or of enabling updating, remixing and reusing, translating, modifying, reviewing, versioning, and forking of existing books. Open access, in short can create additional value and new avenues and formats that go beyond openness, by changing how people interact with books. Research shows that making books available in open access enhances discovery and online consultation (Snijder, 2019), but the short outline above makes clear that there is still a lot to be done to stimulate, explore, and practice the full range of book interactions made possible by open access.The first part of this report provides a literature overview that identifies the opportunities that digital technologies and enhanced interactions with open access books can provide for scholarship; it outlines some of the main types of interactions around scholarship\u2014and around and as part of open access books more in particular\u2014that scholars are involved in; and it showcases some of the experiments within humanities book publishing with reuse and remix; finally it presents some of the main (technological and socio-cultural) inhibitions that have prevented further uptake of these practices. The second part of this report more closely explores the technical dependencies that the introduced interactions and affordances rely upon. Doing so, it outlines and showcases various open source tools, software, technologies, platforms, infrastructures, guidelines and best practices, that lend themselves to being adopted by publishers and authors (or by publishers and authors working in collaboration with each other) to facilitate interaction around their book(s). The third part of this report then summarises the findings of the previous parts and provides recommendations, guidelines, and strategies (again, both socio-cultural and technological) for publishers and authors to further open up their books and collections to community interaction and reuse.Who is this Report for?The main communities we want to reach with this report are publishers and authors\/scholars (or communities of scholars), to explore how they, by experimenting and often just making simple adjustments, can start to open up and stimulate interactions around their books. Where larger (commercial) publishers often have the resources to develop tools and workflows for interaction in-house (and often proprietary), scholar-led publishers, for example, although they have been at the vanguard of more experimental forms of publishing, have indicated that they often lack expertise and familiarity with more experimental forms of publishing and with the tools available to support them (Adema and Stone, 2017). We therefore focus in this report on open source tools and openly and freely available resources and guidelines that can help small-scale and not-for-profit book publishers that cannot afford to build their own custom platforms, to stimulate engagement around books. We also show various examples throughout this report of how publishers, publishing collectives and platforms, authors, and scholarly communities already are stimulating interaction around books in interesting ways and the tools and practices they have adopted to do so.This report focuses on interactions with books and on books within the humanities and social sciences in particular. Many of the types of interaction and interactive practices we describe within this report (such as for example open peer review and data mining), are being used and adopted more commonly within the STEM fields (where their uptake is also more widely researched). The humanities (and to a lesser extent the social sciences) in general have lower adoption rates where it concerns these types of practices and also have field specific preferences (as well as prejudices) towards many of these practices, which will be taken into account and further discussed in this report.Types of InteractionAs part of our research we have identified several types of scholarly interaction taking place around books. The first part of this report is structured around some of the more common kinds of interaction that open access books afford: annotations, open peer review, remix and reuse, social scholarship and networked books, and emergent practices (including versioning, forking, and human computer interactions). This report doesn\u2019t aim to cover all forms of interaction around books but has chosen to focus on the kinds of interactions that publishers and scholars would be able to promote and recreate with relatively simple adaptations to their workflows, systems, practices, and licensing. Each of the above identified types of interaction around books will be discussed in the next section, including how we can stimulate them and what obstacles currently exist towards their more general implementation. Throughout the next part of this report we will also be providing examples from within humanities book publishing to illustrate the different kinds of interaction.---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---The report has itself been published in an experimental way. Making use of the advanced versioning functionalities offered by PubPub, we will iteratively update this document over the remainder of the project, thus allowing us to incorporate user feedback and new technological developments.Hence, we would be really grateful for constructive feedback from the communities out there who are already experimenting with new forms of interaction. Please don\u2019t hesitate to leave comments either on the PubPub version (account and login required), or get in touch via email at wp6@copim.ac.ukThe report is published as a PDF here on Zenodo, while a more interactive book version that is available as a PubPub book."

    "date": "23 Mar 2021",
    "abstract": "Within the field of open access (OA) publishing, community-led publishing projects are experimenting increasingly with new forms of collaboration and organisation. They do so by focusing on setting up horizontal alliances between independent projects within a certain sector (e.g., scholar-led presses), or vertically across sectors with other not-for-profit organisations (e.g., through collaborations with libraries, universities, and funders), in order to create multi-stakeholder ecologies within scholarly publishing. Yet at the same time, imaginaries for future modes of OA knowledge production are still controlled through demands for \u2018scalability\u2019 and \u2018sustainability\u2019, which are both seen as preconditions for scholarly communication models and practices to succeed and to be efficient. But they are also prerequi\u00adsites to receive funding for publishing projects or infrastructure development. The scalability of open models is perceived as essential to compete in a landscape dominated by a handful of major corporate players.Drawing on our work with the Radical Open Access Collective, the ScholarLed consortium, and the Community-led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Mono\u00adgraphs (COPIM) project, this article outlines an alternative organisational prin\u00adciple for governing community-led publishing projects based on mutual reliance, care, and other forms of commoning. Termed \u2018scaling small\u2019, this principle eschews standard approaches to organisational growth that tend to flatten community diversity through economies of scale. Instead, it puts forward the idea that scale can be nurtured through intentional collaborations between community-driven pro\u00adjects that promote a bibliodiverse ecosystem while providing resilience through resource sharing and other kinds of collaboration. Following Anna Tsing\u2019s recom\u00admendations to keep in mind how reimagining our knowledge practices requires we pay particular attention to articulations between the scalable and the nonscalable (Tsing, 2012), what is needed to enable this is, first and foremost, a rethinking of existing systems and infrastructures and how they currently function \u2013 systems that have historically developed and been continuously remade to encourage fur\u00adther scalability. We further explore the possibilities of scaling small with particular reference to Anna Tsing\u2019s work on the \u2018latent commons\u2019 and Massimo De Angelis\u2019 discussion of \u2018boundary commoning\u2019, examining how these concepts are on display within the Radical Open Access Collective, ScholarLed and the COPIM project. As we will argue, reimagining the relations within publishing beyond a mere calcula\u00adtive logic, i.e., one that is focused on assessing the sustainability of alternative models, is essential in not-for-profit OA publishing environments, particularly if we want new forms of collaboration to arise and to redefine the future of scholarly publishing in communal settings."

    "abstract": "This report is the first of three annual reports and a major deliverable submitted to Arcadia \u2013 a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin, by the Community-Led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM) project.COPIM is committed to exploring possible solutions to some of the most pressing barriers currently preventing small publishers from interfacing with large-scale organisations and processes. As a result, COPIM is developing a significantly enriched not-for-profit and open source ecosystem for OA (open access) book publishing that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly within Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) publishing.The adoption of alternative infrastructures, business models, preservation structures, and governance procedures to be scoped and developed through COPIM will enable increased economic resilience and enhanced capacities for open access books at smaller and larger scales. COPIM's approach will offer Higher Education institutions and HSS researchers sustainable publishing models they control, increased publishing options, and new revenue streams and cost reductions to build a more equitable horizontal and co-operative knowledge sharing community. During the first year of the project, COPIM has established a solid foundation in the areas of collaborative research, infrastructure development, project management, and outreach and community building. Successfully adapting its approach to face a set of unforeseen challenges, the project has achieved the majority of its deliverables and milestones across all work packages, in some areas even outperforming the initial goals set.The list of key output and activities delivered includes:the publication of two major scoping reportsthe successful organisation and documentation of eleven workshops with more than 120 national and international high-profile stakeholders representing 18 countriesthe successful switch to an online-only approach due to COVID-19, which now includes the setup and iterative extension of an Outreach and Dissemination network that is combining a variety of channels including social media and open community platforms;and the initial setup and continuous further development of a resource to make open access book metadata available in an open, transparent and participatory way, which will integrate into the larger Open Dissemination System, to be developed in Years 2 and 3.The project has successfully fostered engagement with the work packages\u2019 variety of stakeholders (i.e. librarians, publishers, authors, technology providers and the general public), bringing together key experts and those interested in learning more about scholar-led not-for-profit OA book publishing. Next to its own event organisation and outreach activities, COPIM has also been invited to participate in a variety of external conferences, events, and networks by organisations and projects such as Invest in Open Infrastructure, OASPA, OPERAS, LIBER, the Next Generation Libraries Project, and the Open Access Book Network, The British Library, OpenAIRE, COAR, and EIFL.The overall progress made during this first year seems particularly noteworthy as the project not only had to face the challenges of first-year setup, including early minor delays in staff recruitment, onboarding, and the organisation of basic project management and governance structures; COPIM was also faced with a set of unprecedented challenges that permeated all aspects of the delivery process and will potentially impact the remainder of the project going forward. The main challenges include Brexit and its impact on the economy\u2014and corresponding uncertainties\u2014and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all systemic consequences that this entails.Building on the foundational research, project management structures and outreach networks that have been successfully established in Year 1, the project is eager to continue on its path to further developing the envisioned infrastructures, pilot cases, governance structures, and outreach programmes it is set to deliver in Years 2 and 3."

    "abstract": "Attached to this issue of Convolution are four tear-out postcards, printed on the back flap of the cover. These have been designed to evoke the now largely forgotten medium of Reprint Request Cards. Today made obsolescent by the ease of PDFs downloaded directly from journals, databases, or perhaps torrented and accessed via so-called shadow libraries, Reprint Request Cards once constituted an important tool among communities of readers and writers and served as means of obtaining copies of publications directly from their authors. Although most prominent among scholars in the (social) sciences, due to the historical centrality of journals in scientific publication, Reprint Request Cards speak poignantly to the nature of contemporary publishing and draw attention to the changes brought about by the turn to reading online, irrespective of the disciplinary context.Reprint Requests, Leung, Robson, and Siu note, \u201cbegun as a matter of courtesy within a small group of scholars\u201d and by the early 1920s became an established and common method of accessing and circulating publications within the scientific community.  The mechanism of obtaining a reprint was simple: having identified an article of interest, a reader mailed the author a card requesting it and, a few weeks later, received a printed copy of the publication in the post. While a reprint could have been requested via a regular letter, libraries, publishers, or indexing services, such as The Institute for Scientific Information, provided standardized Reprint Request Cards as well as indexes of authors\u2019 addresses. This made the process of requesting publications easy and, perhaps most importantly, encouraged an active community of readers and writers to emerge. A drive for engaged readership informed the practice of sharing publications in response to Reprint Request: \u201cI remember the delight of receiving hundreds of reprint requests,\u201d writes Steven Willey, \u201cfor individual papers that I fought long and hard with reviewers to get published.\u201dMotivated by a similar desire, we provide here a set of four Reprint Request Cards for readers to use themselves or pass onto family, friends and colleagues. We invite the Convolution community to post a card to us and to receive in response an essay in which we take on the form of Reprint Request to explore in more depth questions so central to any attempt at writing, reading, and publishing, i.e. questions of circulation, distribution and access and, in particular, their challenges today with respect to experimental forms of writing and publishing. We look at Reprint Request Cards as characteristic forms of expression in their own right, which draw attention to the significance of the ways in which we encounter writing. But we also set this exercise in motion as an experiment in thinking about modes of community building that an act of publishing makes possible outside of the immediate contexts of today\u2019s online sociability, which we have grown to take for granted.We hope that turning to Reprint Request Cards will reintroduce to those who choose to post them the pleasure of the postcard \u2013 of sticking a stamp, of dropping it into a letter box \u2013 so rare today. Our cards, while reproducing the format of the traditional Reprint Requests, also disrupt it. They are designed to invite our prospective readers to introduce themselves to us by filling in the blank side of the card, playfully exploring the form of the postcard and the processes of reading and writing which these cards are to initiate. As the cards arrive, we hope both to forge new connections between our text and its readers and to get to know the unique community that Convolution brings together.---Alexander K.C.

National Open Science policies name OA Monogaphs explicitly to help achieve openness in the way research and scholarship are conducted and made available.To support better incorporation of OA monographs in overall OA policies and approaches, Knowledge Exchange, in 2017 and 2018 produced a landscape study on Open Access and Monographs and theresults of a stakeholder survey. Outcomes indicate that there is a crucial need for international concertation and harmonisation among communities.To follow-up Knowledge Exchange invited experts and stakeholders from academic libraries, universities, authors, publishers, EC-officers and others for an international two-day workshop in Brussels. On 8 and 9 November 2018 intense exchanges and brainstorming resulted in the information and recommendations you will find in our latest publication Towards a Roadmap for Open Access Monographs."

    "abstract": "Unruly gestures presents a hybrid performative intervention by means of video, text, and still images. With this experimental essay we aspire to break down various preconceptions about reading\/writing gestures. Breaking away from a narrative that sees these gestures foremost as passive entities \u2013 as either embodiments of pure subjective intentionality, or as bodily movements shaped and controlled by media technologies (enabling specific sensory engagements with texts) \u2013 we aim to reappraise them. Indeed, in this essay we identify numerous dominant narratives that relate to gestural agency, to the media-specificity of gestures, and to their (linear) historicity, naturalness and humanism. This essay disrupts these preconceptions, and by doing so, it unfolds an alternative genealogy of \u2018unruly gestures.\u2019 These are gestures that challenge gestural conditioning through particular media technologies, cultural power structures, hegemonic discourses, and the biopolitical self. We focus on reading\/writing gestures that have disrupted gestural hegemonies and material-discursive forms of gestural control through time and across media. Informed by Tristan Tzara\u2019s cut-up techniques, where through the gesture of cutting the Dadaists subverted established traditions of authorship, intentionality, and linearity, this essay has been cut-up into seven semi-autonomous cine-paragraphs (accessible in video and print). Each of these cine-paragraphs confronts specific gestural preconceptions while simultaneously showcasing various unruly gestures."

Common characteristics are that they are open access (OA), digital first, library-based, and they often offer a smaller set of services than a traditional publisher, blurring the line between publisher and platform. In tandem, a small but notable number of academics and researchers have set up their own publishing initiatives, often demonstrating an innovative or unique approach either in workflow, peer review, technology or business model.These new publishing initiatives have a potentially disruptive effect on the scholarly communication environment, providing new avenues for the dissemination of research outputs and acting as pathfinders for the evolution of academic publishing and the scholarly record.In this report, we have captured the current landscape of new university presses (NUPs) and academic-ledpresses (ALPs) emerging within the UK. Taking different approaches for these two types of press we have captured the take-up, reasoning and characteristics of these initiatives, as well as future plans. The report concludes with a series of recommendations to help support and foster new developments in this space, to share best practice and collaboration and to identify the tools and services that will facilitate further innovation.Jisc supports universities and researchers in the provision of new digital services and innovation. We will work with the community and stakeholders to decide how we can take forward some of the recommendations listed in this report for the benefit of our members and the research community."

    "abstract": "The Journal of Media Practice (JMP) has, over the years, through its focus on media practice as research, formed an invaluable platform for the communication and circulation of practice-based media-arts research. Through collaborations with its online digital companion, the ScreenWorks platform for peer-reviewed practice research in film and screen media, JMP has been a forerunner in championing and adopting the various multimodal forms practice-based and creative works can take within the context of an academic publication.[1] However, although media practice as a field and community embraces a plurality of media, the materiality of its scholarly forms of production and communication remain predominantly text-based. How then, should a journal of media practice extend from a speculative focus on what media practice as research could be, to an exploration of the alternative forms of communication and circulation it could enable?This special disrupted issue of the JMP has been conceptualised, edited and performed collectively by Coventry University\u2019s Centre for Disruptive Media (CDM) and the Disruptive Media Learning Lab (DMLL). Disruption, for us, should be seen as an affirmative practice, in the sense that it allows us to experiment with new forms of critique and to rethink and performatively disrupt some of academic publishing\u2019s core foundational concepts and practices, from the single author and the linear argument to the fixed and finalized text-object (for more on this alternative affirmative vision of disruption, see: Broekman et al. 2014; Hall 2016; J. Adema and Hall 2016). As editors, it was important to experiment with how media practice, in rethinking research as practice, could also be involved in disrupting the way we mediate this research through various formal and informal scholarly forms (including the academic journal).  As such we put forward a number of provocations with respect to what a \u2018journal of media practice\u2019 should or could be, to provide an alternative to the standard single-authored linear 8000-word journal article, that continues to dominate the field, as well as the Journal of Media Practice itself. What would experimental and interventionist forms of mediation and presentation in this respect look like for media practice? And how can JMP stimulate ongoing conversations `around these issues?  As such we wanted to explore three central questions in this special issue:How is media practice disruptive of and re-performing the way we do scholarly communication and education?How can JMP reconfigure (the politics of) its own practice?What should a disruptive \u2018journal\u2019 of media practice look \/ sound \/ feel like?"

Cary Wolfe insists \u201cthe nature of thought itself must change if it is to be posthumanist.\u201d1 Our argument, made manifest by this special issue of the Journal of Electronic Publishing, is that it is not only our ways of thinking about the world that must change if they are to be posthumanist, or at least not simply humanist; our ways of being and doing in the world must change too. In particular, we view the challenge to humanism and the human brought about by the emergence of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, robotics, bioscience, pre-emptive, cognitive, and contextual computing, as providing us with an opportunity to reinvent, radically, the ways in which we work, act, and think as theorists. In this respect, if \u201cposthumanism names a historical moment in which the decentering of the human by its imbrication in technical, medical, informatics, and economic networks is increasingly impossible to ignore,\u201d2 then it generates an opportunity to raise the kind of questions for the humanities we really should have raised long before now, but haven\u2019t because our humanist ideas, not just of historical change and progression (i.e. from human to posthuman, to what comes after the human),3 but of the rational, liberal, human subject, and the associated concepts of the author, the journal, and copyright that we have inherited with it, continue to have so much power and authority."

The first part of this chapter will provide an analysis of the way the cut and the practice of cutting have been theorized in remix studies, mostly from within a representationalist framework. This analysis will then be juxtaposed and entangled with a diffractive reading of a selection of critical theory, feminist new materialist and media studies texts. These specifically focus on the act of cutting from a performative perspective, from which I will explore what a posthumanist vision of remix and the cut might look like. In the second part of this essay, I will examine how the potential of the cut and related to that, how the politics inherent in the act of cutting, can affirmitively be applied to scholarly book publishing. How can we account for our own ethical entanglements as scholars in the becoming of the book? After analyzing how the book functions as an apparatus, a material-discursive formation or assemblage which enacts cuts, I will explore two publishing projects\u2014Living Books about Life and remixthebook\u2014that have tried to re-think and re-perform the apparatus. Both projects specifically take responsibility for the cuts they make in an effort to \u201ccut well.\u201d How have these projects established an alternative politics and ethics of the cut that is open to change, and what are their potential shortcomings?"

The availability of publication outlets for research monographs is crucial to the careers of researchers and to research assessment opportunities for universities with departments in those disciplines. Humanities and Social Sciences have suffered from the serials crises, as library funds for the purchase of monographs came under pressure.The Open Access model addresses the monograph crisis in two ways. By making a digital edition freely available through the Internet the access to and discoverability of the monograph are greatly improved. The Open Access model also provides the opportunity to find a new sustainable business model for monographs, based on the reduced production costs of the digital edition and building on emerging business models for Open Access journals. Open Access models for monographs differ from the models for Open Access journals, because the Open Access version of a monograph does not substitute printed books in the same way that e-journals are substituting printed journals. But although the business models may differ, there are no obstacles to achieve Open Access for books.There are clear benefits to the academic community and society at large and both publishers and funders are experimenting with a variety of models to enable Open Access to monographs."

It usesamongst others the example of the author\u2019s PhD dissertation currently in process,which is set up as a theoretical and practical intervention into existing discoursessurrounding the dominant form of formal communication within the Humanities: thescholarly monograph. A methodology of critical praxis is seen as an integral part ofthe research project as well as an important step in developing academic or researchliteracy through actively engaging in the production of communicative norms andpractices. Envisioning the book as a site of struggle over new forms and systems ofcommunication within academia, the dissertation argues for alternative ways ofthinking of and performing the monograph in an experimental manner. By making useof digital platforms, tools and media to share, remix and update the research as itevolves, the aim is to develop a digital, open and collaborative research practice. Thiswill offer a practical critique of the dominant structures, politics and practices ofproducing and distributing research results. This article thus argues for theempowering potential of critically analysing and actively engaging with the dominantnorms underlying communication in the Humanities as well as with the structures thatdetermine academic literacy and the established and accepted practices herein. Byarguing for a potential new future for the book within scholarly communication as anemergent and evolving form, based on accessibility, sharing, process and change, thisarticle makes a case for new ways of engaging a critical praxis that is morespeculatory, open-ended and experimental."

    "abstract": "In professional training programmes it is vital to ensure individuals have accomplished all required competencies before qualifying, otherwise patient safety could be placed at risk. This increased emphasis on patient safety and accountability has heightened the need for reliable, valid and suitable methods of assessment that not only can inform if learning outcomes have been achieved but can also promote and encourage learning. One method of assessment that has been traditionally applied in clinical education assessment is the Single Best Answer (SBA) question approach. In this review paper, the benefits and limitations associated with using SBA questions as a method of assessment were critically evaluated. The review clearly highlighted that emphasis should be mainly placed upon the design, coverage and content of SBA questions rather than evaluating the concept of SBA questions as a method of assessment. More specifically, the paper pointed towards the complex skills required for developing a set of SBA questions that can both promote learning as well as evaluate learning. To summarise, the need for defining the necessary skills and criteria required for the careful design and successful application of SBA exam paper is an important avenue to investigate."

They were subsequently randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions before repeating this task. Physiological (heart rate [HR] and blood pressure [BP]) and psychological (stress appraisals, state anxiety, task enjoyment, perceived competence, and goal attainment) data were captured at different intervals throughout the experiment.\n\nResults\nFactorial ANOVAs revealed participants: 1) performing under a controlling motivational context reported significantly higher HR (p < .001) and systolic BP (p < .05) post-task compared to those operating within an autonomy-supportive environment, 2) induced to an other-approach goal group, recorded significantly higher diastolic BP (p < .05) than those induced to self- and task-approach goals post-task, 3) adopting a task-approach goal under controlling conditions appraised the shooting task as significantly more threatening (p < .05) than their counterparts in the task-approach autonomy-supportive condition, and finally, 4) following approach-based goals under an autonomy-supportive context significantly improved their performance (p < .001) from pre-to post-shooting task.\n\nConclusions\nOur findings provide limited support for an integrated motivational model and are discussed in relation to their unique theoretical and practical utility."

Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to analyze the data.Results: Analysis revealed that athletes who perceived a high quality relationship experienced heightened levels of basic need satisfaction. Need satisfaction positively predicted self-determined motivation, which, in turn, linked to enhanced well-being. Moreover, mediation analyses supported the explanatory roles of need satisfaction and self-determined motivation within the model. Lastly, multi-sample SEM invariance testing revealed the model to be largely invariant across cultures.Conclusions: The results support the universal application of self-determination theory and the central role interpersonal relationships play in promoting well-being."

The practice-led research looks to establish performance art practice as a vital means of engaging with heritage sites and archives.  Considering how performance art practice can extend and embody heritage sites and archives by applying an anachronic methodological approach to historical material. The hypothesis being that to reveal the archive one must recognise the layers, loops, folds, and cracks of history. That to understand historical collections and heritage sites, artists must acknowledge the impossibility of truly defining fixed historiographic narratives. That any reading of history can only be understood in the present and embodied \u2018now\u2019 as defined by Fran\u00e7ois Hartog as Presentism and Hayden White and Frank Ankersmits narrativisit philosophy of history, and that performance art is the ideal way to articulate this.The performance works re-imagined the overlooked and uncatalogued in the sites and archives, presenting a ficto-factual reading of the past that montages the historically known and the unknown alongside cultural references, collective memory, and meta narrative structures. Working with un-catalogued and partially catalogued collections the performance series embody the historical variables in these disordered and fractured archives. The performances mined the multi-directional presence of the historical sites supporting a contemporaneous fictioning (as defined by David Burrows and Simon O\u2019Sullivan) that collates past, present, and future.The performative qualities of smoke, fog and mist are applied in the performance works to create an obfuscated and temporally disjunctive embodiment of the historical material within a contemporary art space. These miasmas are discussed in the thesis in the context of collective memory, cinema, and transmission of affect (as defined by Teresa Brenan). The Notes for a Performance series, accompanying publications and thesis contribute new knowledge in the fields of chronopolitics and performance art practice, situating the research in relation to these contemporary art forms and creative meta-narrative writing."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The housing crisis around the world that caused by the uncontrolled population growth and immigration particularly in large cities urged the demand of more innovative approaches as the traditional construction methods unable to meet the rising demands. Baghdad is Iraq capital which is an example sufferingfrom housing deficit with 451,080 units in 2009 and the number is claimed to be double in 2021. The study aimed to find a sufficient solution for Baghdad housing crises and to take Al-Sadr City: as a case study in Baghdad to implement feasible housing solutions by adopting a modern method of Construction. Al-Sadr City, the most populated district in Baghdad with 2 million people suffers from severe housing crises due to the high occupancy rate per unit, slums and urban issues; high density reached 1527 person per hectare; bout 13 person per unit as residential occupancy rate a double more than the normal rate as only 6 person per unit. The traditional method is unable to solve such City housing crises; hence, The London Model that adopted (OSM)offsite manufacturing housing took as a model due to the similarities to Baghdad housing crises and situation as well as its advantages in term of Cost-efficiency, Speed of construction, health and safety and the environmentalperformance. The study aims to propose solutions for Al-Sadr City housing issues based on London Model in term of planning, designing and application and examine the feasibility of London model to be implemented ashousing solutions for Al-Sadr City. A comprehensive methodological approached of mixed-methodological (quantitative and qualitative) approach comprise a multiple method such as: interviews, case study and questionnaire were conducted including two consecutive stages to propose a practical plan to implement the offsite manufactured homes in Al-Sadr City including planning (site location, urban planning, housing preferences) and construction; implementation50 participants (Al-Sadr City residents) took part in the questionnaire while 7 interviews were held with architecture and construction professionals. The key findings of the stage one, the study propose for the site locations of the new housing projects that linked the housing shortage and slums to be outside the City based on the data collected, additionally, the slums\u2019 location should demolished and transferring to the green areas. Key findings of the second stage, London model is highly feasible in term of the ofimplementation due to their advantages as compared to traditional method, However, barriers such as lack of skilled workers, public awareness, high temperature should be overcomed by training, government support,enhance public awareness and focus on thermal insulation, hence practical plan could be implemented.KEYWORDS: Housing Model, Future, High-Density Cities, planning, designing, London, Baghdad."

    "abstract": "Six sigma has long been deemed a quality initiative in the construction industry. There exists a limited use of six sigma within the UK construction industry and there are many reasons for this. Primarily there seems to be a misconception about the capabilities of six sigma in construction-specific context. Verylittle research has been done for six-sigma as a process improvement initiative for construction.Therefore, in this dissertation, the capability of six sigma to be used as a process improvement management strategy within the UK construction industry is explored in order to better propagate this method and increase its use within the industry. The current stance of six sigma within construction context is explored, drawing out the benefits and challenges of using its principles, further explaining why the UK\u2019s construction industry lacks its application. After a detailed literature review, two case studies are presented of UK construction projects and companies which used six sigma to enhance process performance. The case studies were critically analysed to draw out the benefits and the challenges experienced in order to finally provide recommendations which will encourage the industry, whether in research or in practice to further make use of six sigma as a process performance enhancer"

    "abstract": "In the past few years, the housing sector has witnessed an increase in the application of modern methods of construction (MMC) in the construction processes to address the existing housing shortage and improve the quality of buildings. However, despite the widely reported benefits of such methods, their uptake within the industry has been limited. This paper reports the findings made from a research that sought to investigate the effectiveness of MMC in terms of cost and time. A questionnaire survey was applied whereby five of the top construction companies in the country and 30 academicians it the field of construction were interviewed. The results obtained indicate that the current utilisation of MMC in the large and medium-sized housing companies is insufficient, but the level is expected to increase due to the growing pressure to improve on cost, time, quality, productivity, wastages, and health and safety of the workers. However, the perceived higher capital cost compared to the traditional method has been a major hindrance to the adoption of MMC. Despite this, as for a revolution in the construction industry of using modern construction methods, off-site MMC is not every company choice of construction form due to its higher capital and initial costs. This paper recommends a set of strategies that can be used to address the uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of MMC and improve its usage among the construction companies"

It is a material much less intensive in resource and energy use and accounts for far less greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle in comparison to steel and concrete; the two most dominating materials in the Canadian construction industry. Mass-timber is an engineered product, which requires the use of prefabrication and CNC machining. Although this process creates much safer working environments and significantly improves the quality of the delivered products, theoretically allowing mass-timber buildings to go even higher, it requires a high level of collaboration and automation at the beginning stages of the project. It requires strong building information modelling (BIM) which is also a relatively new technological process in the industry. Several tall mass-timber projects have recently been constructed however; there has been limited documentation of the strategies and processes needed for a successful project,"

Many sources, such as, websites, videos, books, show that modular housing is extremely efficient regarding time and cost. However, this construction type is not more popular than onsite building. The purpose of this project is to find the reason, why is not modular construction taking over traditional building style and what are the barriers of implementing prefabricated houses in UK housing sector. The primary and secondary data analysed in the project shows that building modularly has many great advantages, for example, lower costs, faster construction, modern design and significant sustainability. Moreover, the project analyses main barriers when implementing modular in the housing sector of United Kingdom, which are high costs of land, low land availability, transportation costs, quality relation to time and cost. The project indicates research on barriers and implications that lay behind modular construction in the United Kingdom housing sector."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe UK as a welfare state spends about 30% of the gross domestic product on social expenditures. The acute and biting shortage of housing, particularly social and affordable housing is responsible for the spiralling house prices and rents leading to an affordability crisis. Evidence-based research shows that the UK needs to build over 300,000 houses a year to meet the rising demand, particularly from young adults and families with low-to-middle incomes. As a result, there has been a worrying increase in overcrowding, homelessness, evictions and rent arrears. This research study aimed to investigate prefabrication, also known as modular construction as a solution to tackling the housing crisis in the UK. A mixed method approach was used to collect raw data. As such, five major construction firms were selected as the case study organisations for the research study. The respondents had a senior position in the organisations. The data collection methods that were adopted are qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires). The data were analysed using thematic analysis in which emergent themes were identified throughout the interviews and the questionnaires. Findings suggested that the housing crisis is not about houses; instead, it is about individuals. Perceptions about prefabricated houses among the low, middle and high-income earners are largely negative whose implication is that individuals would rather wait to build traditional homes in the future than opt for a prefabricated home. Although traditional home ownership is slipping out of reach for the majority, the demand for prefabricated homes is still low. In urban areas, modular construction is practised on a small scale with the main market limitations being the small size of the domestic market and the existing building regulations which prohibit the use of inflammable materials in urban areas. Moreover, it was found that prefabricated homes may provide short-term and long-term solutions to the housing crisis since they address and resolve some of the most critical issues associated with traditional housing but not limited to high costs, longer construction periods and uncertain budgets."

    "abstract": "It is still a lively debate on whether Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) certification has a significant increase on the capital cost of a building. There is a previous study mentioned about half of the investors or developers said there is a significant extra cost in BREEAM certified building, but BRE said otherwise. Undoubtedly, the capital cost is one of main considerations for investor and developer to construct a building. Yet, business industry sector consumes about 49% of energy consumption in the UK. Achieving higher financial return then become one the solution to encourage BREEAM certification on the commercial building. Higher financial return often associated with the health of cash flow into the company. In a commercial building, occupancy rate is vital for a company to predict their cash flow. Nevertheless, occupancy rate is also influenced by the rent and sale\u2019s fee. Even with low occupancy rates, the building owners still have to pay the building operating cost and property taxes. However, there is little or no study about BREEAM certification\u2019s impact on occupancy rates in UK\u2019s commercial buildings. The main aim of this research is to increase the BREEAM certified buildings, especially the excellent and outstanding rating, by demonstrating whether BREEAM certification has impacts on Occupancy Rates in the UK\u2019s Commercial Buildings. Research method employed in this study is a mixed research method. The result of the analysis from the questionnaire will be complement by interview analysis from experts who are from BREEAM related field. The findings showed that BREEAM certification has positive impacts on occupancy rates in the UK\u2019s commercial buildings."

    "abstract": "The United Kingdom is currently facing a housing shortage and has been for many years, caused mostly by natural growth in population, immigration and an aging housing stock. The solution to combat this problem is not as simple as constructing many hundreds of thousands of homes across the country, with many setbacks caused by economic, environmental and social concerns. The design and planning of individual residential projects, with fundamentally sustainable schemes could help to mitigate the concerns that are causing setbacks to house building. Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) is the world\u2019s longest established method of assessing,rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings produced by Building Research Establishment (BRE). ImplementingBREEAM on construction projects can vastly increase their sustainability compared to those that simply follow regulations.Projects that follow BREEAM specifications covered any additional costs by lower running costs during the building\u2019s life. Providing people in the UK with homes which are built in a highly sustainable manner may allow huge benefits that outweigh the costs for both of the residents and the wider population. The general knowledge and consciences of people is also increasing for a more sustainable world, and as construction can contribute but also take away greatly from the sustainability of society, this approach to building seems obvious and yet is nowhere near mainstream as one may expect. This study looks to investigate the reasons behind a low proportion of BREEAM implementation on residential projects, when at first glance the benefits seem to greatly outweigh the costs. Secondary data gathered through a desk study was used to help determine the costs and benefits of residential projects that have implemented BREEAM. The researcher also attempted to gather primary data in the form of interviews and a questionnaire, gaining an insight into a current construction industry view on the usage ofBREEAM."

However, despite a few prior studies acknowledging the negative externalities of political activity, little attention has been paid to CPA\u2019s dark side. In this paper, we draw on institutional and corporate governance insights to examine the relationship between CPA and bribery, which is arguably the greatest institutional failure in developing countries. Using pooled data from over 25,000 firms in 41 African countries, we find that lobbying and firm-level bribery are positively related. This relationship is weakened by in-country internet penetration and foreign ownership of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that business-government relations in weak institutional environments help to perpetuate corruption. They also suggest that internet penetration and foreign ownership help to illuminate the dark side of CPA. Leveraging this understanding, we make important contributions to the literature and highlight pertinent practical implications."

Drawing on resource dependency logics, we explore why and how firms orchestrate CPA in the institutionally challenging context of Nigeria. Our findings show that firms deploy four context-fitting but ethically suspect political strategies: affective, financial, pseudo-attribution and kinship strategies. We leverage this understanding to contribute to CPA in emerging countries by arguing that corporate political strategies are shaped by the reciprocity and duality of dependency relationships between firms and politicians, and also by advancing that these strategies reflect institutional weaknesses and unique industry-level opportunities. Importantly, we shed light on the muttered dark side of CPA. We develop a CPA framework and discuss the research, practical and policy implications of our findings."

We find that Chinese acquirer shareholders experience higher returns from the acquisitions in firms with no government involvements than those where government is involved. Our study demonstrates that stock-financed acquisitions maximise the wealth gains of shareholders than cash-backed acquisitions. Our finding further shows that using cash to finance government backed acquisitions yields extra wealth for investors on the announcement date whilst the market experience higher abnormal returns when stocks are used to finance the acquisition of privately held targets.

Mild steel solid wire AWS ER70S-6 was used to print WAAM walls on substrates that were rigidly clamped to H-profiles. DIC was used to monitor the bending deformation of WAAM parts during unclamping from the H-profiles, and residual stresses were calculated from the strain field captured during unclamping. Residual stresses determined from the proposed DIC-based method were verified with an analytical model and validated by the results from established residual stress measurement techniques, i.e., the contour method and X-ray diffraction."

This study focuses on aluminum alloy 5183 with respect to the residual stress formation and distribution in WAAM builds. Residual stresses were determined using the contour method. The effects of processing conditions, such as substrate thickness, interlayer temperature, and deposit height on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses were investigated. Substrate thickness was found to have a major influence on the residual stress distribution along deposit height. Tensile residual stress up to the value of the material yield strength was present. The majority part of the deposit showed tensile stress while substrate showed compensating compressive residual stress. Lower interlayer temperature samples exhibited residual stresses of higher degree of magnitude compared with sample produced using higher interlayer temperature. Deposit height, i.e., total number of layers affected stress distribution pattern similar to substrate thickness."

This type of sample is often used for the measurement of the fatigue crack growth rate. The contour method was used for experimental determinations of residual stress. In addtion, residual stress in the C(T) coupons was estimated by finite element (FE) analysis. A good agreement was achieved between the contour method and FE analysis. The oscillation\u2010path wall had the lowest residual stress values. For the single bead walls built with various process conditions, residual stress was significantly reduced after removing the substrate.

Concerns for metallic parts built via SLM are the process-induced residual stresses, and anisotropic mechanical properties. This paper investigates the effect of residual stresses on the fatigue crack growth rate of SLM Ti6Al4V in as-built and stress-relieved conditions. Neutron diffraction and the contour method are employed to measure residual stresses in compact-tension samples. Neutron diffraction results are in good agreement with the contour method. It was found that tensile stresses are present at the notch root and the free edge areas, and compressive stress is seen in the middle of the sample. The tensile stresses in the as-built condition resulted in a higher fatigue crack growth rate. After stress relieving by heat treatment, the tensile residual stress diminished by around 90%, resulting in decreased crack growth rate. The build direction was seen to affect the crack growth rate, although the trend was different between the as-built and stress-relieved conditions."

    "abstract": "Cold spray (CS) is a solid-state additive material deposition technique, which has gained attention in the aerospace industry as a potentially viable technology for structural repair of high-value parts made of high-strength alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-64). Residual stresses build up in the substrate and deposited materials resulting from the CS process can influence the integrity of a coating or repair. However, the nature, magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in Ti-64\/Ti-64 CS repairs are currently unknown. This study aims to evaluate the effects of geometrical variables (i.e. the number of CS layers, CS layer thickness, and substrate thickness) and track pattern on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in CS deposit-substrate assemblies. Through-thickness stress distributions were measured experimentally by neutron diffraction and contour method. Furthermore, a comparison among different residual stress build-up mechanisms induced by CS processes has been discussed for different combinations of substrate and deposit assemblies. An analytical model based on the force and moment equilibrium requirements was used to interpret the experimental stress profiles and to predict the residual stress distribution. It was found that residual stresses are highly tensile near the free surface of the Ti-64 deposits as well as towards the bottom of the substrate, and compressive near the interface region. Although all the specimens showed similar stress distribution, the magnitudes were found to be higher in one or more of the following cases: specimens with a higher number of CS layers, lower substrate thickness, higher layer thickness (i.e. at lower scanning speed), and deposited with a horizontal track pattern."

In this study, laser shock peening was applied to a 6-mm-thick middle-crack tension specimen made of aluminium 2524-T351. Residual stress was measured with neutron diffraction and the contour method, along the predicted crack path prior to fatigue testing. Fatigue crack growth test results showed that fatigue life improved by a factor of 4 compared to an untreated component, owing to a significant crack growth rate reduction inside the laser peened area. A linear-elastic finite-element crack growth prediction model was also developed, obtaining predicted results in excellent agreement with the experimental data."

    "abstract": "Modelling the mechanical mixing occurring at the interface of a linear friction weld (LFW) is complex,making it difficult to study the development of residual stresses within real engineering workpieces. To address this, a sequentially couplednumerical model of a Ti-6Al-4V LFW was developed, bypassing the modelling of the oscillations by applying the heat at the weld interface and sequentially removing rows of elements to account for the burn-off. Increasing the rubbing velocity was found to numerically increase the peak of residual stress while narrowing the distribution. Only small changes arose from increasing the applied pressure or changing the oscillation direction. Predictions suggested a strong correlation between the phase 3 temperature profile and the residual stress field subsequently created. Validation against neutron diffraction and contour method are also presented. This approach provides a computationally efficient technique to study the residual stress development within large 3D structures."

The stresses in Ti-6Al-4V wire + arc additively manufactured (WAAM) intersections are lower compared to single pass walls and stresses in continuous walls are larger compared to discontinuous walls with otherwise identical geometry. Thermal stress relief was found to virtually eliminate them. Inter-pass rolling can yield the desired grain refinement, without having any noteworthy influence on the development of residual stresses. The strain measurement itself by neutron diffraction is facilitated by the refined microstructure, because the otherwise textured microstructure produces anisotropic peak intensity, not allowing Pawley refinement. Without rolling, the f1011g and f1013g family of hcp planes are the only ones that diffract consistently in the three principal directions."

The inherent-strain-based method reduces the computational time compared to weakly-coupled thermo-mechanical simulations. Results showed the presence of high tensile residual stresses at and near the surface of both titanium and Inconel alloys samples, whereas compressive residual stresses were seen at the center region.

The magnitude and depth of the compressive residual stress induced by laser peening can be influenced strongly by the number of peen layers (the number of laser hits at each point) and by processing conditions including the use of a protective ablative layer. In this study, residual stresses have been characterized in laser and shot-peened marine butt welds with a particular focus at the fatigue crack initiation location at the weld toe. X-ray diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, incremental center-hole drilling, and the contour method were used for determination of residual stress. Results showed that the use of ablative tape increased the surface compressive stress, and the depth of compressive stress increased with an increase in number of peening layers. A key result is that variation of residual stress profile across laser peen spots was seen, and the residual stress magnitude varies between the center and edges of the spots.Published Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11661-016-3867-y"

In this study, WEDM cutting parameters have been explored to identify the optimum conditions for contour method residual stress measurements. The influence of machine parameters on the surface roughness and cutting artifacts in the contour cut is discussed. It has been identified that the critical parameter in improving the surface finish is the spark pulse duration. A typical cutting artifact and its impact on measured stress values have been identified and demonstrated for a contour cut in a welded marine steel. A procedure is presented to correct contour displacement data from the influence of WEDM cutting artifacts, and is demonstrated on the correction of a measured weld residual stress. The corrected contour method improved the residual stress magnitude up to 150 MPa. The corrected contour method results were validated by X-ray diffraction, incremental center hole drilling, and neutron diffraction."

The welding introduces tensile near-surface residual stress, approaching the material yield strength, and the ultrasonic peening overlays this with a compressive residual stress. Material removal by corrosion decreases the peak surface compressive stress slightly, by removal of a layer of stressed material, but does not cause significant redistribution of the residual stress profile."

It was found that significant relaxation of compressive residual stresses is achieved under application of compressive cycles in fatigue testing. It was also observed that not only the magnitude of the applied compressive stress\/mean stress affects relaxation of the compressive residual stress but also the number of applied compressive cycles. This relaxation may reduce the beneficial effect of HFMI treatment under application of load histories specific to marine structures."

The increase was relatively applied, and the peening also affected the distortion of the specimen after welding."

Three models (Lambertian, Gaussian, and empirical) are utilized to examine the impact of vehicles headlights radiation pattern on the statistical path loss of VVLC system. The analytical model of channel path loss is validated by Monte Carlo simulation with the headlight model simulated with a raytracing software. The path loss values of the Gaussian model differ by 2 dB compared to the Lambertian model, irrespective of the traffic conditions while it differs by 24.6 dB during late night and 8.15 dB during rush hours compared to the empirical model of a Toyota Altis headlight. This variation shows that the radiation intensity distribution should be modelled for each vehicle's headlights from each manufacturer to ensure accurate VVLC channel model. The proposed Gaussian model provides a close approximation to describe such radiation pattern and can easily be adapted to model for different manufacturers' headlights."

    "abstract": "Underwater visible light communication (UVLC) is an attractive solution to achieve high - speed and large -data transmission but challenging due to the impairments induced by absorption, scattering and turbulence. To combat effects of multipath and fading for the UVLC system over turbulence channels, optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O -OFDM) schemes with the transceiver spatial diversity were proposed, which employed equal gain combining (EGC) at the receiver side. Underwater path loss was calculated by a generalized Lambertian formula, and the fading induced by weak turbulence was modelled as a lognormal -distribution random variable. Based on the channel model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the bit error ratio (BER) performance for quadrature - amplitude modulation (QAM) asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO -OFDM) and DC -biased optical OFDM (DCO -OFDM) systems in the channel with and without turbulence was evaluated. Furthermore, the diversity gain was estimated for different diversity orders and scintillation indexes. The results demonstrate that the diversity scheme with EGC is an effective measure to reduce the effect of turbulence and could be useful for designing, predicting, and evaluating the performance of O -OFDM UVLC system in a weak oceanic turbulence condition."

We propose to extend the application of minimax filtering from state estimation in the radio frequency (RF) domain to intruder tracking using VLC. The performance of the proposed method was examined and compared with Kalman filter for both VLC and RF. The simulation results showed that the minimax filter provided marginally better tracking and was more robust to the adversary behavior of the intruder than Kalman filter, with less than 0.5 cm estimation error. In addition, minimax was significantly better than Kalman filter for RF tracking applications."

    "abstract": "The performance of the terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) communication is adversely affected by atmospheric conditions such as fog, rain, dust particles, and smoke. Even in clear atmospheric conditions, the FSO link experiences severe fading due to the turbulence effect. Turbulence is induced by random variations in refractive index due to temperature and pressure fluctuations along the FSO beam propagation. Turbulence can introduce deep fading (20 to 30 dB); as a result, the outage probability increases significantly. In order to mitigate the channel fading, the receiver or transmitter diversities or a combined transmitter and receiver diversity (known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques) are often considered along with other techniques such as modulation, temporal and wavelength diversities. In this chapter, the FSO link performance in the presence of the turbulence fading using transmitter and receiver diversity is discussed."

Due to the lack of a realistic channel model that takes the vehicles mobility and the light propagation nature into consideration, we propose a regular-shaped geometry based stochastic channel model (RSGBSM). Particularly, we suggest the ellipse shape to describe the line of sight (LOS) and the reflection components of the VVLC. This approach offers flexibility to describe vehicles locations, speed and direction as well as stationary and non-stationary reflectors which are changing rapidly and continuously. The simulation results demonstrate that the LOS channel component is more affected by the direction of motion than the reflection component, whereas the reflection component is more affected by the relative speed of the vehicles."

In this paper,  an investigation on scattering regimes for underwater links using Monte Carlo simulation has been presented.While the focus of this paper is on diffuse links, the simulation results of collimated links is also provided for comparison purpose. Three types of water namely clear, coastal and turbid water are being used in the simulation. It is shown that the effect of scattering on the path loss cannot be accurately modeled by the existing channel model; ie. Beers-Lambert (BL) law.  It has been shown that  the distance at which the unscattered light drops to zero can be used to estimate the transition point for the scattering regimes in case of diffuse links. The transition point for diffuse links in coastal water and turbid water can be estimated to be around 22 m and 4 m respectively. Further analysis on the scattering order probability at different scattering regimes illustrates how scattering is affected by beam size, water turbidity and distance. From the frequency response plot, it is estimated that the bandwidth of several order of GHz can be achieved when the links are operating in the minimal scattering region and will reduce to several hundreds of MHz when the link is operating in multiple scattering region."

Future transport is expected to be dominated by self-driving and autonomous vehicles. Our extensive studies on user adoption indicates that acceptance will be determined mainly by these concerns. In this paper, we investigated user adoption and acceptance of self-driving vehicles. Our study demonstrated that the future adoption of self-driving vehicles will be affected by several inherent concerns such as security, privacy, and trust by the public. Nevertheless, the results of our review revealed that the field of self-driving vehicles will continue to generate interest due to its impact on transport and mobility. Predicting user adoption of self-driving vehicles is a novel research subject which has recently begun to gather momentum; however, predictive accuracy remains a challenge using simple statistical methods. Machine learning modelling techniques can provide better understanding of data and non-linear relationships between decision variables. From our data, we were able to predict self-driving acceptance based on user preference and inherent concerns. We applied supervised learning algorithms namely, Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, and Fuzzy Logic to predict user adoption of self-driving vehicles. We used 6 independent variables namely safety, trust, security, ethics, cost, and privacy. We evaluated each algorithm by using 5-fold cross validation technique. The algorithms were compared based on 3 outcomes: accuracy, precision and recall. Fuzzy logic was found to outperform other algorithms followed by random forest while Na\u00efve Bayes performed lower."

Effort was made to use all available means within reach and are close to works on restoration of gait control with emphasis on the lower limbs. FES can be applied alone (pure), but for walking or other active exercise it is usually combined with orthosis (hybrid). Nature of the plant which is a combination of the nervous, muscular and skeletal (neural-muscular-skeletal) systems as well as of limitations in sensor availability made the linear approach not favorable to such systems. Intelligent strategies most likely could provide clinically acceptable solutions, but are likely to face stability issues which are serious concern in this scenario, other shortcomings include longer tuning duration, re-tuning for different subjects and involvement of high computation. Stability issues can be dealt with directly when nonlinear techniques are used and also periodic utterances can be handled with relative ease. Nonlinear control techniques share the shortcoming of high computational requirement and at times complexity problems with the intelligent schemes, but kudos to achievements in microprocessor technologies that always yields higher capability processors which could eradicate issue. Hence, exploring the nonlinear technique could provide solution which could pave way for making countless things easy.

Then, it was applied to finite element analysis of energy piles\u2019heat transfer efficiency. The numerical results reveal that ignoring stress effects on thermal conductivity, as in the conventional analysis, underestimates the heat exchange rate between energy piles and ground. The underestimation is more significant for piles with a larger aspect ratio and a faster pipe flow velocity, especially when the ground is drier and more compressible. For example, when the pile is 0.6 m in diameter and 50 in aspect ratio, the underestimation is up to 18%, 15% and 4% for the clay, silt and sand, respectively. These resultssuggest that stress effects on thermal conductivity should be considered for better assessing the heat transfer efficiency of energy piles and other thermal geostructures."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Lateritic soil covers about 15% of the area in the world and is extensively used as fill materials in various applications, such as back-filling materials for retaining structures and pavements. Lateritic soil is uniquely recognized for its rich composition in oxides of iron and aluminium (sesquioxide), which enhance the formation of soil aggregates. The responses of these aggregates under hydro-mechanical loading can significantly affect the volume change and shear strength of the soil. Lateritic soil is less studied, andthere has been limited laboratory data reported in literature to explicitly illustrate how suction affects its shear strength and dilatancy.Therefore, a good understanding of their hydro-mechanical behaviour is required because it can improve the designs of civil engineering structures built on lateritic soils. In this paper, a series of laboratory tests on a compacted lateritic sandy clay (LAT) were carried out in a suction-controlled triaxial apparatus. Three different suctions (0, 50 and 150 kPa) were considered. Each specimen was wetted from initial suction of 150 kPa to the desired suction before isotropic consolidation and constant suction shearing. During shear, each specimen was subjected to a constant net stress and suction. Effects of soil suction on the evolution of dilatancy, stress dilatancy relationship and maximum dilatancy will be reported and discussed in this paper."

However, despite these developments, the accuracy, range and duration of HCT-based measurement is still largely characterized by uncertainties and inconsistencies, thereby, reducing the reliability of the obtained SWRCs. In this work, an experimental program is designed to address these uncertainties. SWRCs of reconstituted London clay were measured using the continuous drying method with evaporation rate control. The obtained SWRCs were analysed based on the maximum suction value recorded by HCTs (smax), the obtained air-entry value (saev), the suction at inflection point (si), the water content at inflection point (wi), and the slope of tangent to inflection point (mi). A percentage uncertainty of \u00b14% was obtained for the saev and si values. Similarly, percentage uncertainties of \u00b16% and \u00b10.5% were obtained respectively for the mi and wi values. These results were further compared with parametric analysis of the reported SWRCs of the same soil in the literature. Given the observed tolerance ranges, cautions must be taken in selecting values for these parameters e.g. as input values in mathematical curve fitting equations for prediction of the entire SWRC, or in unsaturated constitutive modelling, to enhance reliability of the outputs."

The influence of these minerals on the thermo-mechanical soil behaviour, however, has not been well understood. In this study, cyclic thermal strain of a small number of specimens of saturated lateritic clay was investigated over a temperature range of 5 to 70 \u00b0C, using a thermal oedometer equipped with an invar ring. Both compacted and reconstituted specimens, which were expected to have different degrees of aggregation, were tested. The soil was characterised in terms of its mineralogy and microstructure determined respectively using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that a semi-empirical equation over-estimated the thermal expansion coefficient of normally consolidated (NC) lateritic clay by about 3 times. The discrepancy is mainly because the goethite and hematite in the lateritic clay enhance the formation of aggregates and stiffen the specimen. Even the reconstituted specimen contains many aggregates, as clearly revealed by the result SEM tests. Goethite and hematite have much lower thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) than many clay minerals. On the other hand, it was found that both NC compacted and reconstituted specimens showed an accumulation of irreversible contraction under cyclic heating and cooling, but at a decreasing rate, where for a given number of thermal cycles, the measured thermal strain of NC reconstituted specimens was about 30% lower than that of the NC compacted specimens. This is mainly because the density of NC reconstituted specimen is much higher than the NC compacted specimen, even though they had experienced the same effective stress."

Compared to other soils, it is rich in iron and aluminum oxides (sesquioxides), which enhance the formation of soil aggregates. The principal objective of this study is to investigate the hydromechanical behaviour of a lateritic sandy lean clay. All specimens were compacted at the same condition and then wetted to a predefined suction (0, 50, 150 kPa). Suction-controlled isotropic compression and shear tests were carried out. Moreover, soil microstructures at various suctions were determined using the mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The compressibility of the lateritic clay decreased by about 50% as suction decreased from 150 to 0 kPa. This is mainly because as the suction decreased to 0 kPa, the sizes of interaggregate pores decreased, as revealed by MIP data. During shearing, the critical state friction angle appeared to be independent of suction. The contribution of suction to the apparent cohesion is unexpectedly low, likely because the interaggregate pores have a low degree of saturation and the contribution of the water meniscus on shear strength is very low."

    "abstract": "Lateritic clay is well recognized to contain significant amount of iron and aluminium oxides (sesquioxide). These oxides enhance the formation of soil aggregates which would greatly affect soil structure. So far, no study has been carried out purposely to investigate the influence of aggregate-dependent structure on the mechanical behaviour of the lateritic clay. In this study, structure effects on the compression and shear behaviour of a saturated lateritic clay were studied. Intact, recompacted and reconstituted specimens were studied through oedometer, isotropic compression and consolidated undrained shear tests. Microstructure of these specimens was determined using the mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques and then used to explain the observed behaviour. It was found that the compressibility of recompacted\/reconstituted specimens was about 90% larger than intact specimen. Different from soft clay, the influence of microstructure does not show an obvious reduction in compressibility after yielding. The peak shear strength of intact specimen was about 100% higher than those of reconstituted\/recompacted specimens. The significant difference in compression and shear behaviour is mainly because the aggregates of intact specimen were about 90% larger than those of reconstituted\/recompacted specimens, as revealed by the SEM results. As a result, particle contacts forming the force chain were therefore larger in the intact specimen. The intact specimen therefore became less compressible and more dilative."

    "abstract": "Lateritic soil is rich in oxides of iron and aluminum (sesquioxide). The effects of these oxides on its mechanical behaviour are not well-understood. In this study, the compression and shear behaviour of a lateritic (LAT) soil was tested and compared to those of two other weathered granitic and volcanic soils (CDG and CDV) for the first time within the critical state framework. The mineralogy, chemical compositions and microstructure of these three soils were also measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. It is found that only LAT contains goethite, while other minerals are similar in all the soils. The content of iron and aluminum oxides in LAT is about 40% higher than that in CDV and CDG. LAT is found to be less compressible than CDV and CDG by 18% and 36% respectively, even though the former has a higher clay content than the latter two soils. The lowest compressibility of LAT is mainly attributed to its high content of sesquioxide, which induces the formation of more aggregates. The LAT has more intra-aggregate pores and hence less inter-aggregate pores than CDV and CDG. A smaller volume of inter-aggregate pores of LAT results in a lower compressibility. It is found that the critical state friction angles of LAT, CDV and CDG are 42\u00b0, 33\u00b0 and 38\u00b0, respectively. The highest friction angle of LAT is likely attributed to the content of large particles and presence of goethite. Due to the high sesquioxide contents of LAT, many clay fines also form large aggregates leading to a more granular microstructure. Consequently, the number of particle contacts is increased and therefore enhancing particle interlocking. Goethite mineral found in LAT could enhance inter-aggregate interlocking through its contiguous singly coordinated OH groups."

In order for a material to act as stabilizer, its impact on soil settlement characteristics must be investigated. Hence, this research investigated the influence of bone ash stabilizer on the settlement characteristics of soil. Two soil samples were collected from two locations within Ibadan metropolis Nigeria. Bone ash was prepared from calcination of cattle bones at a temperature of 1100\u00c2C in electric furnace. After grinding, the ash was added to the collected soil samples in varying proportions by dry weight (3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15% and 20%) in order to determine the compressibility behaviour of the soil at different proportions of bone ash. The settlement characteristics investigated were compression index, coefficient of consolidation, preconsolidation pressure, coefficient of area and volume compressibility and initial void ratio of both control soils and twenty four stabilized soil samples. The result revealed that Soils A and B coefficient of volume and area compressibility, and compressibility index reached their lowest level at 7 and 10% stabilization which is good for engineering. The soils pre-consolidation pressure and coefficient of consolidation reached peak values at 7 and 10% bone ash stabilization. Therefore, addition of about 7 to 10% of bone ash to the soils will reduce their settlement potential and increase their stability."

Islamic financial market\u2019s (IFM) instruments use different stress testing and liquidity risk approaches due to considerations relating to their regional, regulatory, legal, product and operational requirements that may dictate a certain approach and stress scenarios to manage the associated risks and test their ability to absorb market shocks. This chapter provides in-depth insights into the best market practices for stress testing framework for the survival of Islamic financial markets and institutions in the face of possible market shocks, within a sophisticated financial market in Europe. This subject is important for two reasons: firstly, the survival of an Islamic financial market and its institutions is hugely dependent on its risk factors and stress testing management approaches. Secondly, the ability of managing such market shocks without compromising Shari\u2019ah requirements is a very important component for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). The study collects its data by using the method of a case study to obtain in-depth knowledge from the Bank of England and IFIs in the UK. The findings of the study identify key stress testing steps and assessment in addition to risks that are crucial for the survival of the IFM and its institutions. It also suggests a stress testing approach that could reduce the impact of financial shocks to the IFM and ensure its resilience."

Building on research done previously and data from an original survey, the paper carries out a principal descriptive analysis (PDA) to construct the main dimensions on which financial consumer agents diverge. Five key components emerged from the PDA that is interpreted with the help of a survey covering different types of consumers. Furthermore, it explores the perceived association of Islamic financial values with ethical norms in the West. The findings help us understand how IF has been conceptualised by consumers in non-Muslim majority markets. The five components identified shed light on the constructs that have informed the growth of IF as an ethical option in international non-Muslim majority markets. This advocates the view that IF should be characterised by multidimensional drivers in the global financial market, rather than a single component of religious values."

This is possible by assessing the impact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) in mitigating disease exposure. This study aims to assess the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 exposure in closed environments. This is achieved by proposing an innovative COVID-19 exposure prediction framework. The developed framework consists of three modules: Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach, Clustering Module (CM), and Decision Tree (DT) technique. The framework also integrates these modules considering the exposure time factor to identify the level of exposure to COVID-19 in closed environments. A supermarket based in Jordan is considered a case study to test the applicability of the proposed framework in predicting exposure levels and numbers. The impact of Individual and combined NPIs application in closed environment facilities is assessed based on the exposure level and other OIs such as opening time, body temperature measurement, and the number of people inside the supermarket. Key results show that wearing Mask, Face Shield and leaving Social Distance guarantees no exposure to COVID-19 and increases the safety level to 61.9% in a closed environment such as supermarkets with a potential exposure rate of up to 28.5% if otherwise."

    "abstract": "There has been a rise of use of Autonomous Vehicles on public roads. With the predicted rise of road traffic accidents over the coming years, these vehicles must be capable of safely operate in the public domain. The field of pedestrian detection has significantly advanced in the last decade, providing high-level accuracy, with some technique reaching near-human level accuracy. However, there remains further work required for pedestrian intent prediction to reach human-level performance. One of the challenges facing current pedestrian intent predictors are the varying scales of pedestrians, particularly smaller pedestrians. This is because smaller pedestrians can blend into the background, making them difficult to detect, track or apply pose estimations techniques. Therefore, in this work, we present a novel intent prediction approach for multi-scale pedestrians using 2D pose estimation and a Long-short term memory (LSTM) architecture. The pose estimator predicts keypoints for the pedestrian along the video frames. Based on the accumulation of these keypoints along the frames, spatio-temporal data is generated. This spatio-temporal data is fed to the LSTM for classifying the crossing behaviour of the pedestrians. We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques on the popular Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset and the new larger-scale Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) dataset. Using data generalisation techniques, we show that the proposed technique outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques by up to 7%, reaching up to 94% accuracy while maintaining a comparable run-time of 6.1 ms."

In this paper, agent-based modelling integrated with heuristic optimisation approach is presented as embedded within a scheduling and rescheduling framework. The proposed approach is implemented in a disrupted OEMs parts manufacturing system. The integration of the framework modules in connection with inventory control helped production planners to manage disruptions by tracking order processing times and quantities and for performance measurement. The proposed approach is compared with the few existing related methods like the sequential method. The proposed approach not only revealed the impact of disruptions in terms of process times and order quantities but offered 'available times' which were applied for production support and inventory replenishment. This demonstrates a valuable and viable resolution strategy responding and adapting to disruptions caused by customers."

In order to tackle this problem, a new agent-based metaheuristic architecture is proposed to capture the uniqueness of vehicles by modelling them as agents while governing the search with centralised agent cooperation. This cooperation aims to generate near optimum routes by minimising the number of vehicles used, total travelled distance, and total waiting times. The innovative architecture encapsulates three individual core modules in a flexible metaheuristic implementation. First, the problem is modelled by an agent-based module that includes its components in representing, evaluating, and altering solutions. A second metaheuristic module is then designed and integrated, followed by a multi-objective module introduced to sort solutions generated by the metaheuristic module based on Pareto dominance. Tests on benchmark instances were run, resulting in better waiting times, with an average reduction of 2.21-time units, at the expense of the other objectives. Benchmark instances are modified to tackle the unique vehicle\u2019s problem by randomising locations, capacities, and operating shifts and tested to justify the proposed model\u2019s applicability."

    "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely used to determine future demand for power in the short, medium, and long terms. However, research has identified that\u00a0ANNs could cause inaccurate predictions of load when used for long-term forecasting. This inaccuracy is attributed to insufficient training data and increased accumulated errors, especially in long-term estimations. This study develops an improved ANN model with an Adaptive Backpropagation Algorithm (ABPA) for best practice in the\u00a0forecasting long-term load demand of electricity. The ABPA includes proposing new forecasting formulations that adjust\/adapt forecast values, so it\u00a0takes into consideration the deviation between trained and future input datasets' different behaviours. The architecture of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, along with its traditional Backpropagation Algorithm (BPA), is used as a baseline for the proposed development. The forecasting formula is further improved by introducing adjustment factors to smooth out behavioural differences between the trained and new\/future datasets. A computational study based on actual monthly electricity consumption inputs from 2011 to 2020, provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity, is conducted to verify the proposed adaptive algorithm's performance. Different types of energy consumption and the electricity cut period (unsatisfied demand) factor are also considered in this study as vital factors. The developed ANN model, including its proposed ABPA, is then compared with traditional and popular prediction techniques such as regression and other advanced machine learning approaches, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to justify its superiority amongst them. The results reveal that the most accurate long-term forecasts with the minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values of (1.195.650) and (0.045), respectively, are successfully achieved by applying the proposed ABPA. It can be concluded that the proposed ABPA, including the adjustment factor, enables traditional ANN techniques to be efficiently used for long-term forecasting of electricity load demand."

    "abstract": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well studied logistical problem along with its various variants such as VRP with customer Time-Window (VRPTW). However, all the previously studied variants assume that vehicles are mostly the same in terms of their capacity, location and home location (depot). This study uses the agent-based approach for solving VRPTW with vehicle's unique location and depot. This is to minimise the number of used vehicles as the main target. Other targets including total distance travelled, waiting time and time are also considered as criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated vehicle routes. This is achieved by proposing a Messaging Protocol-based Heuristics Optimisation (MPHO) model that balances between centrally-distributed agents' interactions and accommodates certain priority rules specifically developed for the problem. Furthermore, modifications to certain constraints checking techniques are introduced by implementing time Push Forward (PF) checking recursively tailored to the route's unique start\/ending locations as well as calculating the reduced waiting time to find and check the limit of the total route duration. In order to justify the superiority of the proposed MPHO model, numerical tests have been conducted on benchmark problems including single and multiple depot instances as well as modified instances tailored to the problem. This is made possible by randomising vehicles' capacities and their unique locations and depots. Key results reveal that, in multiple depot instances, higher quality solutions compared with previous benchmark outcomes are obtained in terms of minimising the total number of vehicles along with fastest solution time (CPU) at the expense of total time and distance travelled."

In many utilities, transformers have been operating for many years past their expected usable life. As power demand has surged, transformers in some areas are being loaded beyond their rated capacity to meet the demand. One of the vital components in a transformer is the on-load tap changer (OLTC), which regulates the voltage in the distribution network. This study aims to review several condition-monitoring techniques (online and offline) that can monitor the health of the OLTC and assure the safety of the transformer\u2019s OLTC from irreparable damage by detecting the defect at an earlier stage, which is preceded by the specification of typical faults. This paper also discussed the common faults of the OLTC and the root causes of these faults. The OLTC is prone to mechanical faults due to its frequently changing mechanism in the tap operation. The OLTC are also prone to oil as well as thermal faults. As a result, it is critical to monitor OLTC conditions while they are in use. Proper management of condition monitoring (CM) for the OLTC is useful and necessary to increase availability and achieve optimised operating. Condition monitoring (CM) and diagnostics methods (DM) have been developing since the 1950s. CM and DM have been implemented to diagnose and detect an incipient fault, especially for the OLTC. Many techniques, online and offline, are being used to monitor the condition of the OLTC to prevent failure and minimize outages. These DM and CM will prolong the operational cycle and avoid a major disaster for the OLTC, which is an unfavorable scenario."

The number of infections was affected by the application of the facemask. Infections were reduced when facemask adherence and social distancing were applied. The study showed that the application of social distancing has a similar effect to a 20% adherence of agents wearing a facemask. The model also reveals that more agents adhere to the facemask, and the time required to get an agent to the state exposed increases.

In addition, different speed intervals, which include 1000 RPM, 2000 RPM, and 5000 RPM, are employed for each fuel blend. The production of four major emissions, NOx, CO, CO2, and HC, and performance parameters such as thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, and brake-specific fuel consumption, are evaluated using SolidWorks for CAD modelling. This then is transferred to ANSYS for emission and performance analysis. According to the findings, increasing ethanol concentration and engine speed increases volumetric efficiency and brake-specific fuel consumption by up to 12.89% and 6.59%, respectively. It was also discovered that ethanol and increasing engine speed had an 11.39% reduction in thermal efficiency.

This phenomenon is known as the spontaneous combustion of coal. It is a complex process that has non-linear relationships between its causing variables. Preventive measures to prevent the fire from spreading to other coal piles in the vicinity have already been implemented. However, the predictive aspect before the fire occurs is of great necessity for thepower generation sector. This research investigates various prediction models for spontaneous coal combustion, explicitly selecting input and output parameters to identify a proper clinker formation prediction model. Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is proposed as a proper prediction model. Two Hidden Layers (2HL) network is found to be the best with 5 minutes prediction capability. A sensitivity analysis study is also conducted to determine the influence of random input variables ontheir respective response variables."

    "abstract": "Recent work on the management of renewable energy sources focuses on developing innovative tools and techniques to control the different behaviours of energy generation systems (eg, the intermittent production of wind power). These tools contribute to achieving a proper balance between energy supply and consumer demand and guarantee a sustainable energy level in storage devices that can face potential generation shortages. In contrast, previous studies mainly focused on stimulating consumer response to market prices so as to rationalise consumption, especially during peak periods. This study investigates the impact of supplier decisions about using different renewable energy sources on the distribution planning and control of energy for the best consumer demand satisfaction and achieving a sustainable energy level in different located storage devices. A Multi Agent-Based Heuristic Optimisation model is developed to deliver this aim. The heuristic optimisation part of this model is proposed to optimise the energy level across differently located storage devices. It also guarantees the best energy exchange between regions at the strategic planning level. A sensitivity analysis study is conducted to verify the behaviour of the proposed model towards various demand levels, followed by a comparison study to justify the proposed agent-based heuristic model's superiority. The results highlight the impact of using intermittent renewable sources including solar, wind, hydro and storage devices on energy production, control and distribution. In addition, a sustainable level of storage in devices placed at different locations is achieved by optimising the energy storage operation. This sustainable storage aids any insufficient energy generated from intermittent sources to satisfy consumer requirements. The best energy exchange between regions is also presented."

    "abstract": "Managing the container yard operations can be challenging as a result of various uncertainties associated with storing and retrieving containers from the yard. These associated uncertainties occur because the arrival of a truck to pick up the container is random, so the departure time of the container is unknown. The problem investigated in this paper emerges when newly arrived containers of different sizes, types and weights require storage operation in the same yard where other containers have already been stored. This situation becomes more challenging when the time of departure of existing container is not known. This study develops a new Fuzzy Knowledge-Based optimisation system named \u2018FKB_GA\u2019 for optimal storage and retrieval of containers in a yard that contains long stay pre-existing containers. The containers\u2019 duration of stay factor is considered along with two other factors such as the similarity (containers with same customer) and the quantity of containers per stack.A new Multi-Layered Genetic Algorithm module is proposed which identifies the optimal fuzzy rules required for each set of fired rules to achieve a minimum number of container re-handlings when selecting a stack. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the developed system."

Therefore, efficient power plant management is required to increase the power plant\u2019s operational efficiency. Conventional optimisation tools in power plants are not reliable as it is challenging to monitor, model and analyse individual and combined components within power systems in a plant. However, intelligent computational tools such as artificial neural networks (ANN), nature-inspired computations and meta-heuristics are becoming more reliable, offering a better understanding of the behaviour of the power systems, which eventually leads to better energy efficiency. This paper aims to provide an overview of the development and application of intelligent computational tools such as ANN in managing power plants. Also, to present several applications of intelligent computational tools in power plants operations management. The literature review technique is used to demonstrate intelligent computational tools in various power plants applications.

However, their low thermal efficiency may make the continuous baseload operations a lossmaking alternative and threaten to continue. This fact is raising the importance of performing thermodynamic investigation according to the current operations\u2019 conditions. This paper aims to conduct a thermodynamic investigation for two Siemens V94.2 gas turbine (GT) units based on current operations\u2019 conditions. The reason for selecting these units is because they are operating at a much lower thermal efficiency than the designed thermal efficiency, and due to the age factor, the GTs are not suitable for major retrofitting due to poor return on investments. A numerical model is designed to simulate the overall thermodynamic process in the gas turbine using MATLAB SIMULINK.The obtained numerical results are validated by comparing them with the operational data collected from the stations. The thermal efficiency is increased by 30%, with a maximum output power equal to 140MW. The power output had decreased by 0.2% when the ambient temperature was increased carried out to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency and power output. Finally, a number of recommendations are made to address decreased thermal efficiency and output power."

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy linear programming model and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to maximize the overall revenue of a large-scale multi-leg flight network by minimizing the number of empty seats and the number of denied passengers.A fuzzy logic technique is used for modeling the fuzzy demand on overbooking flight tickets and a metaheuristics-based GA technique is adopted to solve large-scale multi-leg flights problem.As part of model verification, the proposed GA is applied to solve a small multi-leg flight linear programming model with a fuzzified demand factor.

The concept of agent and agent functions can help to automate a variety of difficult tasks and assist decision-making in flow-shop production. This is especially so in the large-scale Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) industry, which is associated with many uncertainties. Among these are uncertainties in customer demand requirements that create disruptions that impact production planning and scheduling, hence, making it difficult to satisfy demand in due time, in the right order delivery sequence, and in the right item quantities. It is however important to devise means of adapting to these inevitable disruptive problems by accommodating them while minimising the impact on production performance and customer satisfaction.In this paper, an innovative embedded agent-based Production Disruption Inventory-Replenishment (PDIR) framework, which includes a novel adaptive heuristic algorithm and inventory replenishment strategy which is proposed to tackle the disruption problems. The capabilities and functionalities of agents are utilised to simulate the flow-shop production environment and aid learning and decision making. In practice, the proposed approach is implemented through a set of experiments conducted as a case study of an automobile parts facility for a real-life large-scale OEM. The results are presented in term of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as the number of late\/unsatisfied orders, to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal a minimum number of late\/unsatisfied orders, when compared with other approaches."

The main challenge is when containers of a different size, type, or weight need to be stored in a yard that holds a number of pre-existing containers. This challenge becomes even more complex when the date and time for the departure of the containers are unknown, as is the case when the container is collected by a third-party logistics company without any prior notice being given. The aim of this study is to develop a new system for the management of container yard operationsthat takes into consideration a number of factors and constraints that occur in a real-life situation. One of these factors is the duration of stay for the topmost containers of each stack, when the containers are stored. Because theduration of stay for containers in a yard varies dynamically over time, an \u2018ON\/OFF\u2019 strategy is proposed to activate\/deactivate the duration of stay factor constraint if the length of stay for these containers varies signi\ufb01cantly overtime. A number of tools and techniques are utilised for developing the proposed system including: discrete event simulation for the modelling of container storage and retrieval operations, a fuzzy know ledge-based model forthe stack allocation of containers, and a heuristic algorithm called \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 for the container retrieval operation. Results show that by adopting the proposed \u2018ON\/OFF\u2019 strategy, 5% of the number of re-handlings, 2.5% of the total retrieval time, 6.6% of the total re-handling time and42% of the average waiting time per truck are reduced."

    "abstract": "Overbooking is an important revenue management strategy that is currently used in many industries including airline industry. Briefly, overbooking lets airlines to mitigate the risk of flying with empty seats. However, identifying an overbooking level is a complicated task due to the uncertainties associated with the external factors that affect the booking process fundamentally. There have been many methods proposed for overbooking problem on a single-leg flight, yet few studies have been conducted on airline networks. Although, overbooking problem can be handled at the single-leg level in practice, considering the problem as a network revenue management problem can be more profitable for the airlines due to the fact that seat allocation in one leg affects other legs in the network. In this paper, a fuzzy linear programming model is proposed for the overbooking optimisation problem in multi-leg flights with multiple fare-classes. Unlike the majority of the previous studies, the uncertainties related to demand are addressed by defining the demand as fuzzy numbers. Our main aim is to propose an optimisation method that maximises the overall revenue of the flight network by minimising the number of empty seats and the number of denied passengers. Moreover, we strive to show that the proposed model can be used as a decision support tool by the airline revenue management analysts or the decision makers to assist the process of determining booking limits for different flights in airline networks. We expect to test the proposed method for different scenarios and upon successful completion of this research we will investigate the advantages of using fuzzy theory in airline network overbooking problem."

    "abstract": "Competition in the automotive industry is becoming more intense, the product life cycle is getting shorter and there is an increasing demand of customization. High product variety along with faster new product introduction may result in an inefficiency in production. In order to be responsive to the market requirements, maximising the production rate is essential.At one of the vehicle manufacturers in the UK, the current sub-assembly process of tailgates, where tailgates are lifted by carriers, assembled then fed to the main assembly line to be fitted to their matched vehicles, is facing problem of occasional starvations of empty carriers when they return from the fitting point. This problem flags a concern of stopping the main line and as a consequence, slowing down the production.In order to solve this problem, a flow diagram is developed to represent the logic of the process. Discrete-event simulation approach is used to mimic operations of the sub-assembly line. A simulation model is then developed to identify the bottleneck(s), determine whether or not additional carriers are required and design scenarios for improving the process, taking into consideration random failures in the main line.The results show that starvations are caused due to the main line failures, which lead to high buffer levels of carriers lifting tailgates within the sub-assembly process. This leads to less empty carriers remaining for a new assembly cycle. A slight improvement of 1.2% in production speed could be achieved by reducing the bottleneck time by 15 seconds and less than 1% improvement if five more carriers are added."

The main aim of the project is to design and develop a capacity simulator model based on spreadsheet tools. This model will enable parallel processing of orders when simulating shop floors and it is based on discrete event simulation methodology. The key objective is to model the logic of shop floor operations and the logic parallel simulation; mimicking real life shop floor operations which will help towards creating the capacity calculator simulator. Flowchart will be used to model logical operations on shop floors as well as the logic of the parallel simulation algorithm. In addition, UML diagrams representing entities, data and attributes in the shop floor will be used. The developed simulation is established via spreadsheet tools with scripted VBA Macro codes. Verification and validation techniques have been applied through results analysis of tested case study scenarios, which will provide the justification of the developed model. The expected outputs will show a reduction in the total production, queue times and increment in resource utilisations of the shop floor being investigated. The status of whether or not orders have been produced on time will be displayed."

    "abstract": "It is essential to cut costs and increase revenue wherever is possible in an airline business. To increase revenue, revenue management (yield management) is used in airline industry to maximise the profit through seven elements; customer behaviour and demand forecasting, control system, revenue factors, variable cost factors, fare products, problem scale, and problem interfaces. In control system, one factor is the overbooking concept which is selling tickets over the capacity to increase capacity utilisation in case of no-show probability of ticketed passengers. However, risks are involved when implementing an overbooking strategy. The main risk is that it is unknown how many passengers will show up or not at the time of departure for the flight. If the number of passengers show up for the flight exceeds the capacity, the airline has to deny passengers and have to compensate the denied passengers which will incur as a cost, decreasing the profit. It has been noted that most of the previous works used estimation or random probability on deciding the number of go-show or no-show passengers. This is impractical as in most cases there is no defined\/known probabilistic behaviour that could model most of the aspects of oversold tickets problems. The aim of this research is to solve overbooking problem in the airline industry to maximize revenue using mathematical models based on fuzzy optimisation. This will assist in deciding how many overbooks are optimal per single-leg flight."

This motivates top management of the industries to investigate the possibility of adopting sophisticated IT technologies in order to continuously improve their performance.In order to gain full understanding of how the powder coating system of a manufacturing company works and how component parts and resources interact, two conceptual modelling techniques were used, IDEF0 and flowchart. An \u201cAs Is\u201d simulation model was developed for the entire system using ARENA simulation package. Various key performance indicators are considered such as the average time the component parts spend waiting for the resource and the average number of waiting parts.The model was verified with the aid of Arena inbuilt functions as well as 3D modelling of the system using the Arena visual designer. The experimental design consisted of four scenarios. The results obtained from one of the scenarios showed significant improvement of both utilisation of the unloading resource and waiting time of parts."

However, the adoption of new technology in the construction of buildings requires intense study of the influential factors that can affect the demand for new buildings. This research investigates the factors which have significant impact on demand for fibre cement technology. On the basis of questionnaire data analysis, this research process developed a model of system dynamics which showed the relationships between influential factors and demand, as well as finding new relationships between these factors. After modelling the factors of cost, advertising, education and awareness, the availability of classic buildings and specifications of fibre cement buildings are shown to be important factors in affecting demand for fibre cement buildings and vice versa. \nOn the other hand, factors such as population, number of couples in households, availability of building land and standard of living have an important effect on demand, while demand has no impact on these factors. Therefore, these influential factors can help construction companies and contractors to enhance the demand for their newly developed buildings. Fibre cement buildings are cheap, attractive and resistant to fire and humidity, can be assembled, disassembled and then reassembled. These features can play an important role in attracting and satisfying customers for such buildings."

The aim of this study is to develop an innovative crew allocation system that can efficiently allocate crews of workers to labour-intensive repetitive processes. The objective is to improve off-site precast production operations using multi-layered genetic algorithms (GAs). The multi-layered concept emerged in response to the requirement of modelling different sets of labour inputs. As part of the techniques used in developing a crew allocation \u2018SIM_Crew\u2019 system, a process mapping methodology is used to model processes of precast concrete operations and to provide the framework and input required for simulation. Process simulation is then used to model and imitate all production processes and GAs are embedded within the simulation model to provide a rapid and intelligent search. A multi-layered chromosome is used to store different sets of inputs such as crews working on different shifts and process priorities. The results illustrate that adopting different combinations of crews of workers has a substantial impact on the labour allocation cost and this should lead to increased efficiency and lower production cost. In addition, the results of the simulation show that reduced throughput and process-waiting times and improved resource utilisation profiles can be achieved when compared with a real-life case study."

Most systems consist of a multi-hole differential pressure sensor or a rotating vane sensor for estimation of AOA, some also require additional data from an Air Data Computer. This paper examines an alternative method for multi-point AOA sensing using COTS MEMS pressure transducers. The method employed multiple chord-wise sensors to measure local pressure and this was used to estimate local AOA for improved stall awareness. The results suggest that the multi-point method is feasible for AOA sensing and can provide local stall warning relative to a local chord airfoil. Expanding the system to span-wise has the potential to improve total stall awareness."

    "abstract": "Many aircraft design software packages are available in the market. Some of them are intended for preliminary design phase. These packages investigate the aircraft stability and controllability through the stability model to get the dimensional and non-dimensional derivatives. For students and fresh engineers, these derivatives are ambiguous and do not give a well-defined consideration about the influence of the control surface sizing on them.Therefore, adding the control surface model to preliminary software will assist, enhance, and improve students' knowledge, sympathy, and investigating studies. This paper presents the control surface model for use in preliminary aircraft design software. The model consists of three sub-models. Each sub-model is involved to perform the sizing of one of the primary conventional control surfaces. The aileron represents the first sub-model. The elevator represents the second sub-model, while the rudder represents the third sub-model. A flowchart for each sub-model is provided."

    "abstract": "Fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy in the reactants into the electrical energy after steps of sequential electrochemical processes with no significant impact on the environment. For high altitude long endurance (HALE) of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) where fuel cell operates as a prime source of power, the operation and performance of a PEM fuel cell at different level of altitudes is vitally important. In this paper, the impact of direct using extracted air from high altitudes atmosphere in order to feed the stack is investigated, and the governing equations of the supplied air and oxygen to the PEM fuel cell stack are developed. The impact of high altitudes upon the operation and the consumption of air are determined in order to maintain certain level of delivered power to the load. Also the implications associated with operating the PEM fuel cell stack at high altitudes and different technical solutions are proposed. Various modes of Integral, Proportional-Integral, and Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller are introduced and examined for different time setting responses in order to determine the most adequate trade-off choice between fast response and reactants consumption which provides the necessary optimization of the air consumption for the developed model of PEM fuel cell used for UAS operation."

By this stage, the students have acquired basic skills in the fundamental aeronautical science.

The  operating  costs  are classified into two categories which are direct operating cost (DOC) and indirect operating cost (IOC). IOC is difficult to estimate well, since it depends on the services that the airline (customer)offered, and can vary considerably between operators. Therefore, DOC is useful and widely-used parameter  for  comparative  analysis.  Many  methodologies  have  been  developed  to  estimate DOC.  There  are  three  common  methodologies  that  are  in  use  in  preliminary  aircraft  design.These  models,  namely  the  ATA,  NASA  and  the  AEA  form  the  basis  of  cost  estimation.

Examining and analysing OCV under different operational temperature and pressure. Using pure oxygen instead of air has very small impact on increasing the OCV by 1% under same operational temperature and pressure; hence the use of pure oxygen is no longer defensible motive as this will increase the weight and cost of the system."

Our approach is to generate the streamwise vortices found in the buffer layer by means of a vorticity source in the form of a fictitious body force. It is found that the strongest streaks correspond to a spanwise wavelength that lies within the range of the experimentally observed values for the statistical mean streak spacing. We also present results showing the effect of streamwise pressure gradient, Reynolds number and wall compliance on the sublayer streaks. The theoretical predictions for the effects of wall compliance on the streak characteristics agree well with experimental data. Our proposed theoretical model for the quasi-periodic bursting cycle is also described, which places the streak modelling in context. The proposed bursting process is as follows: (i) streamwise vortices generate sublayer streaks and other vortical elements generate propagating plane waves, (ii) when the streaks reach a sufficient amplitude, they interact nonlinearly with the plane waves to produce oblique waves that exhibit transient growth, and (iii) the oblique waves interact nonlinearly with the plane wave to generate streamwise vortices; these in turn generate the sublayer streaks and so the cycle is renewed."

The linking of the PK model to the PD model is considered with respect to the modulation of cell growth. Our PK - PD model has good agreement with in vitro experimental data.

Their results showed that for relatively low levels of compliance the Type-II eigenmode was destabilized, to be stabilized and ultimately eliminated for higher levels of compliance. The goal of the present study was to obtain the first experimental verification of the prediction that the Type-II mode can be destabilized at low levels of compliance. To this end a new type of rotating-disk apparatus was designed and a new type of material was used to produce suitable compliant walls for the experiments. Background noise in the new facility is substantially reduced in comparison with that in facilities used in related previous studies. This enabled the detection of substantially cleaner hot-film signals. Although the mean base flow remained unchanged, noise characteristics have been improved and turbulence intensities are significantly reduced. The measurements reveal not only the comparatively strong signals from the Type-I (cross-flow vortices) instability mode but also clear evidence of the Type-II eigenmode. In agreement with the theory of Cooper and Carpenter the data analysis shows that relatively low levels of wall compliance destabilize the Type-II mode."

It is found that transition over rough disks occurs in a similar fashion to that over smooth disks, i.e., abruptly and axisymmetrically at well-defined radii. Wall roughness has little effect on Recuntil a threshold relative roughness is reached. Above the threshold Recdecreases sharply. The decrease is consistent with the drop one expects for our flow for the absolute instability discovered by Lingwood [J. Fluid Mech. 299, 17 (1995); 314, 373 (1996); 331, 405 (1997)].

This study aims to assess the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 exposure in closed environments. This is achieved by proposing an innovative COVID-19 exposure prediction framework. The developed framework consists of three modules: Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach, Clustering Module (CM), and Decision Tree (DT) technique. The framework also integrates these modules considering the exposure time factor to identify the level of exposure to COVID-19 in closed environments. A supermarket based in Jordan is considered a case study to test the applicability of the proposed framework in predicting exposure levels and numbers. The impact of Individual and combined NPIs application in closed environment facilities is assessed based on the exposure level and other OIs such as opening time, body temperature measurement, and the number of people inside the supermarket. Key results show that wearing Mask, Face Shield and leaving Social Distance guarantees no exposure to COVID-19 and increases the safety level to 61.9% in a closed environment such as supermarkets with a potential exposure rate of up to 28.5% if otherwise."

    "abstract": "We consider the known phenomenon of torque oscillations and motion instabilities that occur in redundant robots during the execution of sufficiently long Cartesian trajectories when the joint torque is instantaneously minimized. In the framework of on-line local redundancy resolution methods, we propose basic variations of the minimum torque scheme to address this issue. Either the joint torque norm is minimized over two successive discrete-time samples using a short preview window, or we minimize the norm of the difference with respect to a desired momentum-damping joint torque, or the two schemes are combined together. The resulting local control methods are all formulated as well-posed linear-quadratic problems, and their closed-form solutions generate also low joint velocities while addressing the primary torque optimization objectives. Stable and consistent behaviors are obtained along short or long Cartesian position trajectories, as illustrated with simulations on a 3R planar arm and with experiments on a 7R KUKA LWR robot."

    "abstract": "The problem of minimizing the transfer time along a given Cartesian path for redundant robots can be approached in two steps, by separating the generation of a joint path associated to the Cartesian path from the exact minimization of motion time under kinematic\/dynamic bounds along the obtained parametrized joint path. In this framework, multiple sub-optimal solutions can be found, depending on how redundancy is locally resolved in the joint space within the first step. We propose a solution method that works at the acceleration level, by using weighted pseudoinversion, optimizing an inertia-related criterion, and including null-space damping. Several numerical results obtained on different robot systems demonstrate consistently good behaviors and definitely faster motion times in comparison with related methods proposed in the literature. The motion time obtained with our method is reasonably close to the global time-optimal solution along same Cartesian path. Experimental results on a KUKA LWR IV are also reported, showing the tracking control performance on the executed motions."

    "abstract": "In the framework of Human-Robot Collaboration, a robot and a human operator may need to move in close coordination within the same workspace. A contactless coordinated motion can be achieved using vision, mounting a camera either on the robot end-effector or on the human. We consider here one instance of such a visual coordination task, with the robot end-effector that should maintain a prescribed position with respect to a moving RGB-D camera while pointing at it. For the 3D localization of the moving camera, we compare three different techniques and introduce some improvements to the best solution found for our application. For the motion tracking problem, we introduce a relaxed version of the pointing part of the task. This allows to take advantage of the redundancy of the robot, distributing the control effort over the available degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by V-REP simulations and experiments with the 7-dof KUKA LWR manipulator."

Scalogram \u2018spectral\u2019 images were derived from right and left index finger PPG measurements collected using a 3-phase protocol (baseline, unilateral arm pressure cuff occlusion, reactive hyperaemia flush). Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis, namely deep learning, was employed for scalogram image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, \u201cGoogLeNet\u201d), with classification performance obtained using 10-fold stratified cross validation (CV). A conventional machine learning (ML) classifier (K-nearest neighbour, K-NN, K = 9) was also evaluated for comparison with the CNN deep learning methodology. Blood samples were also collected giving 2 biochemical biomarkers ofendothelial function. Test sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, and Kappa statistics were determined.Results: DL-PPG sensitivity was 80.9 % (95% CI, 78.6\u201383.0), specificity 87.7% (85.5\u201389.7), accuracy 83.8 % (82.2\u201385.3), and Kappa 0.68 (0.65\u20130.71).

No differences between patients and controls were found for the biochemical biomarkers of endothelial function.Conclusion: Substantial overall agreement was found between DL-PPG classification and CAD angiography, with DL-PPG performance clearly better than for a conventional ML technique. Our deep learning classification approach, using only basic pre-processing of the PPG pulse waveforms before classification, could offer significant benefits for the diagnosis of CAD in a variety of clinical settings needing low-cost portable and easy-to-use diagnostics."

Web-based diabetes care, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), enables more personalized care.Objective: This study aimed to examine the usability and preliminary efficacy of a web-based AI-driven nutrition platform to support people with diabetes and their carers in identifying healthy recipes, meal planning, and web-based shopping.Methods: Diabetes UK signposted people with diabetes and their carers to the platform\u2019s study-specific portal through its website, social media, and newsletters. A total of 73 adult participants with prediabetes or diabetes or their carers completed the baseline web-based survey. Of these 73 participants, 23 (32%) completed a web-based survey after 8 weeks of platform use. Web-based semistructured interviews were conducted with platform users (7\/23, 30%) who agreed to be followed up and diabetes experts (n=3) who had nutrition and platform knowledge. The intervention consists of a web-based platform that incorporates AI to personalize recipes, meal planning, and shopping list experiences and was made available for 8 weeks. Baseline characteristics, satisfaction, system usability, and diabetes-related and general health indicators were assessed before and after using the platform for 8 weeks.Results: Reductions in weight (mean difference 4.5 kg\/m2, 95% CI 1.0-12.0; P=.009; Cliff \u03b4=0.33) and waist size (mean difference 3.9 cm, 95% CI 2.0-6.5; P=.008; Cliff \u03b4=0.48) were found. Most of the participants (151\/217, 69.6%) did not regularly use the platform and had low or very low engagement scores. However, the platform was perceived as accessible with no need for additional assistance (11\/21, 52%), user-friendly (8\/21, 38%), and easy to use (8\/21, 38%), regardless of some usability issues. Saving recipes was the most popular feature, with 663 saved recipes.Conclusions: This study indicated that the usability of the nutrition platform was well perceived by users and their carers. As participants managed their diabetes well, adding an education component would be specifically relevant for people less familiar with the role of diet in diabetes management. To assess the platform\u2019s effectiveness in improving diabetes-related health indicators, controlled studies with a larger and more diverse participant sample are recommended."

    "abstract": "The photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal is widely measured by clinical and consumer devices, and it is emerging as a potential tool for assessing vascular age. The shape and timing of the PPG pulse wave are both influenced by normal vascular aging, changes in arterial stiffness and blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. This review summarizes research into assessing vascular age from the PPG. Three categories of approaches are described: 1) those which use a single PPG signal (based on pulse wave analysis), 2) those which use multiple PPG signals (such as pulse transit time measurement), and 3) those which use PPG and other signals (such as pulse arrival time measurement). Evidence is then presented on the performance, repeatability and reproducibility, and clinical utility of PPG-derived parameters of vascular age. Finally, the review outlines key directions for future research to realize the full potential of photoplethysmography for assessing vascular age."

One of our authors (CPO), developed a standardised DUS-based scoring system, devised for rapid detection and reporting of PAD. The purpose of this study is to validate this system, determining diagnostic performance both overall, and per disease severity.Methods250 participants were recruited, based on diagnosis (N = 125), or absence of PAD (N = 125) from GP registers. Right and left legs per subject were handled as independent readings, determining actual PAD status via ABPI <0.9, and then further grading disease severity using suggested ABPI ranges. Data were excluded if no corresponding ABPI value was obtained per DUS-determination, or if the ABPI reading was >1.4, owing to risk of false negatives due to incompressible vessels. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were obtained overall, and per severity classification. Furthermore, interrater agreement between ABPI- and DUS-determined PAD severity was determined by linear weighted Cohen\u2019s Kappa.ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity in the detection of disease overall was 81.0% (95% CI 73.4 - 87.2%) and 86.3% (95% CI 82.3 \u2013 89.8%), respectively. From mild to severe PAD, sensitivity increased from 71.1% (95% CI 55.7 \u2013 83.6%) to 89.3% (95% CI 71.8 \u2013 97.7%). Furthermore, a Cohen Kappa value of 0.63 (95% CI 0.57 \u2013 0.69) was obtained, indicating moderate agreement between the two diagnostic methods.ConclusionsFindings in this study validate the diagnostic performance of the standardised DUS scoring system, as well as its capacity to grade severity of disease, offering a potential tool for the identification of PAD in the community \/ research settings following initial screening methods. Confirmatory work could include a comparison of DUS-determined disease with gold-standard methods of non-invasive angiography, and novel tools such as toe-flex NIRS and multi-site photoplethysmography."

Filtering can distort the morphology of the original PPG signal waveform and change the timing of pulse feature points on PPG signals.Weaim to quantitatively investigate the effect of PPG signal morphology (related to measurement site) and type of pulse feature on the filtering-induced time shift (TS). Approach. 60 s PPG signals were measured from six body sites (finger, wrist under (volar), wrist upper (dorsal), earlobe, and forehead) of 36 healthy adults. Using infinite impulse response digital filters which are common in PPG signal processing, PPG signals were prefiltered (band-pass, pass and stop bands:>0.5 Hz and<0.2 Hz for high-pass filter,<20 Hz and>30 Hz for low-pass filter) and then filtered (low-pass, pass and stop bands:<3Hz and>5Hz). Four pulse feature points were defined and extracted (peak, valley, maximal first derivative, and maximal second derivative). For each subject, overall TS and intra-subject TS variability in feature points were calculated as the mean and standard deviation of TS between prefiltered and filtered PPG signals in 50 cardiac cycles. Statistical testing was performed to investigate the effect of measurement site and type of pulse feature on overall TS and intra-subject TS variability. Main results. Measurement site, type of pulse feature, and their interaction had significant impacts on the overall TS and intra-subject TS variability (p?<?0.001 for all). Valley and maximal second derivative showed higher overall TS than peak and maximal first derivative. Finger had higher overall TS and lower intra-subject TS variability than other measurement sites. Significance. Measurement site and type of pulse feature can significantly influence the timing of feature points on filtered PPG signals. Filtering parameters should be quoted to support the reproducibility of PPG-related studies."

As part of a National Institute of Health Research funded project looking at novel diagnostic methods, 250 patients were studied from 15 general practices across North East England from May 2015 and November 2016. Practices identified those with a PAD diagnosis from their registers as well as age- and sex-matched controls. All the ECQs were recorded by a vascular specialist nurse. Duplex vascular ultrasound scanning was used as a reference standard for the diagnosis of occlusive PAD. The ECQ had a sensitivity of 52.5% (95% CI: 42.3%-62.5%), specificity of 87.1% (95% CI: 80.6%-92.0%), positive likelihood ratio of 4.06 (95% CI: 2.57-6.42), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.44-0.68) compared with reference standard DUS. The ECQ has relatively poor overall diagnostic test accuracy in isolation. It may be helpful in ruling out PAD or as a supplementary test to improve diagnosis of symptomatic disease in General Practice."

PAD affects quality of life and life expectancy if not appropriately diagnosed and managed. At risk patients require accurate diagnosis to ensure optimal treatment to slow disease progression and minimize adverse outcomes.Aim:To assess the accuracy of general practice (GP) registration of the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).Design and Setting:An observational analytic case-control study. As part of a National Institute for Health Research\u2013funded (ISRCTN13301188) project assessing novel diagnostic methods set in GP practice.Methods:A total of 125 patients registered as having PAD and 125 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from 15 general practices across North East England. The register was then assessed for accuracy of diagnosis. Duplex vascular ultrasound scanning (DUS) undertaken by vascular scientists was used as the gold standard reference for PAD.Results:The PAD register had a sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 77%-92%) and specificity of 74% (95% CI 67%-81%) when compared with DUS. The positive predictive value, however, was 69.6% (95% CI 63%-75%) and negative predictive value 88.8% (95% CI 82%-92%). The overall diagnostic effectiveness of the PAD register was 79.2% (95% CI 73%-84%).Conclusion:This analysis indicates that while PAD is detected with reasonable sensitivity in primary care, many patients registered with a diagnosis of PAD lacked DUS-proven disease. Improved approaches to the objective diagnosis of PAD may improve diagnosis and management of PAD in primary care."

However, it is unclear how it varies across the full age spectrum from child to senior and for different peripheral measurement sites. The objectives of this study were to determine the association between age and pulse risetime characteristics over an 8-decade age range at the ears, fingers, and toes, and to consider effects arising from differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP), height and heart rate. APPROACH: Multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) pulse waveforms were recorded non-invasively from the right and left ears, fingers, and toes of 304 normal healthy human subjects (range 6-87 years; 156 male and 148 female). SBP, height, and heart rate were also measured. Multi-site PPG pulse risetimes, and their site differences, were determined. MAIN RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis showed positive correlations with risetime for age (ears, fingers and toes: + 0.8, + 1.9, and + 1.1 ms\/year, respectively), SBP (+0.5, + 1.3, and + 0.9 ms\/mmHg) and height (+0.5, + 1.2, and + 1.0 ms\/cm), but with a clear inverse association with heart rate (-1.8, - 2.5, and - 1.6 ms min) (P < 0.0001). No significant differences between male and female subjects were found for pulse risetime. SIGNIFICANCE: Normative multi-site PPG risetime characteristics have been defined in over 300 subjects and are shown to increase with age linearly up to the 8th decade. In contrast, we have shown that heart rate has a clear inverse relationship with risetime for all measurement sites."

    "abstract": "Hypertension affects an estimated 1.4 billion people and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention can potentially decrease cardiovascular events later in life. However, blood pressure (BP) measurements take time and require training for health care professionals. The measurements are also inconvenient for patients to access, numerous daily variables affect BP values, and only a few BP readings can be collected per session. This leads to an unmet need for an accurate, 24-h continuous, and portable BP measurement system. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been considered as an alternative way to measure BP and may meet this need. This review summarizes the literature published from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2020, on the use of only ECG wave morphology to monitor BP or identify hypertension. From 35 articles analyzed (9 of those with no listed comorbidities and confounders), the P wave, QTc intervals and TpTe intervals may be promising for this purpose. Unfortunately, with the limited number of articles and the variety of participant populations, we are unable to make conclusions about the effectiveness of ECG-only BP monitoring. We provide 13 recommendations for future ECG-only BP monitoring studies and highlight the limited findings in pregnant and pediatric populations. With the advent of convenient and portable ECG signal recording in smart devices and wearables such as watches, understanding how to apply ECG-only findings to identify hypertension early is crucial to improving health outcomes worldwide."

Methods: People with diabetes (n\u00a0=\u00a0110), neuropathy and history of\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 foot ulcer participated in a single-blind multicentre clinical trial. Feet were imaged with a novel thermal imaging device (Diabetic Foot Ulcer Prevention System). Participants were randomized to intervention (active thermography + standard foot care) or control (blinded thermography + standard foot care) and were followed up monthly until ulcer recurrence or for 12\u00a0months. Foot thermograms of participants from the intervention group were assessed for hot spots (areas with temperature\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.2\u00b0C higher than the corresponding contralateral site) and acted upon as per local standards. Results: After 12\u00a0months, 62% of participants were ulcer-free in the intervention group and 56% in the control group. The odds ratios of ulcer recurrence (intervention vs control) were 0.82 (95% CI 0.38, 1.8; P\u00a0=\u00a00.62) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.21, 1.4; P\u00a0=\u00a00.22) in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, respectively.

Conclusions: Monthly intervention with thermal imaging did not result in a significant reduction in ulcer recurrence rate or increased ulcer-free survival in this cohort at high risk of foot ulcers.

    "abstract": "Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of death, yet hypertension commonly goes undetected. Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010\u20132019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement. Our literature review reveals promising measurement accuracies and we comment on the effective combinations of modalities and success of this technology"

    "abstract": "Objective: People with diabetic neuropathy who have previously ulcerated are at high risk of re-ulceration. They should regularly attend podiatry clinics for surveillance and routine protective podiatric treatment. It has been suggested that inflammation prior to skin breakdown shows up as a hotspot on a thermal image even in the absence of clinical signs. The aim of this study is to quantify inter-patient and intra-patient thermal variations presented by diabetic feet at high risk of ulceration. Approach: Whole foot and spot temperatures were recorded for 96 patients who attended two successive podiatry appointments without ulceration 28 [28, 31] days apart, median [interquartile range]. This was a part of a longer study into whether thermal imaging in clinic can reduce the rate of re-ulceration. Main results: The variation in spot temperature right\/left differences for single patients between visits was comparable to the variation observed between patients (0.8 [0.3, 1.5] \u00b0C compared with 0.9 [0.4, 1.7] \u00b0C). Similarly, whole foot temperature variation for a single patient between visits was comparable to the variation observed between patients (0.6 [0.2, 1.1] \u00b0C compared with 0.8 [0.2, 1.3] \u00b0C). Significance: Thresholds which depend on thermal differences from visit to visit are unlikely to have sufficient specificity to effectively target treatment designed to prevent the development of foot ulcers."

    "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most prevalent diseases and is often called the \"silent killer\" because there are usually no early symptoms. Hypertension is also associated with multiple morbidities, including chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Early detection and intervention are therefore important. The current routine method for diagnosing hypertension is done using a sphygmomanometer, which can only provide intermittent blood pressure readings and can be confounded by various factors, such as white coat hypertension, time of day, exercise, or stress. Consequently, there is an increasing need for a non-invasive, cuff-less, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device. Multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) is a promising new technology that can measure a range of features of the pulse, including the pulse transit time of the arterial pulse wave, which can be used to continuously estimate arterial blood pressure. This is achieved by detecting the pulse wave at one body site location and measuring the time it takes for it to reach a second, distal location. The purpose of this review is to analyze the current research in multi-site PPG for blood pressure assessment and provide recommendations to guide future research. In a systematic search of the literature from January 2010 to January 2019, we found 13 papers that proposed novel methods using various two-channel PPG systems and signal processing techniques to acquire blood pressure using multi-site PPG that offered promising results. However, we also found a general lack of validation in terms of sample size and diversity of populations."

Seven single-finger or finger combinations (derived from the middle and ring fingers) were then tested for sensitivity for the presence of two markers of capillary abnormality [presence of giant capillaries and an SSc grade (early, active or late)] compared with assessment of all eight fingers.ResultsFor the eight-finger gold standard, sensitivity against the diagnostic criteria was 74.6% (53.0% for the presence of giants alone and 73.1% for image grade alone). Examining only one finger gave low sensitivity (ranging from right middle 31.7% to left ring 46.6%). Examining both ring fingers gave a sensitivity of 59.8%, whereas examining the four-finger combination of both ring and both middle fingers gave a sensitivity of 66.7%.ConclusionDuring routine capillaroscopic examination, ideally all eight nailbeds (excluding thumbs) should be examined, otherwise some abnormalities will be missed.

Drawing on the negotiated order perspective, we explore the process by which commissioning organisations make their decisions to commission innovative health technologies. The empirical backdrop to this discussion is provided by a case study exploring the commissioning considerations for a new photoplethysmography-based diagnostic technology for peripheral arterial disease in primary care in the UK.MethodsThe research involved an empirical case study of four Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) involved in the commissioning of services in primary and secondary care. Semi-structured in-depth interviews (16 in total) and two focus groups (a total of eight people participated, four in each group) were conducted with key individuals involved in commissioning services in the NHS including (i) senior NHS clinical leaders and directors (ii) commissioners and health care managers across CCGs and (iii) local general practitioners.ResultsCommissioning of a new diagnostic technology for peripheral arterial disease in primary care involves high levels of protracted negotiations over funding between providers and commissioners, alliance building, conflict resolution and compromise of objectives where the outcomes of change are highly contingent upon interventions made across different care settings. Our evidence illustrates how reconfigurations of inter-organisational relations, and of clinical and related work practices required for the successful implementation of a new technology could become the major challenge in commissioning negotiations.ConclusionsInnovative health technologies such as the diagnostic technology for peripheral arterial disease are commissioned in care pathways where the value of such technology is realised by those delivering care to patients. The detail of how care pathways are commissioned is complex and involves high degrees of uncertainty concerning such issues as prioritisation decisions, patient benefits, clinical buy-in, value for money and unintended consequences.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease is a global health problem, affecting around 20% of people aged over 60 years. Whilst ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is regularly used for diagnosis, it has a number of limitations, which have presented a need for alternative methods of diagnosis. Multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) is one such method, but evidence of acceptability of both methods is lacking. This study aims to describe and compare preferences and experiences amongst nurses and patients of ABPI and MPPG use in primary care. We used qualitative research methods in the context of a clinical diagnostic study comparing ABPI with MPPG. Use of ABPI and MPPG by 13 nurses were observed with 51 patients across general practice surgeries in North-East England in 2015\/16. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 nurses and 27 patients. Data were thematically analysed. Two major themes were identified: (1) device preferences; (2) test discomfort and anxiety. There was a compelling preference for MPPG due to ease of use, speed of the test, patient comfort, and perceived device accuracy\/objectivity. However some patients struggled to identify a preference, describing ambivalence to medical testing. ABPI was deemed uncomfortable and painful, particularly when the blood pressure cuff was inflated at the lower limbs. There was also evidence of anxiety amongst patients when their foot pulses were not identified using ABPI. Whilst ABPI is a non-invasive and routine procedure it was associated with a number of drawbacks in clinical practice. Nurses required considerable dexterity to employ the test, and it resulted in anxiety amongst some patients. Conversely, MPPG was deemed to be easier and quicker to use, and perceived to be less subjective. Should diagnostic accuracy and cost be comparable to ABPI, then the findings of this study suggest MPPG would be preferable to ABPI for patients as well as nurses."

Annual reviews could provide an opportunity to probe for PAD symptoms and highlight those requiring further investigation. Improved information when PAD is diagnosed and, considering the propensity for patients to tolerate worsening symptoms, the introduction of annual follow-up (at minimum) is warranted."

However, pulse changes across a range of peripheral body sites have seldom been explored with this challenge. The primary aim of this pilot study was to utilize multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) technology to quantify the phase delays, i.e., correlation lags, between changes in heart rate and changes in key pulse features with slow-paced breathing (0.1 Hz).Methods: Waveforms were collected simultaneously from the right and left ear lobes, thumbs, and great toes of 18 healthy adult subjects. Cross correlation lags between reference beat-to-beat changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) R-R wave interval and changes in pulse arrival time (foot of pulse; PATf) and also for pulse amplitude (foot-to-peak; AMP) were determined.Results: Relative to R-R changes, the median ear, thumb, and toe PATf correlation lags were 3.4, 2.9, and 2.1 beats, respectively; contrasting to AMP with 5.7, 6.0, and 6.9 beats, respectively. These PATf correlation lags in beats were significantly lower than for the AMP measure. Segmental differences between sites and timing measure variability have also been quantified.Conclusion: This pilot study has indicated bilateral similarity plus segmental differences for relative delays in PPG pulse timing and amplitude measures relative to R-R interval changes with paced breathing. These correlation and variability data are now available for comparison with cardiovascular patient groups to support development of autonomic function assessment techniques."

    "abstract": "A sensing device includes a sensor housing mounting sensor elements and an attachment member, the attachment member including first and second components. The first component is configured to receive the sensor housing therein and to permit rotational movement between the attachment member and the sensor housing and to restrict relative movement between the attachment member and the sensor housing in the axial direction of the sensor housing. The second component includes a flexible membrane that is attachable to an underside of the first component attached to an underside of the first component, the flexible membrane extending at least in part beyond an outer edge of the first component. The flexible membrane allows for attachment of the attachment member to a patient, and the attachment member is adapted to allow passage of non-ionising radiation from the sensor housing to the patient."

Approach: Proof of concept evaluation using our previously published multi-site PPG pulse data set (110 participants included; age\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u200940 years; 44% PAD by ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI)). Two main pulse encoding rules using the risetime as an example feature to mark each heartbeat in a 6\u2009s analysis study window: if risetime at both great toes\u2009\u2009\u2264time threshold ('no PAD' state) then heartbeat marked with a single 5\u2009kHz audio tone; if risetime from either great toe\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009threshold ('PAD') then heartbeat marked with a distinct train of 5\u2009kHz audio tones. A simple spectrogram visual plot was also produced for each participant's audio signals. ROC curve analysis first determined an appropriate risetime threshold using the simple-to-evaluate PAD Visualizer and then re-tested at this level with PAD Sounder and classification performance summarized. Main results: The pulse encoding rules used were easy to learn. Visualizer best communication performance at risetime 0.27\u2009s gave specificity 80.6%, sensitivity 95.8%, accuracy 87.3%, negative predictive value 96.2%, and Kappa statistic of 0.75. Classification performance for blinded assessment with audio PAD Sounder was identical. Significance: Substantial agreements demonstrated between Sounder\/Visualizer disease techniques and the ABPI PAD reference. These simple-to-use PAD communications methods when embedded into an appropriate device platform could offer significant benefits in PAD diagnosis for a range of clinical settings, including primary care where low-cost, portable and easy-to-use diagnostics can be desirable."

A non-invasive screening tool that can identify impending decline is sought. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the microcirculation in Fontan-palliated patients by measuring tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) in superficial and deeper tissues. Approach: Three patient cohorts were studied: Fontan group (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20098) and two patient control groups, liver disease group (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20098) and tetralogy of Fallot group (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20099). 22 healthy controls were also examined. Superficial and deeper StO2 was measured at the forearm, thenar eminence, index and ring fingers of both arms using the LEA O2C spectrophotometry device. Main results: Superficial StO2 was reduced in Fontan patients compared to healthy controls (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.002) and tetralogy patients (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.016), but not compared to the liver group (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.313). Deeper StO2 was similar between groups (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.112). The gap between deeper and superficial StO2 was raised in Fontan patients compared to healthy controls (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.001) and tetralogy patients (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.037), but not compared to the liver group (p\u200a\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.504). There was no clinically relevant difference in StO2 between the left and right arms, and the variation in StO2 according to measurement site was similar between the four groups. Significance: Vascular optical spectrophotometry is a feasible non-invasive measure of micro-circulatory function that can easily be performed in the clinic setting and may have utility in patients with Fontan circulations. Further, we provide important normal range data in the healthy control population which can be used to design future studies."

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition that causes significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, and can have a serious economic impact. It is often underdiagnosed in primary care, partially due to the fact that the current National Institute for Health Care and Excellence-recommended ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) test for PAD in primary care is time-consuming and is technically challenging to perform. The availability of a simple, reliable diagnostic test has the potential to facilitate early PAD identification and treatment.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the preferences of primary care practitioners relating to the key characteristics for a new medical device for PAD detection.ParticipantsA sample of 116 UK primary care setting clinicians involved in the diagnosis and\/or management of PAD, comprising of doctors (n\u2009=\u200995), nurses (n\u2009=\u200917), health care assistants (n\u2009=\u20091) and other unspecified clinicians (n\u2009=\u20093).OutcomesRelative weights derived from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), by primary care practitioners regarding six key characteristics of the new device: device display, data integration, training, power supply, portability of the device, and cost.ResultsFive characteristics were important for preferences. Practitioners favoured manual, as opposed to automated, integration of test results into patient records. Practitioners strongly preferred disposable batteries as the power supply for the device compared with other alternatives.ConclusionsThis novel study has successfully utilised a DCE to elicit primary care practitioner\u2019s preferences for the development of the new device. The preferences can help inform device design and therefore facilitate\/help to maximise its uptake and buy-in from the outset."

Beat-to-beat analysis of the PPG waveform enables the study of the variability of pulse features, such as the amplitude and the pulse arrival time (PAT), and when quantified in the time and frequency domains, has considerable potential to shed light on perfusion changes associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In this pilot study, innovative multi-site bilateral finger and toe PPG recordings from 43 healthy control subjects and 31 PAD subjects were compared (recordings each at least five minutes, collected in a warm temperature-controlled room). Beat-to-beat normalized amplitude variability and PAT variability were then quantified in the time-domain using two simple statistical measures and in the frequency-domain bilaterally using magnitude squared coherence (MSC). Significantly reduced normalized amplitude variability (healthy control 0.0384 (interquartile range 0.0217\u20130.0744) vs. PAD 0.0160 (0.0080\u20130.0338) (p < 0.0001)) and significantly increased PAT variability (healthy control 0.0063 (0.0052\u20130.0086) vs. PAD 0.0093 (0.0078\u20130.0144) (p < 0.0001)) was demonstrated for the toe site in PAD using the time-domain analysis. Frequency-domain analysis demonstrated significantly lower MSC values across a range of frequency bands for PAD patients. These changes suggest a loss of right-to-left body side coherence and cardiovascular control in PAD. This study has also demonstrated the feasibility of using these measurement and analysis methods in studies investigating multi-site PPG variability for a wide range of cardiac and vascular patient groups."

We use innovative multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) pulse measurement and analysis technology to assess changes in arterial stiffness in paediatric heart transplant recipients (HTRs) in comparison with healthy control (HC) children.APPROACH: A group of 20 HTRs (median age 13.5 years, eight male) were compared to an overall age- and gender-matched group of 161 HCs (median age 11.6 years, 74 male). Peripheral pulse was recorded bilaterally using MPPG at the ear lobe, index finger and great toe sites, along with an electrocardiogram cardiac timing reference. Segmental pulse arrival times between peripheral sites (finger-ear, PATf-e; toe-finger, PATt-f; and toe-ear PATt-e) were calculated as arterial stiffness measures, and differences between subject groups were tested using multivariate analysis. Normalised ear, finger and toe pulse shapes were also studied and compared between groups.MAIN RESULTS: After correction for heart rate and diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures, the HTR group was found to have significantly lower segmental PATt-e and PATt-f measurements, with median values of 150\u2009ms versus 172\u2009ms in the HC group (p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.02), and 104 ms versus 118 ms in the HC group (p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.01), respectively, consistent with increased arterial stiffness in the patient group. The normalised ear, finger and toe sites showed only a mild elongation in each pulse rise time for the transplant group.SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that innovative and easy-to-do MPPG gives further evidence for increased arterial stiffness in children who have undergone successful cardiac transplantation."

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the diagnostic value of novel optical non-invasive skin fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) and tissue oxygen saturation (TOS) viability measurements in patients with established SSc. Approach: Two groups were studied, comprising 14 SSc patients and nine healthy controls (93% and 73% females, respectively). FS and TOS measurements were collected from three body sites: the forearm, chest, and calf. Fluorescence intensities at wavelengths attributed to collagen, elastin, and L-tryptophan were computed, with adjustment for melanin, and a normalised combined fluorescence score (NCFS) was determined. Main results: The NCFS was significantly higher (p\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.001) and the combined TOS significantly lower (p\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.001) in the SSc group. TOS measurements alone showed good classification accuracy (95.7%) at separating SSc from healthy control participants, with some clustering of values close to the 50% oxygenation level in both groups. When the composition and viability measures were combined and modelled using binary logistic regression, excellent results for the sample were obtained following leave one out cross validation (100%). Significance: The results of this pilot study demonstrate the potential diagnostic utility of FS and TOS assessments in SSc patients and further work is now needed to validate these techniques prospectively in a larger group of SSc patients across the spectrum of the disease, and also patients with other types of vasculopathy and conditions that can cause skin fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Physiological signals can often become contaminated by noise from a variety of origins. In this paper, an algorithm is described for the reduction of sporadic noise from a continuous periodic signal. The design can be used where a sample of a periodic signal is required, for example, when an average pulse is needed for pulse wave analysis and characterization. The algorithm is based on cluster analysis for selecting similar repetitions or pulses from a periodic single. This method selects individual pulses without noise, returns a clean pulse signal, and terminates when a sufficiently clean and representative signal is received. The algorithm is designed to be sufficiently compact to be implemented on a microcontroller embedded within a medical device. It has been validated through the removal of noise from an exemplar photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, showing increasing benefit as the noise contamination of the signal increases. The algorithm design is generalised to be applicable for a wide range of physiological (physical) signals."

    "abstract": "BackgroundThermal imaging is a useful modality for identifying preulcerative lesions (\u201chot spots\u201d) in diabetic foot patients. Despite its recognised potential, at present, there is no readily available instrument for routine podiatric assessment of patients at risk. To address this need, a novel thermal imaging system was recently developed. This paper reports the reliability of this device for temperature assessment of healthy feet.MethodsPlantar skin foot temperatures were measured with the novel thermal imaging device (Diabetic Foot Ulcer Prevention System (DFUPS), constructed by Photometrix Imaging Ltd) and also with a hand-held infrared spot thermometer (Thermofocus\u00ae 01500A3, Tecnimed, Italy) after 20 min of barefoot resting with legs supported and extended in 105 subjects (52 males and 53 females; age range 18 to 69 years) as part of a multicentre clinical trial. The temperature differences between the right and left foot at five regions of interest (ROIs), including 1st and 4th toes, 1st, 3rd and 5th metatarsal heads were calculated. The intra-instrument agreement (three repeated measures) and the inter-instrument agreement (hand-held thermometer and thermal imaging device) were quantified using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsBoth devices showed almost perfect agreement in replication by instrument. The intra-instrument ICCs for the thermal imaging device at all five ROIs ranged from 0.95 to 0.97 and the intra-instrument ICCs for the hand-held-thermometer ranged from 0.94 to 0.97. There was substantial to perfect inter-instrument agreement between the hand-held thermometer and the thermal imaging device and the ICCs at all five ROIs ranged between 0.94 and 0.97.ConclusionsThis study reports the performance of a novel thermal imaging device in the assessment of foot temperatures in healthy volunteers in comparison with a hand-held infrared thermometer. The newly developed thermal imaging device showed very good agreement in repeated temperature assessments at defined ROIs as well as substantial to perfect agreement in temperature assessment with the hand-held infrared thermometer. In addition to the reported non-inferior performance in temperature assessment, the thermal imaging device holds the potential to provide an instantaneous thermal image of all sites of the feet (plantar, dorsal, lateral and medial views)."

Relevant data were extracted, and studies were quality assessed.ResultsSeven studies were included in the final review, all of which were published between 1995 and 2014. There was wide variation in the types of diagnostic test compared. The majority of the studies (six of seven) referenced the sources used to develop their model, and all studies stated and justified the structural assumptions. Reporting of the data within the included studies could have been improved. Only one identified study focused on the cost-effectiveness of a test typically used in primary care.ConclusionsThis review brings together all applied modelling methods for tests used in the diagnosis of PAD, which could be used to support future model-based economic evaluations in this field.

In this study, a new approach was investigated for the potential use of four fuel components as coolants for direct liquid-cooled (LC)-BTMS, N-Pentane, N-Hexane, N-Butane, and Cyclo-Pentane. The performance of the fuel components was numerically analysed and CFD modelled using ANSYS Fluent software. Several meshing iterations of the lithium-ion battery (LIB) module were performed to conduct mesh independence check for higher accuracy and less computational time. The LIB module was simulated, in comparison to a free air convection (FAC)-BTMS as a benchmark, at three discharge rates (1C, 1.5C, 2C) for each of the inlet velocity values (0.1, 0.5, 1 m\/s). Results show that FAC-BTMS exceeded the LIB module optimal operating temperature range (293\u2013313 K) at 2C. On average, at the worst condition (lowest inlet velocity and highest discharge rate), all fuel components of the LC-BTMS were able to maintain the LIB module temperature below 288 K. That is at least 4.7% cooler compared to FAC-BTMS, which renders the new approach viable alternative to the conventional BTMS."

The proposed approach is to use biodiesel as the engine feed and coolant. A 3S2P LIB module is simulated using Ansys-Fluent CFD software tool. Four selective dielectric biodiesels are used as coolants, namely palm, karanja, jatropha, and mahua oils. In comparison to the conventional coolants in BTMS, mainly air and 3M Novec, biodiesel fuels have been proven as coolants to maintain LIB temperature within the optimum working range.

    "abstract": "The design of energy efficient engineering systems is crucial for sustainable operation when economic and environmental consequences are considered. Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boilers, which are among the major contributors to world electricity production, are still increasing in numbers and unit sizes. Primary air nozzles are key components of CFB boilers that may decrease energy consumption and increase energy efficiency, and they need to be carefully designed. There are certain types of nozzles commonly used in the air distribution grate, but even minor design improvements on the nozzle can significantly decrease the pressure loss. This work is about optimizing the bell-type primary air nozzle used in the Turkish lignite-fired \u00c7AN Thermal Power Plant (CTPP), which has two 160 MWe CFB boilers, through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Initially, the bell-type nozzle was designed newly by changing the inner head holes geometry. After that, the nozzle geometry was optimized by changing the orifice size and angle to decrease the pressure drop, increase the orifice velocity outlet, and flow uniformity through CFD simulations. With the optimum nozzle geometry, the velocity at the outlet orifices was increased, and a decrease of 2.86 kPa was achieved in the total pressure loss. Furthermore, when the nozzle orifices were designed downwardly with an angle of 105\u00b0, pressure drop across the nozzle decreased by 7.6%, and the uniformity index increased by 2 % at the outlet orifices. Using the bell-type primary air nozzle, which is newly designed, in the CTPP boiler not only will save 2.26 GWh\/year of energy consumption but also minimize the backflow risk in the boiler operation."

This article introduces an intelligent control of an organic structure solar supercapacitor (OSSC) for EVs to meet electrical load demands with solar renewable energy. A carbon fibre-reinforced polymer, nano zinc oxide (ZnO), and copper oxide (CuO) fillers have been used in the development of OSSC prototypes. The organic solar cell, electrical circuits, converter, controller, circuit breaker switch, and batteries were all integrated for the modelling of OSSCs. A carbon fibre (CF)-reinforced CuO-doped polymer was utilised to improve the concentration of electrons. The negative electrodes of the CF were strengthened with nano ZnO epoxy to increase the mobility of electrons as an n-type semiconductor (energy band gap 3.2\u20133.4 eV) and subsequently increased to 3.5 eV by adding 6% \u03c0-carbon. The electrodes of the CF were strengthened with epoxy-filled nano-CuO as a p-type semiconductor to facilitate bore\/positive charging. They improve the conductivity of the OSSC. The OSSC power storage was controlled by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy intelligent system controller to meet the load demand of EVs and auxiliary battery charging. Moreover, a fully charged OSSC (solar irradiance = 1000 W\/m2) produced 561 W\u00b7h\/m2 to meet the vehicle load demand with 45 A of auxiliary battery charging current. Therefore, the OSSC can save 15% in energy efficiency and contribute to emission control. The integration of an OSSC with an EV battery can minimise the weight and capacity of the battery by 7.5% and 10%, respectively."

    "abstract": "The design of energy efficient engineering systems is crucial for sustainable operation when economic and environmental consequences are considered. Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boilers, which are among the major contributors to world electricity production, are still increasing in numbers and unit sizes. Primary air nozzles are key components of CFB boilers that may decrease energy consumption and increase energy efficiency, and they need to be carefully designed. There are certain types of nozzles commonly used in the air distribution grate, but even minor design improvements on the nozzle can significantly decrease the pressure loss. This work is about optimizing the bell-type primary air nozzle used in the Turkish lignite-fired \u00c7AN Thermal Power Plant (CTPP), which has two 160 MWe CFB boilers, through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Initially, the bell-type nozzle was designed newly by changing the inner head holes geometry. After that, the nozzle geometry was optimized by changing the orifice size and angle to decrease the pressure drop, increase the orifice velocity outlet, and flow uniformity through CFD simulations. With the optimum nozzle geometry, the velocity at the outlet orifices was increased, and a decrease of 2.86 kPa was achieved in the total pressure loss. Furthermore, when the nozzle orifices were designed downwardly with an angle of 105\u00b0, pressure drop across the nozzle decreased by 7.6%, and the uniformity index increased by 2 % at the outlet orifices. Using the bell-type primary air nozzle, which is newly designed, in the CTPP boiler not only will save 2.26 GWh\/year of energy consumption but also minimize the backflow risk in the boiler operation."

    "abstract": "Battery thermal management system (BTMS) design is crucial for its performance, which can be associated with extra costs and system complexity. Most of the current studies are focused on the BTMS design but with a little focus on the improvement of coolants. In this work, the feasibility of using combustion engine fuel for the LIB thermal management of hybrid electric vehicles is investigated. N-heptane is used as a dielectric hydrocarbon coolant in the introduced system. The thermal performance of the proposed system is investigated numerically using the CFD software ANSYS-Fluent. To benchmark and validate the system performance, a comparative study is made among other common approaches, including the use of air and 3M-Novec 7200. A variety of input parameters are accounted for, including inlet velocities and discharge rates. The results show that air cooling is the least effective method to control the battery module temperature uniformity and the Li-ion battery safety limit. At the same time, n-heptane and 3M-Novec 7200 have shown good control of the module temperature range (20 \u00b0C\u201340 \u00b0C) at various discharge rates and different inlet velocities. However, using n-heptane is a considerable improvement to the cost of the system and reduction in its weight and maximum temperature, compared to that using 3M-Novec 7200 coolant. For instance, at 0.1 m\u00b7s-1, n-heptane has reduced the Li-ion battery maximum temperature at 1C and 2C discharge rates by more than 7.9 \u00b0C (2.6%) and 17.9 \u00b0C (5.65%), respectively, compared to those predicted using the same battery module without cooling."

The results reveal that the free convection currents in inclined and horizontal positions of the module were weaker relative to the vertical position. Also, the increase in the length of inclined photovoltaic module, up to 1.3 m, enhances the heat transfer rate. However, beyond this length, the temperature of the module becomes higher, and the convective heat transfer coefficients are reduced regardless of the inclination. In the horizontal position, the convective heat transfer rate is lower, particularly on the bottom surface of PV system."

The new approach is aimed to reduce the full composition of fuel to a much smaller number of components based on their mass fractions to formulate fuel surrogates. The formulated surrogates for gasoline and blended ethanol\/gasoline fuels matched the data of the full compositions of the same fuels for droplet lifetime, surface temperature, density, vapour pressure, H\/C ratio, molar weight and research octane number, using the CFSM. Also, the cetane number and viscosity of diesel and biodiesel\/diesel blends were mimicked by their suggested surrogates. The results were verified, with up to 7.2% errors between the two sets of predicted droplet lifetimes: surrogates and full compositions of fuels."

The customized version of CONVERGE is validated against measurements for a single droplet of n\u2010heptane and n\u2010decane mixture. It is shown that the new heating and evaporation model better agrees with the experimental data than those predicted by the built\u2010in heating and evaporation model, which does not consider the effects of temperature gradient and assumes infinitely fast species diffusion inside droplets. The simulation of a hollow\u2010cone spray of primary reference fuel (PRF65) is performed and validated against experimental data taken from the literature. Finally, the newly implemented model is tested by running full\u2010cycle engine simulations, representing partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) using PRF65 as the fuel. These simulations are successfully performed for two start of injection timings, 20 and 25 crank angle (CA) before top\u2010dead\u2010centre (BTDC). The results show good agreement with experimental data where the effect of heating and evaporation of droplets on combustion phasing is investigated. The results highlight the importance of the accurate modelling of physical processes during droplet heating and evaporation for the prediction of the PPCI engine performance."

First is a modification to the de Laval nozzle from single to dual and triple supersonic nozzles to reduce the degree of aerodynamic heating at the supersonic channel walls. The latter is conducted with a separation to the supersonic flow regime into three parallel interfacing flow sub-regimes. Second is the introduction of water droplets into the supersonic flow channel to absorb the evaporation latent heat equivalent energy. The droplet evaporation has shown a noticeable enhancement in the cooling effects with up to 8 \u2103 temperature drops. The model has been compared to the experimental data for compatible results."

Using this algorithm, the effects of transient diffusion of species on droplet lifetimes are investigated for mixtures of Diesel and E85 (85% vol. ethanol and 15% vol. gasoline) fuels. It is shown that the new algorithm can reduce the analysis of the E85-Diesel fuel droplets, taking into account the contributions of up to119 components at the initial stage of heating and evaporation, to that based on 5 QC\/Cs, near the end of droplet evaporation, with up to 1.9% errors in predicted droplet temperatures and radii. The CPU time needed to perform calculations using the new algorithm is shown to be 80% less than that when considering the full composition of fuel."

There is pressure on the economy of the country due to the massive reliance on fossil fuels, and this tendency is influenced by various environmental impacts. To overcome the burden on fossil fuels, more attention has been drawn to provide fossil fuel substitution. Tire pyrolysis is among the effective substitutes of the fuel technology that generates useful products of liquid oil, char, and pyro gas. This research focuses on the environmental, social, and economic viability of tire pyrolysis oil in Pakistan. This study estimates the production and potential of tire pyrolysis oil (TPO) in Pakistan. Based on the calculations, the potential of tire pyrolysis oil production in Pakistan from 2015\u20132019 is 468,081 to 548,406 tons. The potential production of TPO in 2018\u20132019 was ~8.30% of the total import (6.6 million tons) of crude oil. Therefore, tire pyrolysis oil is considered an alternative fuel representing an economic and environmentally viability solution for Pakistan."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic systems have undergone substantial growth for the past twenty years and more than 75% of the solar irradiance is absorbed, but only a small amount of the captured solar energy is transformed into electricity (e.g. 7-24%). The remaining energy can cause overheating and damage to adhesive seals, delamination and non-homogeneous temperatures. In this paper a three-step strategy is presented for the development of an energy efficient hybrid photovoltaic\/thermal air system by the combination of experimentally validated computation fluid dynamics and optimal Latin hypercubes design of experiments. The combined thermo-hydraulic and electrical performances of five air flow configurations are examined after the selection of several design parameters. The parametric study reveals that the most promising configuration is co-current air flow through two channels above and below the photovoltaic cell. A multi-objective design optimisation process is undertaken for this configuration, where the system is represented by three design variables: the collector, the depths of the lower air flow and the upper air flow channels. A 50-point design of experiments is constructed within the design variables space using a permutation genetic algorithm. The multi-objective design optimisation methodology entails an accurate surrogate modelling to create Pareto curves which demonstrate clearly the compromises that may be taken between fan fluid and electric powers, and between the electric and thermal efficiencies. The design optimisation demonstrates how the design variables affect each of the four system performance parameters. The thermal and electric efficiencies are improved from 44.5% to 50.1% and from 10.0% to 10.5%, respectively."

The focus of the review is on the group of models based on the implementation of the analytical solutions to the heat transfer and species diffusion equations inside droplets into numerical codes. Four key aspects are summarized: (1) application of the Discrete Component (DC) model and the Multi-Dimensional Quasi-Discrete Model (MDQDM) to a broad range of fuels, including petrol, diesel, ethanol, and biodiesel fuels and their blends, (2) formulation of fuel surrogates, with a focus on the recently introduced Complex Fuel Surrogate Model (CFSM), (3) overview of the recently introduced transient algorithm, Transient Multi-Dimensional Quasi-Discrete Model (TMDQDM), for an autogeneration of quasi-components, and (4) implementation of the latter into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code for a realistic engineering application to full cycle simulation in internal combustion engines. The original and modified versions of the DC model and MDQDM are evaluated for the heating and evaporation of droplets of bio\/fossil-fuel (e.g., ethanol\/petrol\/biodiesel\/diesel) blends. These were implemented into commercial CFD software and validated. The feasibility of formulating complex fuel surrogates for fuel blends, their implementation into CFD codes, and their application in the full engine cycle simulation before and after the onset of combustion (autoignition) are described."

On this ground, the present research illustrated the synthesis of nickel-copper bimetallic nanoparticles (Ni\u2013Cu BNPs) with copper chloride (CuCl2) and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O) salt precursors in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

Wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations have been set-up and conducted to understand the concept vehicle aerodynamic structure and needs for performance improvement. A computer-aided design model has been developed and implemented into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software of StarCCM+ for detailed analysis. A 1\/4th full-scale fibreglass model has been manufactured for validation. The combined experimental and CFD analyses show that the original aesthetic design exhibits high rear-end lift-force. Modifications have been assessed to improve the drag and lift forces for the front, middle and rear regions. Several geometrical changes are introduced, including new rear-wing design. Also, the front end, roof profile and various ducting modifications have been considered. The introduced design changes lead to optimised downforce of -560.18 N with negligible increase to the accumulated drag effects with C_D\u22640.3."

The method of life cycle costing and economic data are considered to estimate the cost of hydrogen for centralised and decentralised production processes. In the current study, two major hydrogen production methods are considered, methane reforming and water electrolysis. The costing frameworks are defined for hydrogen production, transportation and final application. The results show that hydrogen production via centralised methane reforming is financially viable for future transport applications. The ownership cost of HFCVs shows the highest cost among other costs of life cycle analysis."

    "abstract": "A micro gas turbine (MGT) can potentially be an alternative power source to the conventional internal combustion engine as a range extender in hybrid electric vehicles. The integration of the MGT into a hybrid vehicle needs a new approach for technical validation requirements compared to the testing of an internal combustion engine. Several attributes of the MGT are predicted to cause concerns for vehicle sub-system requirements such as high ambient temperature and start-stop behaviour. This paper describes the results from specially developed experimental techniques for testing the MGT in a typical automotive environment. A black box MGT was used in this study for performance investigation during hot and cold starts. The MGT was instrumented and fitted with automotive standard components to replicate typical vehicle operational conditions. The intake air temperature was varied between 10 and 24 \u00b0C. A significant reduction in the power output of the MGT was observed as the intake temperature was increased. The proposed case scenario caused a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions in the range of 0.02\u22120.04 g\/km because of the lower combustion temperature at high intake temperature. However, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions have not shown a noticeable reduction during the power output degradation. The experimental results have highlighted the potential issues of using the MGT at higher intake temperatures and suggest design change to take the effect of higher engine bay temperature into account."

    "abstract": "The reliability of solder joints is a critical issue in the microelectronics industry. The requirement of permanent electrical and thermal connections between solder alloys and the various components of a surface mount device is dependent upon the mechanical integrity of the solder and its interfaces. Accordingly, in this paper, the reliability of lead-free, Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu, and leaded, Sn-37Pb, solder alloys was investigated under both thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) and isothermal mechanical fatigue (IF) conditions. The investigation included material characterisation and fatigue testing on 4-ball grid array (BGA) specimens. The IF tests were carried out under load control at three different temperatures including Room Temperature (RT), 35\u00b0C and 75\u00b0C. Also, a set of \u2018not-in-phase\u2019 (nIP), \u2018in-phase\u2019 (IP) and \u2018out-of-phase\u2019 (OoP) combined thermal and mechanical cycling tests were carried out to investigate the TMF behaviour of the solders. The stress-life curves for each test condition were generated and then compared taking into account the observations on microstructure. It was found that the IF and TMF performance of Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu alloy was better than Sn-37Pb alloy when expressed as stress-life curves. Additionally, the Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu was less susceptible to the changes in temperature. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the reliability of solder alloys under a wide range of loading conditions."

    "abstract": "A Discrete Component Model (DCM) is applied to study the heating and evaporation of suspended kerosene and kerosene surrogate droplets. The effects of natural convection are taken into account using the Churchill approximation, whilst the effects of heat addition from the supporting fibre are modelled using the assumption that heat supplied via the fibre is uniformly distributed within the droplet volume. The results of taking into account and ignoring the above effects are investigated. It is shown that the effect of supporting fibre can be ignored in the analysis of these droplets. In contrast, the effect of natural convection cannot be ignored. The time evolution of droplet radii predicted by the DCM, taking into account the effects of natural convection and supporting fibre, is shown to be close to experimental predictions of this parameter for gas temperatures in the range 500 \u00b0C to 700 \u00b0C. The heating and evaporation of kerosene droplets are compared with those for droplets of various kerosene surrogate fuels, including eleven surrogate fuels proposed in the literature, and two original compositions. Considering the balance between the heating and evaporation characteristics of droplets we conclude that those of the original surrogate SU1 and the modified Utah surrogate are the closest to those of kerosene droplets."

This work is motivated by the recently introduced mechanism of Azanov and Osiptsov (Int J Heat Mass Trans, 106, 1125-1133, 2017) [1]. Two methods of reducing the adiabatic wall temperatures have been proposed. Firstly, a modification to the de Laval nozzle from single to dual and triple supersonic nozzles to reduce the degree of aerodynamic heating at the supersonic channel walls. The latter is conducted with a separation to the supersonic flow regime into three parallel interfacing flow sub-regimes. Secondly, the introduction of water droplets into the supersonic flow channel to absorb the evaporation latent heat equivalent energy. The droplet evaporation has shown a noticeable enhancement in the cooling effects with up to 8\u2103 temperature drops. The model has been compared to the experimental data for compatible results."

Many studies have shown that biomass fuels are sustainable, environmentally friendly and can be the most appropriate replacement to the depleting crude oil. Additionally, they can expand green landscapes, create new job opportunities, be directly utilised in standard power systems and improve combustion performance. Biomass fuels can be limited due to production cost and competition with food. Therefore, plant and food wastes play an important role in reducing these costs and recycling dump bio-materials. Production of biofuels from non-food biomass has emerged as a sustainable option to tackle the problems associated with growing demands for energy."

The contribution of 119 components of E85-diesel fuel blends is taken into account, but replaced with smaller number of components\/quasi-components, under conditions representative of diesel engines. Our results show that high fractions of E85-diesel fuel blends have a significant impact on the evolutions of droplet radii and surface temperatures. For instance, droplet lifetime and surface temperature for a blend of 50 vol. % E85 and 50 vol. % diesel are 23.2% and up to 3.4% less than those of pure diesel fuel, respectively. The application of the MDQD model has improved the computational efficiency significantly with minimal sacrifice to accuracy. This approach leads to a saving of up to 86.4% of CPU time when reducing the 119 components to 16 components\/quasi-components without a sacrifice to the main features of the model."

    "abstract": "The mixing process and flame propagation in GDI engine are greatly influenced by the airflow velocity distribution and the level of turbulence before combustion [1\u20133]. Previous studies (e.g., [4,5]) have shown that optimizing the timing of two successive injection pulses at a moderate-speed moderate-load results in an increase in the cylinder pressure and a reduction in NOx and CO2 emissions. Multiple injections per cylinder increases the temperature for the converter light-off, to achieve a smooth idle and to reduce the tendency to knock [6,7]. In this work a comparison is made between split and single injection during the induction stroke on the cylinder gas velocity, turbulence and mixing process using 3D CFD simulation of CONVERGE CFD software. The simulation is carried out on a single cylinder 4-valve flat piston engine for the prediction of spray formulation, ignition timing, and flame propagation. The injection conditions and spray data used in the simulation are based on experimental data using a typical six-hole GDI injector.  The results show that a split injection leads to improvement in fuel spray droplet dispersion leading to enhancing the uniformity of equivalence ratio in comparison to the single injection condition. The spatial distribution of the equivalence ratio shows richer area with a higher value of equivalence ratio when using single injection. The entrained air and turbulent intensity was relatively enhanced for the split injection case."

    "abstract": "In this work, as well as providing the descriptions on emerging biofuel technologies to mimic the above-mentioned risks, the chemical and thermal properties of biofuels are described. For example, methanol and ethanol are studied as possible alternative liquid fuel candidates to resemble several physical and combustion properties of gasoline. The study shows that such a fuel blend decreases the engine brake power, increases the BSFC, and decreases the CO and HC emissions, compared to those produced using gasoline (fossil) fuel. The pretreated samples are analyzed for mass and energy yields, calorific values, proximate and elemental compositions, and thermal decompositions. This book also provides basic analyses of diesel, gasoline, and various types of biofuels (including biodiesel fuels) and assessment on limited and unlimited emissions (e.g., greenhouse gases, dangerous exhaust gases, and strong carcinogens and their contents) during and after combustion pathways. The results are evaluated in comparison to trusted measurements and numerical standards. The research equipment is adapted with sensitivity measurements to the environmental contamination.A one-dimensional model of gasoline engine is developed for predicting the effect of various fuel types on engine performance, specific fuel consumption, and emissions. The role of microbial consortium-based biocatalyst strategies that are being developed to address these issues are reviewed and discussed. Microbial co-culture biocatalysts are engineered to specialize the conversion of a general class of substrates present in the biomass hydrolysates into biofuel intermediates, with the capability of adapting them to the variable composition of the feedstock. The techniques being developed to understand the interaction between the members of the bioconversion consortia and the corresponding population dynamics of the engineered co-cultures are also presented. The simulation of transesterification requires in-depth understanding of the chemical reactions that take place inside the reactor. The development of reaction mechanism of the multiple step triglyceride, triglycerides, and monoglycerides and their reversal reaction is beyond the interest of chemical or mechanical engineers, whose main interests focus on the assessment of the overall conversion and the established performance process metrics. The work undertakes all relevant activities by establishing and formulating the overall process kinetics, as far as the rate constant and activation energy. The obtained values are used to carry out high fidelity reactive flow of the multiple species, copresent inside the reactor, and otherwise complex to be captured experimentally. Experimental results, high-fidelity numerical results, and parametric sensitivity studies will be introduced and discussed. Through a reaction of alkaline transesterification of biodiesel, several mixtures of diesel-biodiesel and their characteristics are assessed and prepared for tests. For example, kinematic viscosity and high heating value of pure biodiesel (B100), pure diesel, and four biodiesel-diesel fuel blends, B2, B5, B10, and B20, have been determined. B100, diesel, and their blends are used in full-cycle tests of four cylinder engines. A virtual instrumentation technology has been developed and implemented into the test approaches. Such advancement has allowed monitoring (in real time) the parameters of internal combustion engines and presented the versatility, flexibility, scalability, and capacity to function in equipment that operates with different liquid fuels at a lower cost than that of conventional systems. These characteristics represent significant benefit, in comparison to the classical measurement and monitoring approaches, in present market."

    "abstract": "The modelling of heating, evaporation and combustion processes in a combustion system is crucial to its design and advancement [1,2], and essential to the assessment of the suitability of kerosene as an aviation fuel [3]. In this study, we have conducted a detailed analysis of kerosene fuel droplet heating and evaporation, using the previously developed discrete component model (DCM). Kerosene fuel composition (approximated by 44 components of the full composition reported in [4]) is replaced with 2 surrogate components to reduce the computational time. In contrast to the classical industrial analyses of aviation fuel (e.g. the distillation curve method [5]), the DCM takes into account gradients of species mass fractions in droplets. It is based on the analytical solutions to the heat transfer and species diffusion equations subject to appropriate boundary and initial conditions [6]. Numerical codes using these solutions were extensively verified and validated in [7\u20139]. The effective thermal conductivity and effective diffusivity approaches for moving droplets are used in the model. \nThe DCM was implemented in the commercial CFD software of ANSYS-Fluent which was applied to study the processes in a combustor. A polyhedral mesh was used for the hydrodynamic model. This opened opportunities for the simulation of the full combustion cycle. The influence of droplet evaporation on the combustion process was investigated. \nThe analysis was applied to a balanced mixture of kerosene and diesel fuels, represented in the ANSYS-Fluent database by C12H23 and C10H22, respectively. The initial droplet diameter and temperature were 100 \u00b5m and 375 K, respectively. The ambient gas temperature and pressure were 800 K and 4 bar, respectively. A co-axial air-blast atomizer was used with air and fuel mass flowrates of 0.175 kg\/s and 0.003 kg\/s, respectively, and an injection speed of 1 m\/s. The evolution of droplet radii with time was predicted using three approaches, namely: 1) the results predicted by standard ANSYS Fluent software using constant properties; 2) the results predicted by ANSYS Fluent with the implementation of transient properties of fuel composition using the user defined function (udf), but without the DCM; and 3) ANSYS Fluent results with full implementation of the DCM and transient thermodynamic and transport properties.\nThe preliminary results show that the maximal impact of incorporating the DCM into the ANSYS-Fluent prediction of droplet evaporation is up to 10.4% compared to the case when a standard ANSYS-Fluent model is used. Also, our results indicate that the fuel composition and temperature gradient inside droplets, which are ignored in the standard ANSYS Fluent model, can lead to noticeable impact on the spray formation and combustion processes. The new results have been compared with those reported in the literature [12] for kerosene droplets of 1.8 mm initial diameter. General agreement between the numerical results and experimental data was found. In our analyses, we considered the impact of thermal-swelling on droplet evaporation. Finally, the combustion of the blended fuel droplets was simulated, and the influence of fuel evaporation and species diffusion on flame properties was investigated and will be presented in the full paper. \n\nReferences\n[1]\tAl Qubeissi, M., 2018, \u201cPredictions of Droplet Heating and Evaporation: An Application to Biodiesel, Diesel, Gasoline and Blended Fuels,\u201d Applied Thermal Engineering, 136(C), pp. 260\u2013267.\n[2]\tSazhin, S.

    "abstract": "The importance of modeling multi-component fuel atomization, heating and evaporation has been recognized in many studies. The predictions of these models are crucial to the design and performance of combustion engines. Accurate modeling is essential to the understanding of these processes and ultimately to improving engine sustainability and reducing emission. The interest in bio-fossil fuel blends has been mainly stimulated by depletion of fossil fuels and the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that contribute towards climate change. This work presents a review of recent investigations into the heating and evaporation of multi-component blended fuel droplets in real internal combustion engine (ICE) conditions. The models consider the contribution of all groups of hydrocarbons in fossil (gasoline, diesel) fuels, methyl esters in 22 biodiesel fuels, and ethanol fuel. Diffusion of these fuel species, temperature gradient, and recirculation within droplets are accounted for. One important finding is that some fuel blends, for example B5 (5% biodiesel fuel and 95% diesel fuel) and E5 (5% ethanol fuel and 95% gasoline fuel), can give almost identical droplet lifetimes to the ones predicted for pure diesel and gasoline fuels; i.e. such mixtures can be directly used in conventional engines without modification."

    "abstract": "The focus on managing PV panel temperature has undergone a remarkable development in the last two decades. Specifically, in countries with moderate weather temperature and high insolation, the problem of keeping the PV cell temperature in an optimal range has been managed by use of PV\/T collectors. In this work, a single pass PV\/T collector using laminar air flow has been assessed. Two PV\/T collector designs are utilised, one with and one without offset strip fins. COMSOL Multiphysics v5.3a has been used for the analysis of the thermal and electrical performances. Two assumptions were implemented in order to reduce the computational time from 95 hours to 7 hours, namely ignoring radiative effects between the fins and the wall channels, and representing thin layers as 2D boundaries, whilst ensuring a high level of conformity (4%),. Monocrystalline silicon PV cells were used with a power temperature coefficient of 0.41%. A validation against work in the literature was made, showing a good consistency. The objective of this work is to verify the performance of the air PV\/T collector with offset strip fins compared to an unfinned air PV\/T collector. The results reveal that the use of offset strip fins has a noticeable impact on both the electrical and thermal efficiencies of the system. In addition, the maximum combined efficiency (\u03b7Co) for the finned PV\/T system is 84.7% while the unfinned PV\/T system is 51.2%."

    "abstract": "Recently, much emphasis has been placed on improving the efficiency of solar systems with co-generation as a particularly promising research area. This work focuses on the integration of photovoltaic (PV) and solar air heater systems with the aim to evaluate electrical and thermo-hydraulic performances. Five air PV\/Thermal collector designs are investigated numerically. These designs are classified based on the direction of flow and number of passes. The first design model is a single duct single pass, in which air flows underneath the PV panel and the upper surface of PV subject to ambient conditions. The second is similar to the first one, but with an air gap added between the upper surface of the PV module and glass cover. In the third, air flows under and over the surfaces of the PV module in the same direction. The fourth is similar to the third one, but the flow pathways are in opposite direction. In the fifth, air flows between the glass cover and the PV module and reverses in the second pass between the PV panel and lower absorber plate, making a U-shape flow. The fifth model displays the best thermal performance whilst the third offers the highest electrical efficiency."

The effects of ambient conditions (ambient pressure, ambient temperature and radiative temperature), and ethanol\/gasoline fuel blend ratios on multi-component fuel droplet heating and evaporation are investigated using the analytical solutions to the heat transfer and species diffusion equations. The ambient pressures, gas and radiative temperatures, and ethanol\/gasoline fuel ratios are considered in the ranges 3\u201330 bar, 400\u2013650 K, 1000\u20132000 K, and 0% (pure gasoline)\u2013100% (pure ethanol), respectively. Transient diffusion of 21 hydrocarbons, temperature gradient, and recirculation inside droplets are accounted for using the Discrete Component model. The droplet lifetimes of all mixtures decrease at high ambient temperatures (>400 K), under all ambient pressures (3\u201330 bar). The combination of ethanol and gasoline fuels has a noticeable impact on droplet heating and evaporation; for pure ethanol, the predicted droplet surface temperature is 24.3% lower, and lifetime 33.9% higher, than that for gasoline fuel under the same conditions. Finally, taking into account radiation decreases the gasoline fuel droplet evaporation times by up to 28.6%, and those of ethanol fuel droplets by up to 21.8%, compared to the cases where radiation is ignored."

This model is based on the previously developed version of the Discrete Component model (DCM), using the analytical solution to heat transfer and species diffusion equations inside droplets. The universal quasi-chemical functional group activity coefficients (UNIFAC) model is used to predict the activity coefficient for the components of diesel and gasoline fuels. It is found that the droplet evaporation time and surface temperature predicted for these fuels show noticeable differences from those estimated using the conventional DCM in literature. The results indicate that the use of the classical DCM approach can expose the estimation of droplet lifetime to errors of up to 4% for diesel fuel and 2.6% for gasoline, compared to the predictions of the same model using the proposed correction."

The analyses are made considering conditions representative of real internal combustion engines. The evolutions of droplet radii and temperatures for gasoline, diesel, and a broad range of biodiesel fuels and their selective diesel fuel blends have been predicted using the Discrete Component model (DCM). These mixtures are combined with up to 116 components of 98 hydrocarbons and 4-18 methyl esters. The results are compared with the predictions of the case when blended biodiesel\/diesel fuel are represented by pure fossil and biodiesel fuels. In contrast to previous studies, it is shown that droplet evaporation time and surface temperature predicted for 100% biodiesel are not always close to those predicted for pure diesel fuel, but they are entirely dependent on the biodiesel fuel composition. Also, the previously introduced multi-dimensional quasi-discrete model and its application to the aforementioned fuels are discussed. The application of the latter model contributes to improving the CPU efficiency with up to 96% in computational time compared to the original approach (the DCM), with a minimal loss in the accuracy of the model predictions."

Using an Egyptian public sector urban development organisation and its sustainable energy project as an empirical example, interviews, documents and observations were collected.FindingsThe dynamics emerged between field urban development projects and the (unintended) organisational implementation of the performance measurement system, the sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) reporting system. Contributing to previous literature, these dynamics have been institutionalised through (three) interrelated levels: the (macro-field) urban development contingencies and pressures for sustainability KPIs reporting, the (organisational) institutionalisation of the urban development performance measurement system and then the (micro-organisational) cognitive role of sustainability KPIs reports in (re)making political urban development decisions.Research limitations\/implicationsThis study faced some limitations that paved the way for future research axes. For political and security reasons, difficulties were encountered in conducting interviews with government actors in the sustainable energy project under study. Also, due to the practical separation of the environmental sustainability system from the sustainability KPIs reporting system in this case study, environmental sustainability is outside the scope.Practical implicationsSustainability reports may influence public sector decision-making processes in a specific urban development context. These KPIs reports may also increase public sector management opportunities for urban auditing, transparency, accountability and sustainability governance. These KPIs may also guide public sector management to lower prices in poor villages to increase smart energy consumption and improve community health.Social implicationsSustainability reports may increase decision-makers' understanding of consumer behaviours and societal changes. This may help in making appropriate political decisions to improve their welfare and regular smart energy consumption. Not only urban citizens, but this social advantage may also extend to urban development employees through employees' promotion, training and access to government-funded academic and professional scholarships.Originality\/valueThis study is an attempt to develop current public sector performance measurement analyses in the emerging urban development field using a triadic analytical approach. This study also fed the literature with an extended case study that clarified the (multi-level) and (two-way) dynamics between performance measurement and urban development."

Design\/methodology\/approach: This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city. Findings: Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP) network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the sustainable city as an \u201caccounting city\u201d (which appeared rhetorically as a \u201csmart city\u201d). \u201cSmart\u201d being the visibility and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the ERP-enabled electricity distribution. Research limitations\/implications: This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and identifies the accounting community\u2019s need for multiple and comparative case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management accounting systems. Practical implications: City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing and monitoring smart city projects and objectives. Social implications: Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and increased political, field and organisational sustainability. Originality\/value: This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms. The achievement of sustainability management accounting systems has connected to multiple ERP roles at different institutional levels, which resulted in accommodating the socio-political objectives of smart city projects."

Design\/methodology\/approach: This study extends the application and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous management accounting literature on the potential relationship between performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings: Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics, arising from political and military pressures towards public-private collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping political decisions and military actions in the city council. Originality\/value: Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in smart city decision-making and governance. Empirically, it enriches previous literature with a case study of a developing Arab Spring country, characterised by an emerging economy, political sensitivity and military engagement, rather than developed and more stable countries that have been thoroughly investigated. It is also among the first politically engaged accounting case studies to highlight public-private collaborations as a recent reform in public sector governance and accountability."

It answers the research question: how accounting-based key performance indicators (KPIs) were chosen within a privatised SE to maintain co-existence between two different institutional logics, the social and commercial logics, to gain legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study expands the application and contribution of the Besharov and Smith\u2019s (2014) logics multiplicity framework to previous management accounting literature on PMS and institutional logics. It adds a new dimension to previous literature to theorise the cognitive dynamics of institutional logics at three distinct but interrelated institutional levels, namely, field, organisational and individual. Data come from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SE, involved in implementing a social project (drinking water refining) in rural communities. Findings: PMS acts as a political tool through which the privatised case company has gained societal acceptance and legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Its non-political KPIs have turned into political tools to meet the institutional demands of the funding scheme. This government involvement represents field-level institutional logics, which influenced the organisational-level interplay of commercial and social logics and then the individual-level choice of internal KPIs. This contributes to the fact that institutional logics and their interplay between these three levels are \u201cin a state of flux\u201d within SEs\u2019 internal PMS. Originality\/value: This study deals with a real-life practical case that proves the prevalence of one institutional logic over another at both the organisational and individual levels may be occasioned by organisational field pressures and opportunities rather than by other intra-organisational conflicts as discussed in most previous literature on PMS and institutional logics."

The role of accounting as a tool of governance in smart city politics, however, has so far been largely overlooked, especially in less developed countries (LDCs). This paper sets off to fill this research gap and hitherto unexplored linkages between accounting and smart cities. Drawing on the concept of governmentality, the authors conducted a case study based on document analysis, meetings observation, and 42 semi-structured interviews at a branch of a hybrid electricity company owned by New Cairo City in Egypt, during 2018. Findings show that the case company has implemented smart distribution networks of electricity in which new management accounting technology (enterprise resource planning (ERP) system) is used to trace costs, revenues, client complaints and feedback in a timely manner. The new network (of infrastructure and technologies) has represented timely accounting information as a major political power to influence accurate governance decision-making, such as smart electricity pricing and control, and to challenge governance decisions that are not sound. This paper is one of the first studies to explore the socio-political dynamics of accounting in smart city governance in the context of LDCs."

Data was gathered through document analysis, interviews, meetings observations and continuous interactions with key informants from 2013 to 2014. The findings show that the implementation of cost management strategies had a political basis, grounded in the state\u2019s reformative ideologies concerning re-privatisation of the public sector organisation. The re-privatisation failed because the state failed to convince a potential international investor. A theoretical contribution is to show the relevance of cost management strategies when used as a political tool to achieve a business goal, such as improving a public sector organisation\u2019s performance management in a developing country. This is the first empirical case study to analyse management accounting change based on the state\u2019s political ideologies in the Maghreb region of Africa.

The intervehicular distance and the BER performance vary widely between different lanes and different periods of the day. The results also show that the BER performance of V2V-VLC system with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) component and with LOS component are comparable at rush hours.

Three models (Lambertian, Gaussian, and empirical) are utilized to examine the impact of vehicles headlights radiation pattern on the statistical path loss of VVLC system. The analytical model of channel path loss is validated by Monte Carlo simulation with the headlight model simulated with a raytracing software. The path loss values of the Gaussian model differ by 2 dB compared to the Lambertian model, irrespective of the traffic conditions while it differs by 24.6 dB during late night and 8.15 dB during rush hours compared to the empirical model of a Toyota Altis headlight. This variation shows that the radiation intensity distribution should be modelled for each vehicle's headlights from each manufacturer to ensure accurate VVLC channel model. The proposed Gaussian model provides a close approximation to describe such radiation pattern and can easily be adapted to model for different manufacturers' headlights."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a statistical channel model for dynamic vehicular visible light communication systems. The proposed model considers the effect of variation in inter-vehicular spacing and the geometrical changes on path loss of the channel. The study also considers different weather conditions and vehicle mobility based on a realistic traffic flow model that considers traffic density during different times of the day. Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the obtained statistical model for different transmission scenarios. In addition, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the statistical model and Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to verify that they represent the same distribution. The results show that the channel statistical distribution varies with the traffic flow and inter-vehicular spacing, which changes at different times of the day. The results also show that the path loss values of the non-line-of-sight component are significantly larger than the path loss values of the line-of-sight component of the channel when a single reflector is considered. However, at rush hours, when inter-vehicle spacing becomes shorter, the path loss value of multiple reflections decreases significantly."

The results show that at high-density traffic, larger number of multipath components are received with higher amplitude and lower propagation delay than the multipath components received at low-density traffic. The results also show that the VVLC channel is time-variant nonstationary with flat and slow fading, at high-density traffic.

We propose to extend the application of minimax filtering from state estimation in the radio frequency (RF) domain to intruder tracking using VLC. The performance of the proposed method was examined and compared with Kalman filter for both VLC and RF. The simulation results showed that the minimax filter provided marginally better tracking and was more robust to the adversary behavior of the intruder than Kalman filter, with less than 0.5 cm estimation error. In addition, minimax was significantly better than Kalman filter for RF tracking applications."

Due to the lack of a realistic channel model that takes the vehicles mobility and the light propagation nature into consideration, we propose a regular-shaped geometry based stochastic channel model (RSGBSM). Particularly, we suggest the ellipse shape to describe the line of sight (LOS) and the reflection components of the VVLC. This approach offers flexibility to describe vehicles locations, speed and direction as well as stationary and non-stationary reflectors which are changing rapidly and continuously. The simulation results demonstrate that the LOS channel component is more affected by the direction of motion than the reflection component, whereas the reflection component is more affected by the relative speed of the vehicles."

A convenience sample of male (n = 16) and female (n = 20) university students performed maximal isometric contractions for flexion (Flex), extension (Ext), left- (LSF) and right-side flexion (RSF) in a quadruped position over three sessions. The intra-rater reliability results were good-to-excellent for both males (ICC = 0.83\u20130.90) and females (ICC = 0.86\u20130.94) and acceptable (CV < 15%) across all directions for both males and females. The inter-rater reliability results were excellent (ICC = 0.96\u20130.97) and acceptable (CV < 11.1%) across all directions. Findings demonstrated a significant effect for sex (p \u2264 0.05): males were stronger in all four directions, and a significant effect for direction (p \u2264 0.05): Ext tested stronger (193 N) than Flex (176 N), LSF (130 N) and RSF (125 N). The findings show that the VALD fixed frame dynamometer can reliably assess isometric neck strength and can provides reference values for healthy males and females."

    "abstract": "A number of studies have examined the occurrence of stories in lecture contexts, and have suggested that stories can encourage student engagement and the acquisition and retention of lecture information content. Some of these studies have analysed story structures in terms of Labov and Waletzky\u2019s model (1967) or the more elaborate model developed by Martin (2008). Such models work well for stories that recount events that took place in past time, but they do not capture another type of story, the hypothetical scenario, sufficiently well. Drawing on prior research into stories in lecture discourse, and \u2018Imagining Scenarios\u2019 (\u00c4del 2010, 2012), we identify and describe passages in lectures where listeners are invited to imagine a fantastic hypothetical situation. Scenario identification criteria were developed, and examples were extracted from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus, the Engineering Lecture Corpus (ELC), and the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE). Novice EMI lecturers may understandably be nervous about straying away from the delivery of facts and into the realms of fantasy, but our findings suggest that scenario-telling is part of the experienced lecturer\u2019s repertoire, and is an engaging way of elaborating abstract technical terms, concepts, or arguments central to a disciplinary topic."

Corpus linguistic approaches enable examination of large bodies of language data based on computing power. These bodies of data, or corpora, facilitate investigation of the meaning of words in context. The semi-automated nature of such investigation helps researchers to identify and interpret language patterns that might otherwise be inaccessible through manual analysis. We illustrate potential uses of corpus linguistic approaches through four short case studies by higher education researchers, spanning educational contexts, disciplines and genres. These case studies are underpinned by discussion of the development of corpus linguistics as a field of investigation, including existing open corpora and corpus analysis tools. We give a flavour of how corpus linguistic techniques, in isolation or as part of a wider research approach, can be particularly helpful to higher education researchers who wish to investigate language data and its context."

    "abstract": "Strand: AssessmentProposal category: Expansion studyAttainment disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and White students is an ongoing concern within the higher education (HE) sector, and more widely within society. Recent investigation of student degree outcomes in the UK indicates that this disparity, whereby White students are awarded higher degree qualifications than BAME students, at its starkest sits at around 20% nationwide (OfS 2018). This gap in academic outcomes increases during the HE journey of these particular student populations, despite sector-wide recognition of systemic inequality (UUK and NUS 2019).Our work therefore seeks to better understand institutional practices and policies that may contribute to this ethnic attainment disparity. We specifically attempt to unpick the ways in which the \u2018written feedback information\u2019 (Boud 2013) that students receive may be connected to their degree award outcomes. This focus has two main drivers: 1. written feedback information given to assessed work is one of the main channels through which lecturers engage formally with individual students, throughout students\u2019 HE journey, and 2. students at local and national levels have voiced ongoing dissatisfaction with feedback and assessment practices, disproportionate to other satisfaction indicators (e.g. National Student Survey results (OfS 2019)).We previously looked at whether differences in the nature of written feedback information can be differentiated according to the variable of discipline, for which we developed a framework of feedback functions (Alsop and Gardner 2019). This framework is comprised of five main functions (\u2018advice\u2019, \u2018critique\u2019, \u2018observation\u2019, \u2018praise\u2019, \u2018query\u2019) and a catchall \u2018unclassified\u2019 option. Each function is subdivided three times, firstly by focus (e.g. \u2018advice\u2019 splits into \u2018suggestion\u2019 and \u2018instruction\u2019), then by orientation (\u2018specific\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019), and then by aspect (\u2018future\u2019 or \u2018present\u2019). We found that it was possible to differentiate the nature of the written feedback information received by individual students based on the variable of discipline.In this paper, we explore further whether we can use this framework as a starting point to investigate whether a relationship exists between students\u2019 ethnicity and language patterns within the written feedback information they receive. To do so, we applied our framework to 50 texts written to students from different ethnic backgrounds within a single discipline in a post-92 HE institution in the UK. Each file in the small corpus includes the feedback text written by the instructor to the student, and also metadata information about that student. Metadata variables include socioeconomic information (such as \u2018ethnicity\u2019, \u2018gender\u2019, and \u2018home postcode\u2019) and academic information (such as \u2018assignment grade\u2019, \u2018discipline\u2019, and \u2018level of study\u2019). The variable of ethnicity is self-identified when students apply to HE institutions in the UK (see HESA 2018). After manually encoding all texts, using individual comments as the unit of analysis, we looked at the relationship between students\u2019 ethnicity, grade attained, and the language of the written feedback that they receive.We will discuss findings from the analysis of this small dataset. Preliminary results indicate that little differentiation is evident in terms of the categorisation of written feedback information at the highest level of overall function in relation to binary categories of self-identified ethnicity (BAME and White). A more granular investigation of feedback function at the level of focus and orientation indicates some differentiation in the language of the feedback written to White and BAME student populations. Further differentiation is evident in the language of written feedback information at the level of overall function between the distinct ethnic populations that comprise the broad BAME category. Overall, there is greater differentiation in the language of written feedback information at the level of particular functions within BAME populations than between White and BAME populations.As part of a wider research project, what this stage of analysis confirms is the importance of granularity when investigating institutional practices and student academic outcomes. In the context of the ethnic attainment gap, we do not propose a direct causal relationship between the language of written feedback information and student ethnicity, but rather suggest that written feedback information may constitute one means by which certain (already disadvantaged) groups of students are further, and cumulatively, disengaged by higher education practices.Analysis also resulted in minor amendments to the 2019 working feedback framework; we added \u2018neutral\u2019 as a branch of the aspect attribute, alongside \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019. This amendment is intended to capture more finely lecturer intention so that we can later compare this to student perceptions, which we anticipate will be a productive gap to explore.This small study gives us confidence to progress to the next stage in our broader research project, which is to extend both the scale of the corpus and also the method of analysis to include investigation of the intersection of impacting variables.ReferencesBoud, D.

    "abstract": "Background: Disparity of attainment between different groups of students in UK higher education has been correlated with ethnicity (UUK & NUS, 2019). For example, students who declared their ethnicity as Black were 20% less likely to graduate with a top classification than those who declared their ethnicity as White (OfS, 2018a). The causes of such attainment gaps are complex, and one important factor may be the nature of the feedback given by academic staff on assignments written by different groups of students. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of investigating this hypothesis by analyzing written feedback and looking for patterns in feedback given to different groups of students. Literature Review: Research on attainment among Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students in the UK has explored a number of aspects, and has generally concluded that there are issues of \u201cbelonging\u201d (Richardson, 2015), particularly in institutions where the majority of academic staff and students are White, but that no single variable can explain the disparity. The wording of feedback on lower-scoring papers has been shown to be more impersonal and distant than that given to students on higher-scoring papers (e.g., Gardner, 2004), which has the (unintended) result of increasing the sense of belonging of higher performing students in ways that can build incrementally over the years of a degree course. While there have been many such small-scale studies of written feedback, none have aimed to collect large quantities of authentic written feedback for analysis. \nResearch Questions: The hypotheses that\u202fdrive our exploration are that\u202fwritten feedback information (WFI) (Boud & Malloy, 2013) is\u202fworded differently to different groups of students, and that there is a direct relationship between this aspect of feedback and academic attainment as measured by grades on summative assessments. Specifically, we asked: \n1.\tCan a framework of WFI functions be developed for our data that share a meaningful set of attributes? \n2.\tCan these categories be used to differentiate WFI to different groups of students?\nMethodology: A small pilot corpus was compiled from written feedback comments on twelve student assignments from two large Faculties. Metadata was added to each file, and the WFI comments were annotated and analyzed according to a framework developed in a branching format through a recursive construction process informed by the literature reviewed and the data in the corpus. This technique was used to characterize the WFI styles of the two Faculties. \nResults: The results show that all WFI comments could be classified using the novel systematic framework developed, and that its binary nature enabled ready cross-tabulation with metadata variables. Praise and critique were found to be most frequent, with specific praise of ideas (P1A) accounting for 68% of all praise, and specific critique of content (C1A) accounting for 49% of all critique. Observations tend to be the longest feedback comments (average 15.4 words). When the two Faculties are compared, two different feedback styles are evident, with Fac1 providing more advice, query, and observation style feedback than Fac2, and Fac2 providing more praise and critique than Fac1."

    "abstract": "Humour is one of the most difficult pragmatic devices for lecturers and students to engage with, and for researchers to identify systematically. Humour does not always travel well across cultures. It can cause particular problems of miscommunication for the lecturers delivering and for those students receiving it in unfamiliar cultural contexts. This paper demonstrates the use of pragmatic annotation for mapping the distribution, duration, and specific function of humour based on nine attributed types. The analysis looks at 76 English-medium lectures from the UK, Malaysia, and New Zealand, which form part of the Engineering Lecture Corpus. Differences in preferred humour type, amount, and laughter response rate are evident across the three cultural subcorpora. In the increasingly globalized academic setting, understanding of such cultural differences is important to all academics and students on the move."

In many other academic genres, however, there is greater variation in the purpose and structure of introductory sections. Even if they all function to \u2018introduce the academic work\u2019 (Bhatia 1997: 182), practitioners do not necessarily agree about their generic features. Nesi and Gardner (2012: 98) found considerable variation in the role of introductions in student essays, for example, and Bhatia\u2019s informants disagreed about the distinctions between introductions, prefaces and forewords to academic books (1997: 183)."

    "abstract": "This paper will describe a process of \u2018pragmatic annotation\u2019 (c.f. Simpson-Vlach and Leicher 2006) which systematically identifies pragmatic meaning in spoken text. The annotation of stretches of text that perform particular pragmatic functions allows conclusions to be drawn across data sets at a different level than that of the individual lexical item, or structural content. The annotation of linguistic features, which cannot be identified by purely objective means, is distinguished here from structural mark-up of speaker identity, turns, pauses etc. The features annotated are \u2018explaining\u2019, \u2018housekeeping\u2019, \u2018humour\u2019, \u2018storytelling\u2019 and \u2018summarising\u2019. Twenty-two subcategories are attributed to these elements. Data is from the Engineering Lecture Corpus (ELC), which includes 76 English-medium engineering lectures from the UK, New Zealand and Malaysia. The annotation allows us to compare differences in the use of these discourse features across cultural subcorpora. Results show that cultural context does impact on the linguistic realisation of commonly occurring discourse features in engineering lectures."

    "abstract": "The Engineering Lecture Corpus (ELC) is a growing corpus of English-medium lectures from across the world, currently including transcripts from Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand and the UK (www.coventry.ac.uk\/elc). Unusually, the ELC encodes functions that recur across large numbers of transcripts, using what we call \u2018pragmatic annotation\u2019. Recurrent functions in ELC transcripts have been found to include \u2018storytelling\u2019, \u2018housekeeping\u2019, \u2018summarizing\u2019 and \u2018defining\u2019. Sub-categories have been assigned to some of these functions; for example storytelling is marked as either an \u2018anecdote\u2019, \u2018exemplum\u2019, \u2018narrative\u2019 or \u2018recount\u2019 (cf. Martin 2008).\n The paper argues that although engineering lecturers around the world may use a common language to deliver the same kind of syllabus for the same broad purpose, engineering lectures are likely to remain both context- and culture-specific. Lectures of all kinds often include story elements, to entertain, instruct, and make key information more memorable. The way stories are presented varies from place to place, however, and this may represent a challenge both to those who attend lectures and to those who deliver them. Such variation should be taken into account when designing ESP and staff development programmes. \n This paper looks at the purposes of storytelling in Engineering lectures, and the ways in which various types of stories are realized linguistically. The discussion draws on Labov and Waletzky\u2019s structural model for oral narratives of personal experience (1967), and Martin\u2019s four categories of Story (2008)."

The majority of the contributors to the corpus are mother tongue speakers of English, but, in order to be included in the corpus, each assignment had to be judged proficient by assessors in the contributor's discipline, regardless of the writer's mother tongue. The corpus contains, therefore, only texts that have met departmental requirements for the given level of study. University writing programmes are typically aimed at undergraduate and Master's students, and it would be useful for writing tutors to know more about student assignment genres and the linguistic features of successful writing at undergraduate and Master's level. However, most large-scale descriptive studies of academic writing focus on published or publicly accessible texts, or learner essays on general academic topics, probably because there are practical difficulties associated with collecting large amounts of well-documented student output. This paper charts the experience of collecting data for the BAWE corpus, highlighting the problems we encountered and the solutions we chose, with a view to facilitating the task of future developers of academic student writing corpora"

    "abstract": "Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been widely used to describe the electrical dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. A high model accuracy is important for effective simulation and control of the battery system. The model accuracy depends on the design of experiment (DoE) method for battery test and the optimisation approach for ECM parameter identification. While many optimisation approaches have been proposed in literature to identify the parameters, the effect of DoE on the model accuracy is usually overlooked and undervalued. A novel DoE method is proposed in this paper which uses both partial discharge test (PDT) and deep discharge test (DDT) for battery testing. It is shown through careful test data analysis that, the conventional DoE methods using either PDT or DDT cannot capture the battery's dynamics to sufficient accuracy. Experimental data are collected using a commercial lithium ion battery. Results show the new DoE method can significant improve the ECM accuracy, i.e., reducing the root mean square error by ~70% in comparison with conventional DoE approach. In addition, the improved model accuracy contributes to a significant increase in the SoC estimation accuracy using extended Kalman filter."

Nonlinear frequency response analysis (NFRA) has recently been demonstrated as a means to determine SOH, but the effects of temperature and state-of-charge (SOC) on battery NFRA measurements are not yet well understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of SOC on NFRA measurements performed on commercial 21700 cylindrical cells aged under different temperatures to various SOHs. Total harmonic distortion (THD%) is proposed as a capacity fade indicator. THD% in the range of 10 Hz\u2013150 Hz are found to correlate well with SOH at all SOCs. For frequency < 1 Hz, the effect of aging on THD% is SOC dependent, with larger THDs for the new cell at low open-circuit voltages (OCVs) (2.75 V\u20133.2 V), and larger THDs for aged cells at higher OCVs (3.5 V\u20134.1 V). This work also demonstrates the feasibility of NFRA to distinguish between cells that have been aged differently based on temperature."

    "abstract": "Efficient management through monitoring of Li-ion batteries is critical to the progress of electro-mobility and energy storage globally, since the technology can be hazardous if pushed beyond its safety boundaries. Battery management systems (BMSs) are being actively improved to reduce size, weight, and cost while increasing their capabilities. Using power line communication, wireless monitoring, or hybrid data links are one of the most advanced research directions today. In this work, we propose the use of radio frequency (RF) transceivers as a communication unit that can deliver both wired and wireless services, through their superior analog and digital signal processing capability compared to PLC technology. To validate our approach computational simulation and empirical evaluation was conducted to examine the possibility of using RF transceivers on a direct current (DC) bus for wired BMS. A key advantage of this study is that it proposes a flexible and tested system for communication across a variety of network scenarios, where wireless data links over disrupted connections may be enabled by using this technology in short-range wired modes. This investigation demonstrates that the IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceivers with operating frequencies of 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz can establish stable data links on a DC bus via capacitive coupling at high data rates."

The focus is to determine, via statistical tools including correlation coefficient (CC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and feature selective validation (FSV) method, the impedance and signal change impact on a possible communication link when fully charged cells are present or completely missing from the bus. Moreover, to establish if technological differences may be accounted for during the empirical experiments, Li-ion cells from two different manufacturers were selected and connected via three subsequent capacitive couplings of 1 \u00b5F, 1 nF and 1 pF. According to a methodical comparison by employing CC, RMSE, and FSV over the measured impedance and signal attenuation, this study has shown that the physical DC network is the dominant impedance at high frequencies and that the signal attenuation on the DC line supports communication in the investigated spectrum. The reported findings are critical for in situ hybrid PLC and wireless communication implementation of BMS for Li-ion systems supported through only one RF transceiver."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly common in high-power, safety-critical applications such as aerospace, spaceflight, automotive and grid storage. The voltage and power specifications of such applications usually require large numbers of individual cells combined in series and parallel to form a battery pack. It is then the role of the Battery Management System (BMS) to monitor these cells condition and ensure they remain within safe operating limits. To minimise cost and complexity, it is typical to monitor only a fraction of the cells in a battery pack. This creates potential safety and reliability issues and requires conservative limits imposed on the overall system to ensure safe operation. This is insufficient in high-power, safety-critical applications and thus alternative approaches to battery management are required. Here we demonstrate the development of novel miniature electronic devices for incorporation in-situ at a cell-level during manufacture. This approach enables local cell-to-cell and cell-to-BMS data communication of sensor data without the need for additional wiring infostructure within a battery module assembly. The electronics firmware and hardware integration within the cell\u2019s electrode stack is demonstrated to function after triggering post cell formation and through cycling and electrochemical impedance analysis. This work shows that the proposed approach has a negligible impact on the cells\u2019 performance and highlights a new technique for active monitoring of the cell\u2019s in-situ conditions. This research will enable new methods of cells characterization and monitoring for optimum electrochemical and thermal performance while improving system safety."

    "abstract": "As the drive to improve the cost, performance characteristics and safety of lithium-ion batteries increases with adoption, one area where significant value could be added is that of battery diagnostics. This paper documents an investigation into the use of plasmonic-based optical fibre sensors, inserted internally into 1.4 Ah lithium-ion pouch cells, as a real time and in-situ diagnostic technique. The successful implementation of the fibres inside pouch cells is detailed and promising correlation with battery state is reported, while having negligible impact on cell performance in terms of capacity and columbic efficiency. The testing carried out includes standard cycling and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests, and the use of a reference electrode to correlate with the anode and cathode readings separately. Further observations are made around the sensor and analyte interaction mechanisms, robustness of sensors and suggested further developments. These finding show that a plasmonic-based optical fibre sensor may have potential as an opto-electrochemical diagnostic technique for lithium-ion batteries, offering an unprecedented view into internal cell phenomena."

    "abstract": "Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been widely used for capturing the electrical behaviour of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, one limitation of the conventional full-cell level ECM is that it cannot capture the battery's internal states at half-cell level, e.g., the negative electrode (NE) potential. Real-time monitoring of NE potential is highly desirable for improving battery performance and safety, as it can prevent lithium plating which occurs when the NE potential drops below a threshold value. This paper proposes an easy-to-implement framework for real-time estimation of the NE potential of LIBs. An ECM at half-cell level is developed and parametrised by a bespoke experimental method, exemplified on a commercial 21700 LIB cell. The cell is instrumented with a lithium reference electrode that enables direct measurement of the per-electrode potential. Based on the developed model, an extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the battery's NE potential and SoC in real-time using only onboard available signals including the terminal current and voltage. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high modelling and estimation accuracy. The root mean square error of the real-time NE potential estimation is below 8\u00a0mV. The low computational complexity of the developed algorithm can facilitate practical implementation in commercial BMS."

The experimental tests are carried out using two generic unturned radiative structures, a wire loop fitted inside a cell shell, and an open terminal sub miniature version A (SMA), subsequently oriented vertically and horizontally relative to the ground plane. Based on signal strength indicator, bit error rate, and packet error rate, the test characterized a payload of 120 bytes at the highest speed of 150 kbps and 250 kbps supported by the IEEE 802.15.4 for the two communication frequencies. A MATLAB simulation is used in parallel to determine the three-dimensional radiative pattern of the two structures, whereas a three-ray model for multipath range propagation is implemented to complete the empirical experiments. It was demonstrated through testing communication of up to 10 m for both operating frequencies, proving the concept of wireless cell communication within short ranges, an essential feature for monitoring the health of each cell inside future electric vehicles (EVs)."

However, NMC811 features relatively poor structural and thermal stabilities, which affect its cycle life. This study aims to address the limited data availability research gap on NMC811 low-temperature degradation. We aged commercial 21700 NMC811 cells at 0 \u00b0C under 0.5 C and 1 C current rates. After 200 cycles, post-mortem visual, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the inspections of harvested electrodes were conducted. In just 200 cold cycles, capacity drops of 25% and 49% were observed in cells aged at 1 C and 0.5 C, respectively. The fast degradation at low temperatures is largely due to lithium plating at the anode side during the charging process. The surprisingly better performance at 1 C is related to enhanced cell self-heating. After subsequent 3-month storage, the cells that experienced 200 cycles at 0 \u00b0C and 0.5 C became faulty (voltage: \u2248 0 V), possibly due to cell lithium dendrites and micro short circuits. This work demonstrates that NMC811 suffers from poor cold ageing performance and subsequent premature end-of-life."

Particularly important for this purpose is the prediction of the internal temperature of cells, because of the positive feedback between heat generation and current distribution. In this work, a comprehensive electro-thermal model is developed for a cylindrical lithium-ion cell. The model is comprehensively parameterized and validated with experimental data for 2170 cylindrical cells (LG M50T, NMC811), including direct core temperature measurements. The validated model is used to study different cell designs and cooling approaches and their effects on the internal temperature of the cell. Increasing the number of tabs connecting the jellyroll to the base of the cylindrical-can reduces the internal thermal gradient by up to 25.41%. On its own, side cooling is more effective than base cooling at removing heat, yet both result in thermal gradients within the cell of a similar magnitude, irrespective of the number of cell tabs. The results are of immediate interest to both cell manufacturers and battery pack designers, while the modelling and parameterization framework created is an essential tool for energy storage system design."

    "abstract": "Adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) is widely used for lithium-ion battery (LIBs) state of charge (SOC) estimation. Innovation covariance matrix (ICM) of AEKF is estimated by fixed-length error innovation sequence (EIS) (the difference between measured and estimated voltages), which doesn't consider the distribution change of EIS. However, the distribution of EIS will change due to load current dynamics or error of battery model. Failing to consider the distribution change of EIS will lead to SOC estimation inaccuracy. To address this problem, this paper proposed an intelligent adaptive extended Kalman filter (IAEKF) method that can detect the moment of distribution change of EIS by the maximum likelihood function. Then, the ICM is updated based on the EIS after that moment to improve the SOC estimation accuracy. Results show that the proposed IAEKF method improves SOC estimation accuracy. Compared to that of the AEKF, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of SOC based on IAEKF decrease significantly by 43.34% and 55.80%, respectively, while the computation time only increases by 4.59%. In the end, the effect of initial parameters on the SOC estimation accuracy was analysed. It is found that the proposed IAEKF method is robust against parameter uncertainties."

    "abstract": "Identification of the state-of-health (SoH) of Li-ion cells is a vital tool to protect operating battery packs against accelerated degradation and failure. This is becoming increasingly important as the energy and power densities demanded by batteries and the economic costs of packs increase. Here, ultrasonic time-of-flight analysis is performed to demonstrate the technique as a tool for the identification of a range of defects and SoH in Li-ion cells. Analysis of large, purpose-built defects across multiple length scales is performed in pouch cells. The technique is then demonstrated to detect a microscale defect in a commercial cell, which is validated by examining the acoustic transmission signal through the cell. The location and scale of the defects are confirmed using X-ray computed tomography, which also provides information pertaining to the layered structure of the cells. The demonstration of this technique as a methodology for obtaining direct, non-destructive, depth-resolved measurements of the condition of electrode layers highlights the potential application of acoustic methods in real-time diagnostics for SoH monitoring and manufacturing processes."

    "date": "1 Sept 2019",
    "abstract": "Lithium plating significantly reduces the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries and may even pose a safety risk in the form of an internal short circuit, leading to catastrophic cell failure. Low temperatures, high charge currents and battery age are known to be contributing factors to increased lithium plating. To reduce or avoid battery ageing induced by lithium plating, a method for lithium plating detection is essential to help understand the favourable conditions under which battery charging is optimised. In this study, we present a concept to design an experiment-based approach to improve lithium plating detection sensitivity using the non-destructive voltage relaxation analysis method. Commercial NCA\/graphite cells are employed for this study. Here, the reversible part of the plated lithium providing a unique cell voltage relaxation profile is used as a pseudo-measure to detect the onset of plating. This profile is observed while the cell is at rest as well as under a low C-rate discharge regime immediately after charging. It is found that the CV (Constant Voltage) phase cut-off current value significantly influences plating detection. To address this issue, a procedure to determine the optimal cut-off current in the CV phase of charging is introduced to improve the detection sensitivity. With the proposed method, plating detection chances are improved which will help in understanding the favourable conditions and developing plating control strategies. Furthermore, a correlation between lithium plating and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are utilized to demonstrate the influence of previous ageing conditions on lithium plating."

However, Li-ion cells are complex multi-layer devices and as such these techniques have poor resolution, limiting applicability. In this work we develop hybrid thermo-electrochemical sensing arrays placed within the cell. The arrays are integrated into A5 pouch cells during manufacture and are used to create thermal maps in parallel with anode and cathode electrochemical data. The sensor array can be adapted to a range of cell formats and chemistries and installed into commercial or other industrially relevant cells, incorporating enhanced thermal and electrochemical diagnostic capability into a standard cell build."

This is achieved using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and a novel method of identifying and defining the threshold frequency between pseudo-capacitive and diffusion processes of the cell. It is found that this threshold frequency is independent of current intensity up to 1 C, showing that even at high power, pseudo-capacitance has significant impact. However, a severe dependency upon relative cell surface area and State of Charge (SoC) is identified. Symmetrical charge-discharge pulses of up to 10 s utilise primarily cell capacitance. Literature indicates, that this level of utilisation reduces the electrochemical ageing impact significantly. This article displays a method to identify and isolate these processes for any given cell and to allow enhancement of conventional ageing modelling."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion is increasingly the technology of choice for battery-powered systems. Current cell performance monitoring, which relies on measurements of full cell voltage and sporadic surface temperature, does not provide a reliable information on the true internal battery state. Here, we address this issue by transforming off the shelf cells into smart systems by embedding flexible distributed sensors for long-term in-situ and operando thermodynamic data collection. Our approach, which enables the monitoring of the true battery state, does not impact its performance. In particular, our results show that this unprecedented methodology can be used to optimise the performance and map the safety limits of lithium-ion cells. We find that the cell core temperature is consistently and significantly higher than the surface temperature, and reveal a breach of safety limits during a rapid discharge test. We also demonstrate an application of a current considerably higher than the manufacturers\u2019 specification, enabling a significant decrease in charging time, without compromising the cell's thermal stability. Consequently, this work on cell instrumentation methodology has the potential to facilitate significant advances in battery technology."

    "abstract": "Li-ion cell designs, component integrity, and manufacturing processes all have critical influence on the safety of Li-ion batteries. Any internal defective features that induce a short circuit, can trigger a thermal runaway: a cascade of reactions, leading to a device fire. As consumer device manufacturers push aggressively for increased battery energy, instances of field failure are increasingly reported. Notably, Samsung made a press release in 2017 following a total product recall of their Galaxy Note 7 mobile phone, confirming speculation that the events were attributable to the battery and its mode of manufacture. Recent incidences of battery swelling on the new iPhone 8 have been reported in the media, and the techniques and lessons reported herein may have future relevance. Here we look deeper into the key components of one of these cells and confirm evidence of cracking of electrode material in tightly folded areas, combined with a delamination of surface coating on the separator, which itself is an unusually thin monolayer. We report microstructural information about the electrodes, battery welding attributes, and thermal mapping of the battery whilst operational. The findings present a deeper insight into the battery\u2019s component microstructures than previously disseminated. This points to the most probable combination of events and highlights the impact of design features, whilst providing structural considerations most likely to have led to the reported incidences relating to this phone."

    "abstract": "The performance evaluation and optimisation of commercially available lithium-ion cells is typically based upon their full cell potential and surface temperature measurements, despite these parameters not being fully representative of the electrochemical processes taking place in the core of the cell or at each electrode. Several methods were devised to obtain the cell core temperature and electrode-specific potential profiles of cylindrical Li-ion cells. Optical fibres with Bragg Gratings were found to produce reliable core temperature data, while their small mechanical profile allowed for low-impact instrumentation method. A pure metallic lithium reference electrode insertion method was identified, avoiding interference with other elements of the cell while ensuring good contact, enabling in-situ observations of the per-electrode electrochemical responses. Our thermo-electrochemical instrumentation technique has enabled us to collect unprecedented cell data, and has subsequently been used in advanced studies exploring the real-world performance limits of commercial cells."

    "abstract": "The charging rates of commercial high-energy Li-ion cells are limited by the manufacturer's specifications leading to lengthy charging times. However, these cells are typically capable of much faster charging, if one ensures that the thermal and electrode-specific voltage profiles do not exceed safety limits. Unfortunately, precise and in-situ measurements of these parameters have not been achieved to date without altering the operation of these cells. Here we present a method to assess the maximum current for commercial 18650s, using novel instrumentation methods enabling in operando measurements. We found the maximum charging current that could be safely applied to the evaluated high-energy cells is 6.7 times higher than the manufacturer-stated maximum. Subsequently a rapid-charging protocol was developed that leads to over five-fold reduction in charging times without compromising the safety limits of the cells. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for a more sophisticated understanding of commercial Li-ion cells through deployment of diverse in-situ sensor systems. This understanding will enable advances in battery materials science, thermal engineering and electrical engineering of battery technology. Furthermore, this work has the potential to help the design of energy storage systems for high performance applications such as motor racing and grid balancing."

The evaluated ionic liquid treatment was effective in terms of nanocrystalline cellulose production, leaving chemical and supermolecular structure of the materials intact. However, nanocrystalline cellulose II was found to be more prone to ionic liquid hydrolysis leading to formation larger amount of small particles. Each nanocrystalline cellulose was subsequently mixed with a solution of chitosan, so that composite films containing 1, 3, and 5% mass\/mass of nanometric filler were obtained. Reference samples of chitosan and chitosan with micrometric celluloses were also solvent casted. Thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of films were tested and correlated with properties of filler used.

Due to the immiscibility of the contiguous salt and metal phases, the battery appears as three distinct layers: (1) positive electrode, (2) electrolyte and (3) negative electrode layers. The configuration of the in-situ reference electrode within the three floating liquid layers is described and is to avoid direct electrical contact\/short circuit with the other electrodes. Electrochemical tests, including linear sweep voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling, evaluate the performance of a magnesium\u2013antimony battery under a range of operating temperatures and current densities. Through the polarization studies, the area resistance of the negative and positive electrodes and the overall battery are found to be ca. 0.55, 0.65 and 1.20 \u03a9 cm\u22122, respectively. In a typical 1 h charge\/discharge per cycle experiment, average voltage efficiencies of ca. 64% are obtained at 60 mA cm\u22122 with a slight deterioration after subsequent cycles. In these tests, the half-cell measurements also indicate that the sprayed layer of boron nitride at the reference electrode is chemically stable and shown to be an effective electrical insulator for prolonged operation at high temperature (ca. 700 \u00b0C)."

Initially, UPR has been widely used with building materials, i.e., concrete to increase the mechanical properties; hence, the applications of UPR-modified concrete as a building material will also be summarized. The thriving use of UPR with concrete paved the way to use it with asphalt mixture. In recent years, the modification of asphalt using UPR for pavement construction has become popular due to the superior mechanical properties and low material cost compared to other asphalt mixtures. This chapter will illustrate the recent advancement of UPR in asphalt modification, its prospects, and the circular economy for sustainable and perpetual road pavement. Finally, the chapter will summarize the applications of UPR in asphalt pavements."

This paper uses the coupling relationship between the human and environmental risks to predict the progression in overall risk-level of construction process at Rongjiazhai station of Xi\u2019an Metro Line 5 in China. The coupling model and system dynamics simulation are applied in four steps: develop the coupling model, estimate the weight index for metro construction risk factors, calculate the risk levels, and estimate the degrees of coupling risks.

A questionnaire survey was used to record opinions of respondents hailing from diverse socio-economic backgrounds on trip number and mode preferences for a variety of trip purposes for \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cduring\u201d COVID-19 situation. This was used to assess changes in (i) trip frequencies, and (ii) travel mode preferences using contingency tables, ordinal logistic regression and Sankey diagrams. Analyses revealed that COVID-19 caused large variation in mode preferences but small variation in trip frequencies. Males still go outside for work and shopping, putting them at greater risk than females. COVID-19 has drastically cut recreational trips, but not so many work trips. Although online work or education (950%) and shopping (170%) has risen, this seems to be limited to urban areas. Besides, buses continue to be preferred the most during pandemic for trips involving short distance recreation (26.75%), markets (43.18%), and long distance recreation (35.66%). Results suggest the lack of online penetration in rural and suburban areas have prevented worktrip reductions in those places, putting the inhabitants at heightened risk from virus. Moreover, majority of the people continue to use buses at the expense of their health for lack of cheaper alternatives. Results imply that the government needs to ensure proper hygiene practices in public transit and non-motorised paratransit vehicles. Moreover, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), pedestrian and bicycle facilities need to be improved."

The coefficient of permeability of HMA samples with different contents of bitumen and LDPE was estimated to understand rainwater infiltration rate. The Marshall Mix Design Procedures ASTM D6927-15 were applied to estimate the Marshall Stability and flow values. The coefficient of permeability of HMA samples with different contents of bitumen and LDPE was estimated to understand the rainwater infiltration rate. The falling head method of permeability test estimates the water infiltration rate. The results show that the optimum bitumen content (5.5-6% by weight of aggregates) with higher contents of LDPE materials (15% by weight of bitumen) increase structural stability, reduce permanent deformation, increase ductility, and improve fatigue life of HMA mixtures. This study also finds that permeability of HMA mixtures decreases rapidly for 4% to 4.5% of bitumen contents. Impermeability for all type of HMA mixtures increases slightly with 1% to 4% air voids. Findings of this study complement to studies on plastic materials in bituminous pavements such as: (1) estimation of optimum contents of both bitumen and plastic materials in HMA mixtures and (2) estimation of permeability coefficients with different proportion of both bitumen and plastic contents to understand the impacts of plastic materials on the permeability of bituminous pavement."

    "abstract": "Rail transport of hazardous materials is a major safety concern for urban areas and an efficient emergency response plan is required in case of rail accident involving hazardous materials. Failure to response immediate aftermath of train accidents involving the release of hazardous materials can lead to catastrophic consequence. The emergency services face challenges to coordinate the activities because the response time plays a crucial role in minimising the adverse impacts. Integration of the real-time traffic information with emergency vehicles dispatch in assigning the appropriate response vehicles and guide these vehicles through the fastest routes requires to achieve the efficient performance of emergency response. This paper develops a computational resolution of a problem which can be reduced to finding the fastest path for emergency vehicle using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. ACO is an adaptative algorithm that transfers information from past environment to a new one to iteratively build a relevant solution with a heuristic-based method. This study applies A* algorithm considering the distance as crow flies to bring a faster solution. The road network within 5 km buffer zone of rail tracks at Angers city in France is considered as a case study. The case study enables to testing the algorithm in a complex urban environment where the exposure of people and properties towards hazardous materials released in freight train accident is high. The designed system computes the right number of emergency vehicles required depending on disaster characteristics and dynamically choice the best route starting from different places using real-time data. The heuristic ACO method developed in this paper solves efficiently the routing problem with providing quite suitable and diversified solutions in a reasonable computing time."

    "abstract": "Older people are vulnerable road users with higher rate of casualties in traffic accidents. The commonly cited causes of accidents for older people are poor attention and decision making at critical locations of road, poor visibility in extreme weather, poor road surface condition and unpredictability of other road users, particularly young drivers. Female drivers are often labelled as being precarious drivers and having higher accident risk comparing to male drivers. This paper applies Backpropagation - Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) with a Generalized Delta Rule (GDR) learning algorithm to model the factors affecting traffic accidents of both older female and male drivers. The BP-ANN can construct the causation model of traffic accidents with greater accuracy and define the proportion of errors contributed by each factor to traffic accidents. This paper studies a total of 95,092 accident records in West Midlands of the United Kingdom during the period of 2006 to 2016. This paper determines journey purpose, lighting condition, pedestrian crossing with physical interventions, complex roadway geometry, extreme weather and time severity as the most significant factors of older driver accidents. The accident risk of older drivers can be improved by providing accessible routes, affordable, reliable and convenient public transport, timely warning of unexpected situations and changes in roadway geometry; increasing use of assistive technology in cars, driverless cars and encouraging active transports into sociable activities. The findings help the transport authorities and city councils to develop strategies and measures promoting public and active transports to ensuring the safety of older drivers."

    "abstract": "Many cities in the United Kingdom are upgrading the streetlights to white light-emitting diode (LED) lamps for reducing the electricity costs and attaining the sustainable energy solutions. Installation of LED lamps on urban street requires higher installation costs and a long-term period to payback benefits of replacing outdated streetlights in terms of energy savings and costs. To achieve the short-term energy efficiency of urban street lighting, city councils sometimes adopt the part-night lighting system particularly in the residential areas. The Coventry City Council recently replaced 29,701 existing sodium lights with LED lamps. This paper performs the economic analyses to understand the feasibility of two street lighting systems: LED lamps and \u2018part-night\u2019 lightings on the Coventry streets during the twenty-year period assuming the return period of investment is twenty years. The projection of energy consumption and costs for LED lamps and part-night lighting systems shows that electricity can be saved by 44% and 21% comparing to current electricity usages, respectively. Considering the budgetary constraints of Coventry City Council, this paper concludes that the part-night lighting system may be beneficial in short-term period, but it is economically feasible to replace the existing lower efficiency lights with LED lamps."

Date palm oil contains anti-oxidant isomers that have the potential to enhance the performance and durability of bitumen. The compressive strength test of asphalt pavement mixed with Date palm oil was performed in accordance with British Standards BS 1881: Part 116: 1983. The cube specimens of asphalt pavement were manufactured mixing with 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% of Date palm oil out of total sample mass. The experimental results suggested that Date palm oil as a bitumen modifier reduced the compressive strength of HMA pavement. The findings of this paper urge for further experiments to understand the effects of Date palm oil on the asphalt pavements under long-term traffic load, environment and surface drainage."

The BP-ANN can predict the rut depth with greater accuracy and define the proportion of errors contributed by explanatory variables to rut depth. The BP-ANN model predicts the maximum rut depth as a function of annual average daily traffic (AADT), speed, longitudinal variance profile (LPV), skid resistance, design traffic, temperature, road texture and equivalent single axle load (ESAL) for 638 road segments in West Midlands. Data on the selected road segments were collected from the HAPMS (Highways England Pavement Management System) database. The BP-ANN model determined that LPV at 3m is the most important variable of rut depth followed by skid resistance, AADT and ESAL. This study also finds that high temperature coupled with traffic loads accelerates the rutting progression. The accurate prediction ability of rutting progression by BP-ANN model supports the systematic maintenance of bituminous pavements increasing the drivers\u2019 comfort and safety."

It analyses the resilience connotation and evaluates the system resilience using the resilience index. The Delphi method determined the resilience indices. The ANP extension cloud synthesis was constructed combining the cloud and matter-element extension theories to address the randomness and ambiguity of the resilience assessment process for subway construction sites. This study reveals that the resilience level was consistent with actual engineering project assessment at all stations. The resilience assessment of the Shuangzhai Station project ranks first followed by that of Sanyizhuang and then the Sports Centre station. The findings of this study argue for strengthening the resilience management, taking measures to optimise and improve the security system, enhancing the defence ability and anti-risk mechanism at the construction sites of the sports centre and the Sanyizhuang stations."

    "abstract": "Operating roads are critical during emergency operations at a disaster area. Prolonged inundation of pavements accelerates rapid deterioration of pavements and increases maintenance cost. The upgrade of vulnerable pavements with a raised subgrade and gabion walls is proposed as the means to increase the resiliency of strategic roads vital during the emergency attention in the aftermath of a cyclone. Hence, optimal pavement management can be used to allocate upgrade and maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) operations to reduce the damage and mitigate the geo-physical risk and community vulnerability before the disaster even occurs. A case study is presented for regional highways, arterial and collector roads of Barguna district in Bangladesh that is frequently affected by cyclones and storm surges. The geo-physical risk and vulnerability (GEOPHRIV) index of each road segments is estimated by integrating the geo-physical risk; community, structure and infrastructure vulnerabilities; and damage indices. Dynamic linear programming is applied to optimise M&R strategies and the conversion of strategic roads into resilient perpetual pavements. The same budget required to optimise roads condition is also used to guide the conversion of roads into perpetual pavements, therefore increasing the overall network resiliency. As expected, the results show that most of the annual budget is equally expended into the conversion or the resurfacing of pavements. The decision-making approach herein proposed is very useful to roads agencies around the world, because it provides them with the ability to increase the resiliency of their strategic network ex-ante any flooding disaster."

The results from laboratory tests corroborate the performance efficiency of OASIS\u2060\u00ae material to delay peak stormwater flow and mitigate flooding. The OASIS\u2060\u00ae materials not only increase the ability of permeable pavement system to absorb and retain stormwater up to a saturation limit but also retain the nutrient contaminants infiltrate to groundwater. The designed application programme will help the designers and constructors to increases the drainage efficiency of pavement structure by estimating the optimal thickness of OASIS\u2060\u00ae layer required to delay peak stormwater flow during maximum rainfall intensities."

A case study of regional highways, arterial and collector roads at the district of Barguna, in Bangladesh is selected given the frequency of cyclones and storm surges in this area. A geo-physical risk and vulnerability (GEOPHRIV) index was estimated for each road\u2019s segment by integrating the geo-physical risk; community, structure and infrastructure vulnerabilities; and damage indices. Linear programming was applied to optimize M&R strategies to ensure good pavement condition for all roads at a minimum M&R budget. Lifecycle optimization of M&R operations estimated that USD 2.49\u202fmillion is the minimum annual budget that ensures having good average road\u2019s condition in the study area. Most of the annual M&R budget will be invested for overlay and resealing treatments on the roads at high and medium GEOPHRIV areas.

A case study of highway 25 is used to illustrate the method and verify the levels of air contaminants from additionally induced traffic during and after the construction of highway. Natural traffic growth was removed from the effect of observed gas emissions by comparing observed levels on other further locations in the same metropolitan area. This study estimates air pollution from the additional traffic during and after the construction of A-25 extension project. NO2 levels were spatially interpolated during peak and off-peak hour traffic and traffic density simulated on the road network for four scenarios. Comparing the four scenarios, it was found that levels of NO2 concentrations were reduced at neighbor areas due to less traffic during the construction period. Levels of NO2 after the construction were higher than those in 2008. The simulated traffic density for four scenarios revealed that traffic density was significantly increased on both arterial and access roads within the close vicinity of the extension project during and after its construction.Publisher Statement: This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."

This article analyses the behaviour of young bicyclists taking voluntary risks. The university students in Montreal are considered as the case study since they are more risk takers and the bicycle is a favorite mode of transport among them. This study reveals that half of the respondents did not use helmets. They were also spontaneously taking a risk by high speeding, violating signals, bicycling in mixed traffic, ignoring protective equipment after dark, and avoiding the bicycle designated roads. They were taking voluntary risks based on their attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. They did not perceive the severity of risks since they experienced prevalent and unremarkable minor injuries. The attractiveness of risk and accomplishing the risk activities encouraged the young bicyclists to take voluntary risks repeatedly. Increasing feelings of vulnerability among young bicyclists reduce voluntary risks taking attitude and physical and psychological sufferings of the victims of bicycle-related accidents. Findings of this study suggest that the City of Montreal as well as other cities consider the behaviour of bicyclists particularly the young people to avoid bicycle-related accidents along with other physical measures."

The Multi-Layer Perceptron network and sigmoid activation function are applied to build the BPN network of Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Collector and arterial roads of both flexible and rigid pavements in Montreal City are taken as a case study. The input variables of the PCI are Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), Equivalent Single Axle Loads (ESALs), Structural Number (SN), pavement age, slab thickness and difference in the PCI between the current and preceding year (\u0394PCI). The BPN networks estimate that the PCI has inverse relationships with AADT, ESALs and pavement age. The PCI has positive relationships with these variables for roads that have recent treatment operations. The PCI has positive relationships with SN and slab thickness that imply the increase in pavement condition with increasing structural strength and slab thickness. The \u0394PCI significantly influences the estimation of PCI values. The AADT and ESALs have considerable importance; however, pavement age and structural characteristics of the pavement have an insignificant influence in determining the PCI values, except in the case of flexible arterial roads."

It was found that the two additional centers were mainly composed of residential uses, influenced by the proximity to a mega city (Dhaka), the export processing zone, and Jahangirnagar University. Spatial auto-regression analysis revealed a series of factors showing significant weight on land prices of Savar: area and topographical elevations, population density, distance from bus terminal, road infrastructure, central business district, schools, hospitals, markets, and hazardous industries.

    "abstract": "The turning decision of a vehicle, at a signalized intersection, depends on the characteristics of the road users (e.g., vehicle, pedestrians, bicycles) and the intersection. The objective of this chapter is to estimate the turning decision of left-turning vehicles at a signalized intersection in a university campus. The signalized intersection, at the crossing of Boulevard de Maisonneuve Ouest and Rue MacKay within the Sir George Williams campus of the Concordia University (Montreal, Canada), is considered as a case study. The traffic video data were collected from 10a.m. to 5p.m. during the period of July\u2014October in the year 2010. Vehicles turn at the intersection based on the gap between those and the crossing traffic, and complete the turning maneuver accepting the adequate gap (time or distance). The mean value of accepting the gap is known as the critical gap acceptance (CGA). The stochastic modeling of the left-turning decision is implemented at two stages\u2014the estimation of the CGA by using probabilistic approaches; and the determination of the factors\u2014 contribution by applying backpropagation neural network (BPN). The stochastic distribution functions estimate the CGA for passenger cars and other vehicles (e.g., buses, trucks, and vans) as 14.3s and 16.5s, respectively. The BPN models determine the bicycle distance from conflict point, platoon bicycles, existence of bicycle at conflict zone, bicycles\u2014 speed, vehicles\u2014 speed, pedestrians\u2014 speed, number of vehicles passed, and vehicle moving at conflict zone are the predominant factors of left-turning decision."

    "abstract": "Traditional pavement management system uses historical data on traffic volume or traffic growth rate to develop the pavement deterioration curves. This study simulates the traffic loads on regional and urban road networks to estimate the pavement deterioration curves applying travel demand models at urban and regional scales during the period of 2013\u20132062. Highways 1, 2, 7, 15, 16, 102, and 104 connecting the Atlantic Provinces of Canada are considered as the case study at regional scale. Arterial and local roads of both rigid and flexible pavement types in the city of Montreal are considered as the case study at urban scale. The TRANUS model integrates spatial input-output and transportation models to simulate interprovincial freight movement on the regional road network. Urban transportation planning system simulates the urban traffic on the road network of the city of Montreal. The accumulated traffic loads are calculated based on the predicted annual average daily traffic and locally observed truck distributions combined with truck factors. Roughness progression on regional highways and urban roads is estimated by applying regression model of international roughness index (IRI). The IRI will be 35.71, 43.33, 31.62, and 30.67 for flexible-arterial, rigid-arterial, flexible-local and rigid-local roads during the period of 2013\u20132062, respectively. Comparative evaluation of with and without simulated traffic reveals that the impact of simulated traffic is highest on the pavement structure of Highways 2 and 1 at regional level and rigid-arterial and flexible roads of Montreal. This study improves the traditional method of estimating pavement deterioration by incorporating the simulated traffic and traffic loads into the pavement performance function."

This service-based approach needs to be balanced with the budget constraints, level of service and risk tolerance. The transportation agencies have not yet addressed the integrated land use and transportation modelling, the comparison of the relative advantages between capital and operating investments, the risk-based estimation, and the identification of a range of costs associated with the failure within the RIAMS. The transportation agencies should develop a performance-based RIAMS ensuring the serviceability, accountability, stewardship, long-term financial plans, and transparent investments. The RIAMS is still emerging and needs to incorporate the local mission, budget and other constraints within the scope of the local context."

    "abstract": "The pavement performance modeling is an essential part of pavement management system (PMS). It estimates the long-range investment requirement and the consequences of budget allocation for maintenance treatments of a particular road segment on the future pavement condition. The performance models are also applied for life-cycle economic evaluation and for the prioritization of pavement maintenance treatments. This chapter discusses various deterministic and stochastic approaches for calculating the pavement performance curves. The deterministic models include primary response, structural performance, functional performance, and damage models. The deterministic models may predict inappropriate pavement deterioration curves because of uncertain pavement behavior under fluctuating traffic loads and measurement errors. The stochastic performance models assume the steady-state probabilities and cannot consider the condition and budget constraints simultaneously for the PMS. This study discusses the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BPN) method with generalized delta rule (GDR) learning algorithm to offset the statistical error of the pavement performance modeling. This study also argues for the application of reliability analyses dealing with the randomness of pavement condition and traffic data."

    "abstract": "Deterioration of rural roads due to the absence of an effective pavement management system has become a growing concern in Bangladesh. Since the allocation of government funds for maintenance operations is very negligible and foreign assistance for this purpose is very limited, unplanned and unsystematic maintenance operations cause serious deterioration of the rural road infrastructure. However, a well-planned maintenance operation must consider not only accumulated traffic loads and environmental exposure, but the social and economic benefits as well. The objective of this paper is to optimize maintenance operations of rural roads based on pavement condition and social benefits for the surrounding zones. A case study of the rural road network of the Gazipur district of Bangladesh is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The pavement performance modeling of the rural road network of the Gazipur district is based on the mechanistic modeling of roughness progression using the International Roughness Index (IRl). Social benefits of each road link were defined as a Rural Priority Indicator (RPI), which was calculated based on the hierarchy and centrality of rural functions and villages. This study identifies CAD 3 million as the minimum annual maintenance budget by which the Pavement Condition Index (PCI of the whole road network can be increased to 83%. The maximization of the total network condition and social benefits under this budget was applied to find the optimal strategic results for pavement management. This study provides a guideline for rural road maintenance operations in Bangladesh, which will enable the government to perform the maintenance operations systematically and in a well-planned way within budget constraints."

    "abstract": "Not very long ago Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, possessed an image of a city of greenery and water bodies. But at present, it is a usual fact that the communities of Dhaka City are deprived of open spaces. Although Dhaka City is expanding into new areas, it has been suffering from inadequate provision of open spaces and the growth in housing sector has not been followed by proportional growth in urban facilities, and consequently, the ratio of open spaces to constructed area is far below the planning standards. There is no uniformity in planning standard and spatial distribution of open spaces within Dhaka City. The planning standards only specify the area required and seldom specify where the open spaces should be located. A Location-allocation Model (Alternating Heuristic Algorithm) can be applied to determine optimal allocation of open spaces. In this paper, the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Location-allocation Model is used for optimal allocation of open spaces at Uttara model town considering all aspects of spatial planning such as accessibility maximization (minimum travel distance), capacity constraints of the open space, land suitability for the open spaces, and dynamic nature of the location of open spaces (assuming the stationary nature of demand points). Uttara model town is preferred as a case study as it is a newly developed town believed to comprise of all planning standards and it has better opportunity to implement optimal allocation of open spaces. This study concludes that 500-meter buffer zone of the existing location of open spaces is 3,893,543 sq. m. which will increased by 2.11% after deriving the 500-meter buffer zone of optimally allocated open spaces based on the standard requirements. The optimal solution space, generated by the integration of GIS and location-allocation model, can be further used for spatial planning of other public facilities such as schools, hospitals, clinics, markets and fire stations."

    "abstract": "This study was aimed at examining the motivations, elements and channels of sustainability reporting of a multinational mining company that operates a subsidiary in Ghana. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among the company's key stakeholders. These informants were drawn from the case company, a public regulatory agency, members and the opinion leaders of the company's host community. In addition to the primary data, secondary documents were relied upon to corroborate the views shared by the interviewees. We discovered that while the sustainability reporting mechanism was necessary for gaining internal legitimacy with the parent company, to a large extent, the host community did not appreciate the importance of that report. In place of that the management of the mining subsidiary employed less-formal channels of communication to engage the community representatives on matters relating to sustainability. Our findings suggest that the sustainability reporting process must be adaptable and not always communicated formally. Therefore, the process needs to be re-organised to meet the expectations of all key stakeholders within the subsidiary companies' jurisdictions. To meet the expectation of stakeholders and gain legitimacy, those charged with the governance of subsidiary companies need to contextualise their sustainability reporting strategies."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Using a subsidiary of a multinational mining company in Ghana as a case, the purpose of this study is to examine the formal and informal forms and channels of sustainability reporting in the emerging economy\u2019s context. Design\/methodology\/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted amongst managers and employees of the mining company and members of their host community. Based on the interview themes, archival data were extracted from the 2020 Integrated Annual Report of the case company to corroborate the results from the interviews. Findings: The authors found that most of the stakeholders from the host community interviewed were not aware and, to an extent, not interested in formal sustainability reports. In place of that, the management of the mining subsidiary uses informal channels of communication, including meetings and durbars, to verbally engage the local community and their representatives on sustainability matters. Whilst the formal sustainability reports met the internal requirements set by the parent company, the informal engagements were critical for gaining external legitimacy from the host community and other interest groups. Hence, the authors argue that mining companies and their subsidiaries, particularly in developing economies, need to consider informal forms of sustainability reporting alongside the formal channels to engage local communities to address sustainability issues and avert disruptions to their operations. Originality\/value: Sustainability reporting studies have focussed mainly on annual reports published in print or corporate websites, ignoring informal forms of sustainability reporting. This study sheds light on the informal forms of sustainability reporting. This is important as formal forms of sustainability reporting may be less useful for engaging local mining communities in developing economy contexts."

Using case studies of exporting Nigerian small and medium sized enterprises, the authors document how exporting arrangements are enforced across West African markets. Interview data reveal how entrepreneurs take advantage of indigenous trust-based relationships to enforce exporting agreements. It is clear that exporting activities are shaped by trust and networks of kinship, and market associations that permeate West African region. This chapter facilitates a better understanding of trust and the range of indigenous relationships that underpin exporting activities in Nigeria and particularly across West Africa,"

    "abstract": "Applying the institution-based views, this article conceptualises how diaspora entrepreneurs take stimuli from the push and pull institutional factors to develop business enterprises in their countries of origin. Using cases of African diaspora entrepreneurs in the UK and the grounded theory methodological approach, our conceptualised model demonstrates that the diasporas use the new knowledge, skills and wealth they have gained in the UK in tandem with support from trusted family, kinship and business ties at home to develop enterprises. It further demonstrates that diaspora entrepreneurs foster resilience to withstand weak formal institutions in theircountries of origin and the discriminatory obstacles in the UK. We also found that institutional barriers which served as push factors that encouraged or forced migrants to leave their home countries to seek greener pastures abroad may later become pull factors that enable them to engage in diaspora entrepreneurship which is oftencharacterised by paradoxes. Particularly, the informal institutions that constrain foreign investors can become assets for African diaspora entrepreneurs and help them set up new businesses and exploit market opportunities in Africa. The implications of the study for diaspora entrepreneurship literature are outlined."

Constructed in the assumptions of multidimensionality and the inherent tensions of relationships, the design of this study is interpretive, following an emergent iterative process, where three distinct types of trust, cognitive-based trust, affect-based trust and calculus-based trust were considered as critical components for successful SME relationships. Conversely, the unpredictable negative behavior of a trade partner was critical to the development of calculus-based distrust and identification-based distrust. The results facilitate a better understanding of the distinct types of trust and distrust that underpin SME relationships in Nigeria and other developing economies, particularly in Africa. This article contributes to the ongoing debate over the two contrary yet complementary opposites of trust and distrust, and their ability to provide explanations to economic activity."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine with particular interest the mechanism of trust in Nigeria\u2019s unique socio-economic landscape. This becomes pertinent as formalised institutional arrangements such as courts and legal structures appear to be underdeveloped. We theorise by drawing on the concept of institutional rivalry as it presupposes an understanding of alternative institutional forms operating in parallel to deficient formal institutions. Guided by the investigation of 36 exporting Nigerian SMEs, we reveal how entrepreneurs were found to rely on cultural specific relationships to address the limitations of weak and deficient state backed institutions. At its center, we describe how entrepreneurs relied on indigenous institutions such as ties to family and kinship, chieftaincy, religion and trade associations in resolving disputes during exporting. The findings reached in this study provide well founded and valid insights into the role of trust within Nigeria and other parts of Africa."

It draws on institutional theory and firm characteristics to compare and contrast the sustainability reporting contents on the websites of two plants of a multinational mining company in the same country. The study uses case study approach with qualitative content analysis to benchmark the sustainability information found on the websites of the two plants of Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd at Ahafo and Newmont Golden Ridge Ltd at Akyem based on the Global Reporting Initiative and the United Nations Division for Sustainability Development models. It was discovered that even though both plants reported on all aspects of sustainability - economic, environmental and social, the plant sites vary in the contents and details of reports even though the websites had the same headings. These variations are arguably due to the institutional pressures and variations in the characteristics of the two plants. This article contributes to an understanding of how on site-specific institutional pressures from stakeholders such as community and regulatory bodies and the size and age of subsidiaries may impact on sustainability reporting."

In this chapter, they adopt the perspective of institutional logics as a particular reference point due to its influence in shaping entrepreneurial action. The choice of adopting a contextual approach also aims to highlight differences to Western models where institutional frameworks are perceived to be more benign. The case study of Pakistani women entrepreneurs therefore presents an interesting evidence for examining the complexities of women entrepreneurship. Within the remit of this chapter, the goal is to elucidate the uniqueness of Pakistani women entrepreneurs as influenced by its institutional context. It is expected that the findings from this study will contribute to new knowledge and have practical and policy implications for enhancing women entrepreneurship."

Specifically, this paper attempts to address this gap by examining how trust is developed and repairedin supply chain relationships.Design\/methodology\/approach- Within the scope of this paper, an interpretivist approach was adopted in response to calls for qualitative studies on supply chain relationships. Face to face semi-structured interviews with 12 supplier\/customers active in Nigerian trade provided insights into the importance of trust and distrust in enduring supply chain relationships. Data was analysed using iterations from interviews held with the respondents. These iterations demonstrate the key role trust plays in developing and maintainingsupply chain relationships whereas distrust deters cooperative relationships.Findings- Key factors were considered in developing an understanding of howtrust and distrust mechanisms affect the coordination of supply chain performance. Three distinct types of trust-calculus based trust (CBT), identification based trust (IBT) and knowledge based trust (KBT) are consideredto play an important role in maintaining and developing fruitful relationships.Conversely, the repair of two levels of distrust-calculus based distrust and identification based distrust is crucial to enduring supply chain relationships.Research limitations\/implications- The importance of taking trust and distrustseriously stems from its unique contextual embeddedness. This study fills a gapin the literature by providing insights into how potential customers and supplierscan leverage on trust to improve their supply chain capacities while suggestingremedial actions when trust is violated.Originality- The paper enriches the view that trust and distrust are crucial in explaining Nigerian supply chain relationships. In a broader context, the complementary relationships between both mechanisms highlight the socialadvantage of trusting behaviour in overall performance of supply chains."

    "abstract": "This study assesses how corruption impacts on the management of educational infrastructural projects in Ghana. Corruption is a constant concern for countries facing economic problems. Increasingly, researchers have devoted research to the discussion of the phenomenon; however, these discussions have focused mainly on the relationship between corruption and variables such as; economic development, social effects, innovation, firm management quality, gross domestic product (GDP), returns on investment, increase in government budget, political discontent, instability and violence, rule-violating intentions, democracy, and inequality.Despite the extensive research devoted to the subject, there is limited research on the potential impact of corruption on the management of educational infrastructural projects in developing countries. We, therefore, contribute to both academia and practice by assessing the potential impact of corruption on these projects using multiple project management success\/failure criteria as the assessment tool. Using an in-depth semi-structured interview, we solicit the views of thirty (30) project management practitioners in Ghana on the subject. The findings indicate that corruption impact negatively on the management of Ghanaian educational infrastructural projects on all the performance criteria used as the evaluating tool. The findings indicate that corruption influence government projects failure on all the failure criteria used as the evaluating tool. However, most of the corrupt practices that impact negatively on these projects are traced to partisanship politics, political culture, national culture and institutional system in the country."

Recent initiatives in United Kingdom universities respond to the calls from The Association of Business Schools to incorporate more practice into the teaching,learning and assessment of entrepreneurship curricular. The calls aim to encourage the development of entrepreneurial skills and mind sets relevant for graduate employability. One of the most appropriate approaches for designing such practice-based curricular is Problem-based learning (PBL).The authors reviewed the literature on entrepreneurship education and also drew on constructivist theories of teaching and learning based on two case studies to demonstrate how entrepreneurship curricular development could enhance graduate employability. Case story approach was used to accurately report the full extent of the knowledge of entrepreneurship educators. The findings showeda critique and rethinking of current university education in the United Kingdom. Instead of the traditional teaching and learning methods, entrepreneurship educators use a portfolio of practice based pedagogies including starting businesses, design thinking and reflective practice to embed practice into learning and assessment. The findings therefore show how the choice of teaching,learning and assessment focus on enhancing the development of entrepreneurial mind-sets and employability skills in learners. The article analysed practices and techniques for embedding entrepreneurial skills, mind-sets and employability in entrepreneurship education. It therefore highlights the processes through which practice-based curricular design enhance entrepreneurial and employability skills among university graduates."

    "abstract": "The role of technology innovation as the driving force in today\u2019s learning environment cannot be underemphasized. It is now changing the way in which learning and teaching occur in higher education. Over the years, preparing students for the world of work from higher education has been a difficult task. With the majority of students venturing into the world of work without work experience to help them understand and develop the skills to succeed in business is perturbing. Hence, for academic institutions charged with the responsibility to equip and develop students in the knowledge economy, technological innovations hold thekey to several possibilities such as distance learning and sophisticated learning management tools and systems. Amongst the sophisticated learning management systems and tools is the use of business simulationwhich assists students to grasp, understand and apply theories in the real business world. Furthermore, these tools help them to develop the soft skills that are difficult to nurture during lectures. This paper, therefore, examines the role of technology in shaping the development of business and practical skills of the student\u2019stransition from the university into the world of work. This study adopted a mixed method approach. Primary data were collected from MBA and MSc students who participated in the use of the business simulation tool on their perception over ten semesters. This was aimed at explaining the development of business skills using the business simulation technology. The preliminary results show a positive relationship between business simulation game participation and improvement of both hard and soft business skills of students such as; highquality learning, development of critical thinking, decision making, teamwork and analytical skill"

The aim of this paper is to investigate the characteristics, challenges and opportunities in the music industry in three sub-Saharan African countries.Prior Work:It is estimated that the creative industry that was growing annually at 5% in the early 2000s is expected to triple in growth globally by 2020. In both developed and developing countries, music remains one of the most significant of the creative industries. Music in the contemporary world generates billions of pounds in revenues for composers, performers, publishers, record companies and many others. Nonetheless, there has been a lack of empirical studies on activities of entrepreneurs in the music industry in developing countries. This paper therefore aims at filling this gap by investigating the characteristics, challenges and opportunities in the music industry in the three sub-Saharan African countries.Approach:A collection of data from a survey of music entrepreneurs in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania with the aim of understanding the challenges, characteristics and opportunities available to creative entrepreneurs in the music industry in the sub-Saharan African continent.Results:The survey showed that the majority of musicians in the three countries are younger, on aggregate have higher levels of education and the overwhelming majority of firms in the industry were micro or small, young, sole proprietorships and operate in the informal sector.  However, we also found that the entrepreneurs were faced with a number of challenges notably copyright issues, inflation, lack of access to formal sources of capital and funding, lower customer demand, inability to digitise music, competition, corruption, and lack of marketing and marketing support. Notwithstanding these challenges, the potential for growth and profitability in the industry were acknowledged by the entrepreneurs and this was confirmed by respondents\u2019 willingness to invest in their businesses.Implications:Researchers may draw on this exploratory research to understand the nature of the music industry in other sub-Saharan African countries. Public policy and the donor community can draw on the identified challenges and address them to promote entrepreneurship in the industry. Entrepreneurs should be aware of the challenges in the industry and adopt a marketing orientation while exploiting the opportunities available through social media to promote their images and businesses.Value:This study  fills a major gap in the literature by providing  insights into entrepreneurial activities in the sub-Saharan African music industry. In particular, we provide an empirical comparative study on this important industry in sub-Saharan Africa."

Institutional forms operating in parallel to the formal legal system are examined. These are shown to be hybrid forms drawing on traditional cultural institutions such as chieftaincy and religion, combined with forms of corporations and cooperatives. Assumptions around the different roles of family and kinship also are explored.

    "abstract": "In this era of globalisation, firms and their managers are increasingly interested in building relationships with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in order to successfully grow and compete. Trust has been found to be a defining factor in building up networks and relationships which firms use in economic exchanges both at national and international levels. However, the role of trust in the context of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) internationalisation is a recent phenomenon of academic inquiry that has not been widely studied particularly in the context of developing countries. Hence, this study aimsto fill this knowledge gap by investigating the processes of development, use, violation and repair of trust in exporting SME relationships in a less developed African country, Ghana.At the theoretical level the study draws mostly on three perspectives: embeddedness, entrepreneurship and psychic distance. At the empirical level, this research uses a casestudy of 24 exporting SMEs in Ghana to study this subject in detail. The findings show that entrepreneurs had built and used personalised relationships while avoiding formalcontracts and the courts in their internationalisation activities. They had mostly relied on institutional forms operating in parallel to formal state-based and legal systems. These are shown to be hybrid forms drawing on traditional cultural institutions such as chieftaincy and religion, combined with forms of corporations and cooperatives. The findings further reveal how organisations violate and repair trust when crossing cultural boundaries, looking at the particular issues that face smaller businesses. Particularly, it shows that culture is an important factor in trust based relations and therefore the concept of trust violation is socially constructed. While some aspects of networks and trust literature are confirmed, other aspects are refuted showing that context impacts on the processes of relationships and trust building, violation and repair.This study therefore contributes to the ongoing development of a theoretical understanding on networking, relationship building and trust in international entrepreneurship. Particularly it emphasises the importance of understanding cultural contexts in entrepreneurship research."

After the data analysis, it was found that the Chinese universities dining-rooms waste approximately 112,555,470RMB, 9,413,288m2 and 1,317.65 units of football pitch of soil in one year just from cooked rice from suppers; there would be 39,744.45 Chinese hungry people who can be saved from starvation for one year using those cooked rice. It can be seen that the food wastage phenomenon in Chinese universities is serious."

    "abstract": "Concern over student progression and retention is driving the systematic analysis of the vast amount of student data recorded in institutional data sets and in learning management systems (LMS) data sets. This is motivated by the belief that student analytics will help uncover patterns of behaviour and predict student performance, and thus facilitate the deployment of supportive educational interventions. This paper is concerned with the investigation of the institutional data of a Nigerian university, and the predictive impact of its attributes on student performance, measured in terms of cumulative grade point average (CGPA). The statistical analysis of the data set reveals that age and marital status have no significant relationship with final CGPA, whereas gender and pre-entry score have a weak relationship but are not good predictors. The application of four representative machine learning methods, namely linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree and random forests indicate that the third year CGPA is a good predictor of final year CGPA. A higher accuracy is achieved by using the aggregate value of the CGPAs of three previous years. Support vector regression has the best performance in predicting the final CGPA, whereas decision tree is the least performing model."

An adaptive approach, which involves the construction of personalised learning paths based on learning style, was implemented in an adaptive e-learning system. A controlled experiment in this learning environment was conducted with sixty undergraduate students to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the system.

Several e-learning systems have been developed to address this issue. However, they usually provide the same material in the same sequence irrespective of the characteristics of the students, such as their knowledge level and learning style. In this paper, an approach to learning style adaptivity is proposed for the teaching of computer security. An e-learning system was developed to provide more personalised and adaptive learning, based on the information perception style of the Felder-Silverman model. This is the dimension of learning style, which has received the least attention in published research. In the approach, a personalised sequence of learning material is generated based on an individual learning style. The approach is evaluated in order to determine its effectiveness in learning provision. An experiment conducted with sixty subjects produced significant results. They indicate that matching computer security learning material, according to the learning style of the students, yields significantly better learning gain and student satisfaction than without matching"

A systematic approach is proposed in the development of a secure and trusted system to support authentication, non-repudiation and trust in business transactions.  This involves two stages. Firstly, the identification of the functional components designed to facilitate security through authentication and nonrepudiation, and those aimed at insuring trust; secondly, their implementation and integration into a hybrid P2P architecture, where the entry point server plays a central role. This integration is facilitated by the layering of functional components. Secure and trusted file transactions are further enhanced by a community management layer."

Details of the algorithm for scheduling and assignment of jobs to resources in the ring structure is presented and its performance is compared with both CNP-based distributed model, and the centralized conventional scheduling of a real manufacturing case study involving a major turbine production plant. Comparison of performance indicators such as time and cost of operations shows that the distributed models clearly outperform the conventional practice with meaningful impact on the production economy. As a possible implementation strategy, a hybrid switching model, composed of both competing models, is proposed."

Unfortunately, native HDFS does not perform well for large numbers but small size files, which has attracted significant attention. This paper firstly analyzes and points out the reasons of small file problem of HDFS: (1) large numbers of small files impose heavy burden on NameNode of HDFS; (2) correlations between small files are not considered for data placement; and (3) no optimization mechanism, such as prefetching, is provided to improve I\/O performance. Secondly, in the context of HDFS, the clear cut-off point between large and small files is determined through experimentation, which helps determine \u2018how small is small\u2019. Thirdly, according to file correlation features, files are classified into three types: structurally-related files, logically-related files, and independent files. Finally, based on the above three steps, an optimized approach is designed to improve the storage and access efficiencies of small files on HDFS. File merging and prefetching scheme is applied for structurally-related small files, while file grouping and prefetching scheme is used for managing logically-related small files. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes effectively improve the storage and access efficiencies of small files, compared with native HDFS and a Hadoop file archiving facility."

First, it requires a clear distinction between two forms of robustness: robustness at protocol level and robustness at system level. Second, selected technologies should be integrated into an appropriate architecture in order to address robustness simultaneously at the two levels. The proposed approach is illustrated by the design and implementation of an e-voting system based on the FOO92 protocol. A service-oriented architecture supported by onion routing forms the basis of the system. It facilitates the distribution of tasks and state, the dynamic path configuration and the just-in-time (JIT) composition of the election system. The system conforms to most e-voting requirements."

A proactive approach is characterized by a shift of emphasis from reacting to load imbalance to avoiding its occurrence. In contrast, in a reactive load sharing scheme, activity is triggered when a processing node is either overloaded or underloaded. The main drawback of this approach is that a load imbalance is allowed to develop before costly corrective action is taken. Concert is a load sharing scheme for loosely-coupled distributed systems. Under this scheme, load and task behaviour information is collected and cached in advance of when it is needed. Concert uses Linux as a platform for development. Implemented partially in kernel space and partially in user space, it achieves transparency to users and applications whilst keeping the extent of kernel modifications to a minimum. Non-preemptive task transfers are used exclusively, motivated by lower complexity, lower overheads and faster transfers. The goal is to minimize the average response-time of tasks. Concert is compared with other schemes by considering the level of transparency it provides with respect to users, tasks and the underlying operating system."

The novelty of this model is that it automatically customises transactions to the requirements of design activities. In addition, this model is believed to improve concurrency, fault tolerance, facilitate interaction between and co-operation among the participating systems involved in design activities. The proposed model is formally specified using CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems) language. Formalisation is crucial in ensuring the correctness, reliability, and recovery of multi-agents transactions, given the complex and unreliable nature of the distributed design activities."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on various FEA simulations conducted to study the behaviour of six impeller materials in order to predict their failures. It is through analysing the various stresses, strains and safety factor during its operation. Two static structural simulations were performed to (i) benchmark common impeller materials namely FV520B, 316 L and 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steels, and (ii) to investigate three proposed alternative materials namely duplex stainless-steel, nickel aluminium bronze (NAB) and cast iron. After this, explicit dynamic simulation was undertaken to study the same benchmarked impeller materials. Failures and large stress concentrations occurring at the blade-hub leading and trailing edge interface were predicted which has been found to be consistent with some cases outlined in relevant literature. Similarly, trend has also been predicted at the trailing edge of the discharge side of the impeller. Specifically, FV520B was found to withstand the application of the combined rotational and aerodynamic load, for both static and dynamic simulations. Of the three alternative materials investigated, duplex stainless-steel was the only one to satisfy the failure criteria. From static and dynamic simulation of each material, the operation aerodynamic load was found to have little effect on the resultant stress and strain responses. This is consistent with many FEA simulations of impellers seen in literature, wherein the aerodynamic load is often simplified or neglected completely. In both the simulations of benchmark materials, the material data available to the solver greatly impacted the magnitude and behaviour of the material's stress\/strain response."

    "abstract": "This research investigates the effects of building parameters for 3D printing Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) and their effect on topologically optimised complex models. The work is conducted by initially developing a DOE varying two parameters in 3D printing namely (i) infill ratio and (ii) infill pattern. Then based on standards ASTM D638 and ISO178, for tensile and flexural tests, specimens are 3D printed and tested for the material Nylon with CFRP (Onyx). From the results it can be observed that (i) specimen with an infill ratio of 85% (constant triangular infill pattern) was found to have the best performance recording a length extension of approximately 5.6 mm under a tensile load of 700 N (ii) in case of infill pattern, triangular shape (constant infill ratio of 37%) recorded the highest the length extension of 7.3 mm under tensile load of 650 N. (iii) 85% infill ratio (constant triangular infill pattern) recorded a bending deflection of approximately 6 mm under a compressive load of 250 N and (iv) the gyroid infill pattern (constant infill ratio of 37%) provided the highest flexural strength with an approximate extension of 5.6 mm under a compressive load of 350 N. After the experimental study and analysing the best parameters, a static analysis and topology optimisation for the 3D printed material (Nylon with CFRP(Onyx)) has been performed on an industrial part for its design validation. Based on the analysis, the original part is redesigned, and again a static analysis simulation is performed to determine the effects of the optimisation process for the same material comparing with 316L-Stainless Steel (SS). Finally, the redesigned model is manufactured with the best 3D printing parameters and validated against the original operating conditions. This study will help industries to use these 3D printing parameters where a metal-based components needs to be replaced with CFRP."

The machining orientations considered for 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 axis are (i) tilt angles of 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0 & 20\u00b0 and (ii) lead angles of 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0 & 15\u00b0 with a constant fixed tilt angle of 10\u00b0. The cutting speed and feed rate per tooth is taken as 450 m\/min and 0.5 mm\/tooth. These are based on a high speed machining (HSM) scenario and has been dynamically simulated for a maximum of 175,000 cycles. From the simulation study considered at 16-20 valid cutting points, it can be noticed that in 3 + 1 axis, for a tilt angle of 10\u00b0 and 3 + 2 axis for a Tilt 10\u00b0\/Lead 10\u00b0 the \u03c3max-principaland \u03f5max-max-principal-elasticare higher when compared with all tilt\/lead angles.

It considers the transfer of design and manufacturing systems data through the Cloud\/Web-based (CW) services and discusses an effective way to integrate them. In the 1st stage, a Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology containing Computer Aided Design (CAD) data\/models of the product with the ability to design \/ redesign is scanned and sent to a secure Internet\/Cloud Server (CS). Here the CAD models are auto identified and displayed in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed for the purpose.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a toolpath generation method to efficiently machine free form irregular contoured walls\/surfaces (FIWS) containing internal deflecting connections (IDC's). The toolpath generation method is based on a series of identifications and calculations, where initially a 'Main Computable Zone (MCZ)' in the Machinable Areas (Ma's) of FIWS is identified based on the Tool track dimensions (Td). Then the MCZ's are divided into Split Computable Zones (SCZ's) and Split Computable Zones for Internal Connections (SCZI's) which are subsequently sub divided as 'Categorized Computable Zones' (CCZ) with simple-medium-high complexity. The identification of CCZ's is based on the 10 different types of FIWS representations developed for this study. From the CCZ's categorization of complexity, they are further split into smaller 'Machinable Zones (MZ's)' using a 4-step algorithm. In the algorithm, the first step calculates a common plane (CP) to cut the steep areas in the CCZ's where the tool cannot have full access for machining. Once the CP is identified, the second step is to extend it by moving them along the CCZ's and calculate the necessary 'Machinable Zones (MZ's)' in the next stage. This is done by finding the intersection of CP with the FIWS through a point to point\/line plane intersection concept. After this step, the MZ's are re-iterated by including the open and closed surface criteria and is analyzed for the IDC's to be combined in the fourth stage. This is achieved by adding up the IDC's with the existing MZ's computed by the algorithm. At every stage, the algorithm considers tool collision avoidance and tool rubbing in the CCZ's and MZ's. This is by an automatic computation based on the height to fixture clearance for safer neck length which avoids collision and rubbings in the final toolpaths. Finally, a combined tool path is generated for all the MZ's and has been verified\/tested for a sample part and impeller containing similar shapes using UG NX\/STEP-NC software"

Initially, the theoretical tool forces are calculated by considering the cutting edge on a cutting tool as the curve of an intersection over a spherical\/flat surface based on the model developed by Lee & Altinas [1]. Considering the lowest tool forces the cutting tool parameters are taken and optimal design of end mill is decided for different sizes. Then the 3D CAD models of the end mills are developed and used for Finite Element Method to verify the cutting forces for milling Ti-6Al-4V. The cutting tool forces, stress, strain concentration (s), tool wear, and temperature of the cutting tool with the different geometric shapes are simulated considering Ti-6Al-4V as work piece material. Finally, the simulated and theoretical values are compared and the optimal design of cutting tool for different sizes are validated. The present approach considers to improve the quality of machining surface and tool life with effects of the various parameters concerning the oblique cutting process namely axial, radial and tangential forces.

The MVI provides an intermediate link between rough and finish machining computer-aided process planning system for automatic generation of process plans while machining prismatic parts. To calculate the machinable volumes of manufacturing features, the MVI utilizes the output of the feature identifier which contains the information about the dimensional details, edge loops, edges, vertices, coordinate points, and location planes of the features. In this research, a total of 234 features have been considered; out of which, 32 are normal and 202 are tapered. To calculate the machinable volumes for these features, generalized methodologies are developed for 17 basic feature types, each having a varying number of specific features. Initially, the pattern strings are generated for the front and back face of the rough-machined feature and final feature. Then, MVI uses the predefined syntactic pattern strings stored in the strings database and checks with the generated strings of the feature to determine the shape of the machinable volume stored in the volumes database. After determining the shape, one relevant methodology or more (for features having combination of more than one taper) are selected from among the 17 \"feature type\" specific methodologies developed for finish-cut machinable volume identification. In this article, methodology is presented for one basic feature type which covers 14 features and explained through one case study. The final output from this module is stored as a text file with full dimensional details of machinable volumes for later use inside the machining planning module. The proposed MVI can be used in Computer Integrated Manufacturing Industries as an intermediate linker to achieve a robust manufacturing environment."

Using these strings, initially, the types of faces on the prismatic part are determined and edge loops are constructed. The edge loops describe a feature by the information implicit in the details of the edges, vertices, coordinate points, and directions. Using the edge loops and by checking the presence of similar edge loops on parallel faces and the connectivity of faces between parallel edge loops, the final shape of a feature is identified. The developed methodology identifies interacting, tapering, interacting-tapering, curved base features, and tapering cross-sections.

    "abstract": "Agroecology is an alternative paradigm for agriculture and food systems that is simultaneously: (a) the application of ecological principles to food and farming systems that emerge from specific socioecological and cultural contexts in place-based territories; and (b) a social and political process that centers the knowledge and agency of Indigenous peoples and peasants in determining agri-food system policy and practice.Historically, agroecology is associated with a multifaceted body of transdisciplinary knowledge. The academic literature emphasizes the role of scientists in developing an interdisciplinary agroecology over the past ninety years. However, the practice of agroecology is much older, with deep roots in many Indigenous and peasant societies of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, Europe, and Polynesia. Although these societies never adopted the term \u201cagroecology,\u201d their time-tested practices in growing food and fiber illustrate many principles of modern agroecology.The transdisciplinary field of research on agroecology examines how agroecology contributes to equitable and sustainable food and fiber production, processing, distribution, and consumption. Agroecology builds on people\u2019s knowledge, Indigenous management systems, and local institutions through \u201cdialogues of knowledges\u201d with social science, natural science, and the humanities. The study of Indigenous and peasant agri-food systems has thus been pivotal for the development of both agroecology and anthropology.The agroecological perspective is based on a transformative vision of the relationship between people and nature. Economic anthropology has unearthed a wide diversity of systems of economic exchange that are informing work on agroecology, including the vital importance of Indigenous and peasant economies, gift economies, circular economies, subsistence, and economies of care. These are pushing agroecologists to think outside of the box of dominant commodity capitalism. Agroecology is also based on a radical conceptualization of knowledge systems, whereby work on cognitive justice, epistemic justice, Indigeneity, and decoloniality is upending the dominance of Western, scientific, Eurocentric, and patriarchal worldviews as the basis for the future of food and agriculture. Agroecology is also underpinned by radical notions of democracy and new conceptualizations of popular education, transformations in governance, and empowering forms of participation.While the transformative agenda offered by agroecology is deeply contested by proponents of industrial and corporate food and agriculture, agroecology is increasingly important in academic and policy debates on sustainable food, farming, and land use. Exploring the relationship between agroecology and anthropology is both fruitful and timely because it can help re-root agroecology\u2014which is increasingly at risk of becoming an abstract and devitalized concept\u2014in the fundamentally localized practices and culture of agri-food systems."

We probe the different characteristics of the \u201cinnovation frame\u201d and how they qualify and give meaning to agroecology. Our case study narrates the recent emergence of agroecology in the UN space and its relationship to the discursive frame of innovation. We then undertake a systematic discourse analysis of comments provided in an online consultation process on the \u201cAgroecology and Other Innovations\u201d report by the 2019 High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) in the World Committee on Food Security. We examine how different actors positioned themselves vis-a-vis the innovation frame and we analyse the discursive strategies used to advance particular political agendas. Our analysis reveals three primary sub-frames within the innovation frame (Evidence; Technology; Rights) which were deployed by both proponents and detractors of agroecology. We focus on the notion of social agency, and its different presentations, within the three sub-frames which raises a number of problematics of the innovation frame, not only for agroecology, but for sustainability transformations more widely."

Food justice has largely been examined in community-level projects and activism outside the UK. This paper uses food justice as a framework through which to analyze food policy discourse in the UK. Our analysis presents an approach to \u201creading for social justice\u201d by using the twin pillars of \u201cdistributive\u201d (how benefits and risks are shared) and \u201cprocedural\u201d justice (who is included) as analytical lenses. We apply critical discourse analysis to 20 policy documents published since the 2016 \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum. Our analysis finds that elements of both distributive and procedural justice are present, but underdeveloped or ignored across the documents. The lack of direct attention to social justice issues in the papers was not for lack of actual social justice issues, which were implicit within the discourse. The post-Brexit discourse reproduced existing power imbalances and despite occurring at a juncture where the potential for change was high, marginalized and vulnerable voices remain underrepresented. In the context of post-Brexit Britain, as well as in any political context, we argue that if food policy-making and governance are to enable a more just and sustainable food system, a more systematic approach to incorporating social justice needs to be developed. To this end, we offer a five-part approach to \u201creading for social justice\u201d when scrutinizing food and farming policy."

    "abstract": "This open access book develops a framework for advancing agroecology transformations focusing on power, politics and governance. It explores the potential of agroecology as a sustainable and socially just alternative to today's dominant food regime. Agroecology is an ecological approach to farming that addresses climate change and biodiversity loss while contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. Agroecology transformations represent a challenge to the power of corporations in controlling food system and a rejection of the industrial food systems that are at the root of many social and ecological ills. In this book the authors analyse the conditions that enable and disable agroecology's potential and present six 'domains of transformation' where it comes into conflict with the dominant food system. They argue that food sovereignty, community-self organization and a shift to bottom-up governance are critical for the transformation to a socially just and ecologically viable food system. This book will be a valuable resource to researchers, students, policy makers and professionals across multidisciplinary areas including in the fields of food politics, international development, sustainability and resilience."

    "abstract": "Universities are increasingly becoming self-referential, reflective of neoliberal values and are abandoning commitments to the public interest. In response, there have been efforts to assert a \"public scholarship\" that can contribute to the progressive transformation of society for social justice and sustainability. Yet, the performance of public scholarship within the neoliberal and elitist university is ambiguous, fraught and contested. I engage with Judith Butler's work to examine academic professionalization as performativity and unpack the disciplinary systems that shape the possibilities to perform public scholarship. I present an autoethnographic script to critically analyze the contradictions, tensions and challenges of pursuing transformative research paradigm within the professional academy. My analysis discusses three relational mediums of performativity: Internal(ized) (selves), Interpersonal (relationships) and Institutional (institutions). Each medium reflects citations of pre-existing discourse manifested in materials, customs, texts, disciplinary procedures and habits. The professional academy holds disciplinary power through these three mediums molding extractive, elitist and ultimately unjust performativity. Performativity is iterative and thus these mediums are not fixed but constituted through their performance and there are always possibilities for disruption, subversion and thus transformation. These three mediums, and their intersections, are sites for critical self-and collective reflexivity and action."

In this article, we explore how Sikkim\u2019s organic policies are affecting agroecology transitions. Drawing upon 47 interviews with Sikkimese farmers, consumers, and government officials, we explore how questions of scale are central to the Sikkimese state\u2019s organic vision. Our four-part analysis reveals how the state\u2019s move to scale up organics reflects: 1) the state\u2019s perception that areal scale and low yield are the major constraints to their organic vision. To address this perceived constraint, the state is attempting to: 2) re-scale farm production to increase yield in single commodity crops, and 3) re-scale social processes to collectivize production and marketing. 4) Education is a primary pathway through which the state seeks to reorient farmers to engage in scaled up production and a yield oriented vision of cooperation. Our results show how these different scalar processes intersect, shedding new light on debates about the role of the state in agroecology transitions.

    "abstract": "Many organizations working to promote agroecology and food sovereignty around the world are engaging in different kinds of mapping initiatives. People are mapping farms, markets, crop varieties and livestock breeds, soil fertility and water management practices, policies and more. In this guide, we focus on online interactive platforms that aim to list, communicate and\/or share \u2018what is going on where\u2019 with respect to agroecology or food sovereignty.The urge to map responds to a need to document, better understand and make visible the rapid emergence and evolution of agroecology and food sovereignty initiatives and movements. When we refer to these terms, we consider them to be interlinked visions for a food system that puts people and planet first, that is rooted in the agency and knowledge of food producers and citizens and that presents as an alternative to corporate-industrial food systems and other forms of oppressions.Proponents of these movements are looking both to strengthen what already exists, and to facilitate the further scaling up and out of food system change, through understanding and communicating what is going on, and where it is happening. For more background information on agroecology and food sovereignty see the Nyeleni Declarations on Food Sovereignty (tinyurl.com\/yyruc8ya) and on Agroecology (tinyurl.com\/y52jjlgj).In 2018-2019, we carried out a small study to explore how mapping is being used in relation to agroecology and food sovereignty. Through an examination of a selection of 30 on-line mapping initiatives, interviews with their organizers and three focus group discussions with mappers from all over the world, we set out to ask: Who is mapping? What are they mapping? And, how are they doing it? This guide was built from the insights that emerged from this process. This document aims to highlight the issues, challenges and emerging opportunities that might arise when designing mapping processes to support mapping efforts to be more powerful tools for food system change.This is just a start. We know that there is much more to learn about mapping practices that is not included here, including, for example, communication styles for social change, technical information about on-line mapping platforms, etc. We hope that you will take this forward and that future work will help to augment and improve this guide."

    "abstract": "The acceleration of ecological crises has driven a growing body of thinking on sustainability transitions. Agroecology is being promoted as an approach that can address multiple crises in the food system while addressing climate change and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. Beyond the more technical definition as, \u201cthe ecology of food systems\u201d, agroecology has a fundamentally political dimension. It is based on an aspiration towards autonomy or the agency of networks of producers and citizens to self-organize for sustainability and social justice. In this article, we use the multi-level perspective (MLP) to examine agroecology transformations. Although the MLP has been helpful in conceptualizing historic transitions, there is a need to better understand: (a) the role of and potential to self-organize in the context of power in the dominant regime, and (b) how to shift to bottom-up forms of governance\u2014a weak point in the literature. Our review analyzes the enabling and disabling conditions that shape agroecology transformations and the ability of communities to self-organize. We develop the notion of \u2018domains of transformation\u2019 as overlapping and interconnected interfaces between agroecology and the incumbent dominant regime. We present six critical domains that are important in agroecological transformations: access to natural ecosystems; knowledge and culture; systems of exchange; networks; discourse; and gender and equity. The article focuses on the dynamics of power and governance, arguing that a shift from top down technocratic approaches to bottom up forms of governance based on community-self organization across these domains has the most potential for enabling transformation for sustainability and social justice."

We suggest that that the principles and practices of food sovereignty translate into a food sovereignty research praxis. This consists of three pillars focusing on people (humanizing research relationships), power (equalizing power relations) and change (pursuing transformative orientations). This article discusses these pillars and analyzes the extent to which we were able to embody them within our projects."

This article examines the meaning, practices and potentials of \u2018transformative agroecology learning\u2019 as a collective strategy for food system transformation. Our study is based on our qualitative and action research with the European Coordination of Via Campesina to develop the European Agroecology Knowledge Exchange Network (EAKEN). This network is linked to the global network of La Via Campesina and builds on the strong experiences and traditions of popular education in Latin American peasant movements. Rather than focusing on agroecology education as a process of individual learning, we analyse how a transformative agroecology education can be strengthened as a critical repertoire of action used by social movements to advance food sovereignty. Our analysis contributes a new theory of transformative agroecology learning based on four key characteristics or qualities: horizontalism; di\u00e1logo de saberes (wisdom dialogues); combining practical and political knowledge; and building social movement networks. While these different elements of transformative agroecology learning were present across EAKEN, they were unevenly developed and, in many cases, not systematized. The framework can help to strategically and reflexively systematize and strengthen a transformative agroecology learning approach as a key building block for food sovereignty."

    "abstract": "Local sustainable food systems have captured the popular imagination as a progressive, if not radical, pillar of a sustainable food future. Yet these grassroots innovations are embedded in a dominant food regime that reflects productivist, industrial, and neoliberal policies and institutions. Understanding the relationship between these emerging grassroots efforts and the dominant food regime is of central importance in any transition to a more sustainable food system. In this study, we examine the encounters of direct farm marketers with food safety regulations and other government policies and the role of this interface in shaping the potential of local food in a wider transition to sustainable agri-food systems. This mixed methods research involved interview and survey data with farmers and ranchers in both the USA and Canada and an in-depth case study in the province of Manitoba. We identified four distinct types of interactions between government and farmers: containing, coopting, contesting, and collaborating. The inconsistent enforcement of food safety regulations is found to contain progressive efforts to change food systems. While government support programs for local food were helpful in some regards, they were often considered to be inadequate or inappropriate and thus served to coopt discourse and practice by primarily supporting initiatives that conform to more mainstream approaches. Farmers and other grassroots actors contested these food safety regulations and inadequate government support programs through both individual and collective action. Finally, farmers found ways to collaborate with governments to work towards mutually defined solutions. While containing and coopting reflect technologies of governmentality that reinforce the status quo, both collaborating and contesting reflect opportunities to affect or even transform the dominant regime by engaging in alternative economic activities as part of the 'politics of possibility'. Developing a better understanding of the nature of these interactions will help grassroots movements to create effective strategies for achieving more sustainable and just food systems."

    "date": "9 Dec 2015",
    "abstract": "Mainstream knowledge production and communication in the academy generally reflect the tenets of positivist research and predominantly embody hierarchical processes of knowledge transfer. In contrast, a transformative research paradigm is rooted in knowledge mobilization processes involving close collaboration between researchers and community actors as co-enquirers as a part of a broader agenda for progressive social change. They also involve strategic communication strategies that mobilize knowledge beyond those directly involved in the research process. We illustrate the cyclical pattern and transgressive potential of knowledge mobilization processes through a reflective case study of a participatory action research program in the Canadian Prairies. Based on this work, we present three key knowledge mobilization strategies. These include: using transmedia to exchange knowledge across a range of communication media; building bridges to invite communication amongst diverse knowledge communities; and layering to communicate knowledge at varying levels of detail. We critically examine our own practice as a contested and partial process in tension with the institutional and cultural durability of the more linear knowledge transfer paradigm. Knowledge mobilization strategies provide a framework to implement research methods, communication processes, and outcomes that are high in impact and relevant in struggles for a more just and resilient society."

    "abstract": "Civic food networks have emerged as a civil society\u2013driven response to the social, economic, and environmental shortcomings of the industrial food system. They are differentiated from other forms of alternative food networks in that they emphasize cooperation over independence, focus on participatory democratic governance over hierarchy, and serve both social and economic functions for participants. Yet there is little understanding of the processes of cooperation, particularly among farmers, in civic food networks. In this five-year action research project we documented the development of a farmer-driven civic food network in southern Manitoba on the Canadian Prairies. We explore the relations among farmers to better understand the potential of civic food networks to contribute to a more resilient and locally controlled food system. Our findings highlight the tensions and power dynamics that arise through the processes of re-embedding farmers in more interdependent relations. Fractures occurred in the group when negotiating the diverse needs and values of participants, which manifested in disputes over the balance of economic and extra-economic organizational pursuits, over the nature of the cooperative distribution model, and over quality standards. Asymmetrical power relations also emerged related to gender and generational differences. Although social embeddedness and civic governance did lead to enhanced relations and trust, these positive outcomes were unevenly distributed and coexisted with feelings of distrust and acrimony. In order to realize their full potential, proponents of civic food networks must confront difference in order to embrace the strength that comes from diversity in the process of building more resilient, and civic, food networks."

    "abstract": "The combined challenges of food insecurity, agriculture-related environmental decline, corporate concentration, and the decline of community resilience are being met by growing societal interest in developing more just and sustainable food systems. A recent emphasis on cooperation and innovative forms of collective action within the food movement invokes a community-centered approach to food provisioning where collective problem-solving and democracy take center place in the development agenda (Ikerd, 2012). Cooperative alternative food networks are becoming powerful tools for community development and important vehicles for cultivating democratically controlled food systems at multiple scales. The papers in this special issue provide an important contribution to our understanding of the function, the challenges, and the potential of collective action in enabling more just and resilient food systems.\n Cooperative alternative food networks represent a break from the competitive productivism of the dominant food economy and create new relational spaces that hold promise for overcoming the pragmatic and political limits of some of the more individualistic approaches in the local\/ sustainable food movement. These include cooperative forms of: food hubs, local food networks, farmers' markets, CSAs, box schemes, buying clubs, and value chains, along with a range of agriculture and food cooperatives owned by farmers, consumers, workers, and in emerging multistakeholder cooperative structures. With a renewed emphasis on civic governance, the resulting food-provisioning systems are based on principles of participatory democracy, solidarity, and reciprocity (Renting, Schermer, & Rossi, 2012) and provide spaces to nurture collective subjectivities required for transformative food practice and politics (Levkoe, 2011)..."

    "abstract": "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been found in 25 countries, costing billions of dollars in those affected economies, and has had profound social and environmental impacts at multiple scales of organization. As a global phenomenon, the impacts of BSE were mediated directly through the environment (animal and human health) but in Canada the indirect socioeconomic impacts of BSE were far more damaging, especially for farm households. Yet, very little research has been conducted on adaptation to the indirect impacts of global environmental change, such as those mediated through the market and governance. Our goal was to examine how farm households adapted to the Canadian BSE crisis in order to better understand rural adaptations to global zoonotic diseases and to agriculture-related global environmental change as a whole. We conducted our mixed methods research in 2004\u20132006. Data sources included 826 survey responses, 27 individual interviews and 12 group interviews with farmers and ranchers in western Canada. Factor analysis separated out responses into three general adaptation strategies: \u2018innovating\u2019 to pursue new opportunities; \u2018enduring\u2019 or adaptations that seek stability; and \u2018exiting\u2019 from beef production or agriculture altogether. Farm household and community level innovation was a crucial adaptive strategy in the absence of governmental and expert-based support. Enduring adaptations were important to farm household survival in the short term, yet \u201cchronic enduring\u201d can compromise long-term adaptive capacity. Farm exiting was highly problematic during the BSE crisis as these responses were largely unexpected and often left households more vulnerable. Government support at the farm level promoted stability, with little support provided for change-orientated adaptations. Effective farm adaptation will require support for all three types of adaptive strategies and ones that are both expert-based and grassroots in nature to enable farm households in their pursuit of pluriactive and multifunctional livelihood strategies."

    "abstract": "Inscribed epigram was a tool for the ancient Greeks to respond to personal and civic crisis. Epigrams mark relief from financial ruin or illness, success after competitive struggle; they commemorate those fallen in battle and, more generally, memorialize the dead. Callimachus\u2019 epigrams exploit this generic feature for literary effect. They present contrasting forms of response to crisis, from emotional urgency and distress to playful aloofness, disinterest and inaccessibility. There is a dramatic quality to these epigrams. Conflicting voices and perspectives establish scenarios which resist neat resolution. Author and reader are implicated in the miniature drama of Callimachean epigram. The erotic cycle thematizes emotional urgency; the sepulchral epigrams present a bleak view of death and loss. As in Greek tragedy, crisis in these epigrams is tied up with the absolute\u2014the inexorability of erotic desire, divine will and death. The act of reading, interpretation and authentication is also undercut in a series of epigrams on pseudepigrapha. Like the inscribed models he inherits, Callimachus\u2019 epigrams are not mere thought-exercises, nor do they recommend a smirking withdrawal from the world; instead, the epigrams depict a range of engaged and embodied responses to moments of crisis."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the intersection of writing and performance in early Greek poetry. It takes as a springboard the performed literacy of Callias\u2019 Alphabet Tragedy, and notes the wealth of references to books, reading, and writing across Old Comedy. Whereas the folding tablet and the papyrus roll came to represent writing from the final quarter of fifth-century BCE onwards, earlier Greek poetry draws on a broader range writing technologies as metaphors for performance, such as the skytal\u0113, the sphragis, and epigraphic inscription. Other indications that poetry is conceptualized in terms of its written medium among some Archaic poets are the distinction between song and words; references to poems as lines of text; and direct quotation of earlier poets\u2019 work. The final section of the chapter discusses how these phenomena relate to what is commonly referred to in classical scholarship as the poet\u2019s sphragis; the origins of this term are discussed, as is its suitability to the broad range of phenomena it purports to index."

    "abstract": "Vitruvius\u2019 book is chock full of bodies. It is by means of his oiled body that Dinocrates gains an audience with Alexander (2.praef.1), and by means of his naked one, and the equivalent body of water that it displaces, that Archimedes solves his well-known quandary (9.praef.9f.). The body is a living, vital thing (7.praef.2f.), even as it is a book, a body of work (7.praef.10), arising from a body of education (1.1.12). Most important of all, Vitruvius outlines a \u2018body of architecture\u2019 (corpus architecturae, 6.praef.7) to propagate and extend the reach of the deified Augustus, commander-in-chief (1.praef.1), and this idea arguably gives rise to that of the \u2018body politic\u2019 (corpus imperii). Vitruvius\u2019 text has been interpreted in terms of these bodies in important studies by Indra Kagis McEwen and John Oksanish; both authors treat the body as replete with meaning, the site of contact between architecture and the political, between text and author. This chapter adds to our understanding of the repertoire of bodies in Vitruvius by looking at those earlier incarnations of circular and square bodies which Vitruvius inherits, and in terms of which he construes the human body as a site of ideal proportions."

    "date": "May 2021",
    "abstract": "This article argues that the defamiliarization caused by extensive repetition, termed \u2018semantic satiation\u2019 in psychology, was used by ancient poets for specific effects. Five categories of repetition are identified. First, words undergo auditory deformation through syllable and sound repetition, as commonly in ancient etymologies. Second, a tradition of emphatic proper-name repetition is identified, in which the final instance of the name is given special emphasis; this tradition spans Greek and Latin poetry, and ultimately goes back to the Nireus entry in the Catalogue of Ships. Third, repetition is used for wordplay, where the final instance of the repeated term not only is emphasized but also incurs some change to its meaning or shape. Fourth, the incantatory repetition of divine names in hymns and cultic invocations amplifies a sense of divine presence behind and beyond the repetend. Fifth, repetition of half and full lines by different speakers in Old Comedy serves to undercut and parody the original sense of the repeated words. Extensive repetition in ancient literature was never merely ornamental but was used for a range of specific auditory and semantic effects with distinct and identifiable structures."

    "abstract": "Food loss and food waste (FLW) within agri-food supply chains in the developing world remains a perennial problem. This is partly due to the lack of knowledge on how business operations within supply chains contribute towards the FLW issue, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Circular Economy (CE) has been heralded as an appropriate pathway for businesses towards reduction of FLW, however, the practical realities of how the CE can be best employed remains unclear. This paper fills this knowledge gap by studying growers, distributors and retailers in the agri-food supply chain, in order to develop a Circular Capability Framework. The findings generate unique insights into FLW understandings, causes and mitigation strategies to provide a detailed, developing world relevant food waste hierarchy. The novel framework we propose can aid participation in the CE by conceptualising CE antecedents as business capability pathways, set out as eight propositions."

We explore this issue in the context of the nascent cannabis industry by examining herding among the cannabis stocks listed in the US and Canada, where the regulatory treatment of cannabis varies in its congruence with the prevailing social mood on cannabis\u2019 legalization. Canadian-listed cannabis stocks entail strong herding across all market states and sectors, alongside most capitalization-segments; conversely, herding among their US-listed counterparts is relatively limited, appearing on up-market\/high-volume days, for the smallest capitalization segment, as well as for several cannabis-sectors. Herding is present (almost always absent) around cannabis\u2019 legalization announcement-days in Canada (the US), while cross market herding between US- and Canadian-listed cannabis stocks is very weak. We attribute Canadian (US) cannabis stocks\u2019 strong (weak) herding to cannabis\u2019 more (less) mood-congruent regulatory treatment, which promotes (reduces) certainty and encourages investors to herd more (less) on them."

This study empirically tests this hypothesis in the context of online social networks by investigating the combined effects of online social networking and media reports on investment efficiency using a sample of Chinese listed firms. Our results show that the interaction of media reports and Tobin\u2019s q ratio is negatively related to corporate investment efficiency. However, the introduction of online social networks turns this relationship from a negative to a positive and statistically significant one. The combined factors significantly increase investment efficiency in non-SOEs (State Owned Enterprises) but not in SOEs. We provide evidence that online social networking effectively mitigates the negative effect of media supervision on investment efficiency, further advancing knowledge of the link of external supervision and corporate governance."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the association between growth of the firm and ownership structure under conditions of information asymmetry. The objective is to show the effects of information asymmetry (favorable vs. adverse selection) on the choice of the ownership structure that helps firms grow. Our sample includes nonfinancial firms listed in the S&P500 over the period 2000 to 2016. The dependent variable is growth of the firm measured by growth in sales. The independent variables are proxies for changes in ownership structure, individual investors, investment managers, and brokerage firms. Observations are grouped according to level of information asymmetry (high or low) using three proxies for information asymmetry: beta of return on equity (ROE), probability of default of ROE, and q ratio. The results conclude that (a) changes in ownership structure affect growth of the firm positively and (b) the effect of ownership structure is more significant and consistent at low level of information asymmetry. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, it extends the arguments of corporate governance by showing the impact of ownership structure on growth of the firm. Second, the paper offers robust evidence that growth of the firm is associated with low level of information asymmetry. Third, the paper shows that fundamental financial information can help lessen the level of information asymmetry and thus help firms grow."

Design\/methodology\/approach: The paper studies 1,878 M&A deals in the US market announced between January 1985 and December 2014. Findings: The paper finds that bidders prefer stock payments when the RRP increases. The RRP is positively related to the offer premium and the target announcement returns. Although the RRP is negatively related to the bidder announcement returns, it is positively related to the long-run performance of bidders who time the market with overvalued stocks. The results are consistent with the predictions of the misvaluation hypothesis and reference point (RP) theory. Originality\/value: The authors construct a dynamic valuation framework to explain the misvaluation hypothesis by linking M&As\u2019 misvaluation with RP theory. This paper provides direct evidence that the reference-dependence bias is prevalent for more experienced investors in major corporate investment decisions and offers fresh insights into the method of payment hypothesis."

Our framework models the time evolution of certain attributes, emerging from the practice framework, that govern individuals\u2019 decisions and their intertemporal variation. A novel feature is that preferences are able to rank other preference sets without the need to aggregate them. Instead, the selection of a preference set is treated as a decision in its own right. Our framework explains decision making paradoxes such as the disposition effect and agency cost considerations that are frequently encountered in the behavioural finance and economics literature."

However, current accounting-based models for SMEs do not account for the impact of market information on default prediction. We fill this gap in the literature by introducing a hybrid default prediction model for unlisted SMEs that uses market information of listed SMEs (comparable approach) alongside existing accounting information of unlisted SMEs. Our results suggest that the accuracy of this default prediction modelling approach in the hold-out sample, during the period of the financial crisis 2007-09 and for the entire sample-period, improves considerably. We conclude that the proposed hybrid model is a good replacement for existing standard accounting-based methods on SMEs' default prediction."

    "abstract": "This study investigates intraday herding on the Euronext, the world\u2019s first cross-border consolidated exchange. Intraday herding is significant in the Euronext as a group and presents us with size, industry and country effects. Importantly, the trading dynamics of the group's member markets significantly affect each other and can, in the case of the Netherlands, promote herding formation. Intraday herding is found to be significant before, during and after the 2007-09 financial crisis period, with its presence appearing the least strong during the crisis. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time in the literature that cross-border exchanges harbour versatile herding dynamics at intraday level, a finding which reflects recent advances in financial technology and the ongoing financial integration in Europe."

Ordinary least square models are also used to examine how ownership variables affect offer price discounts and stock market performance during the announcement of such corporate events.FindingsThe authors show that placings and open offers (OOs) are the preferred methods for issuing equity by firms with higher managerial ownership. Thus, the evidence strongly supports the prediction of the entrenched management hypothesis. Moreover, the probability of choosing a combination of placings and OOs is also found to be significantly related to issue size, offer discount, leverage, and previous stock performance. The results show that pre-issue market conditions have a significant effect on the choice of issue method with rights offers (ROs) and the combination of placings and OOs primarily utilised by firms for issuing equity during hot market periods.Originality\/valueUnlike prior SEOs\u2019 studies in the UK that predominantly concentrate on the use of ROs and placings, this study examines, for the first time, the link between OOs and the combination of placings and OOs with ownership concentration. The authors also investigate how offer price discounts are related to the firms\u2019 ownership structure, various company micro-characteristics and the wider market conditions."

Using content analysis and a panel dataset from UK FTSE 350 companies the results indicate a statistically significant relationship between board independence, as measured by the proportion of nonexecutive directors, and the quality of community disclosures, while holding constant other corporate governance and firm specific variables. The study indicates that companies with more non-executive directors are likely to disclose higher quality information on their community activities than others. This finding offers important insights to policy makers who are interested in achieving optimal board composition and furthers our understanding of the firm's interaction with its corporate and extended environment through high-quality disclosures. The originality of this paper lies in the fact that it is the first to specifically examine the relationship between outside directors and community disclosures in annual reports.

The logical structure of these contexts is analysed using proof-theoretic and model-theoretic techniques of first order paraconsistent logic. It is shown that all the contradictions that arise contain the knowledge operator K. Thus, the contradictions do not refer purely to material objects, and do not imply the existence of inconsistent, concrete, physical objects, or the inconsistency of direct sensory experience. However, the decision-making of rational self-interested agents is stymied by the appearance of such intensional contradictions. Replacing the rational self-interest axioms with axioms for an appropriate moral framework removes the inconsistencies. Rational moral choice in conflict-reflexive social contexts then becomes possible."

We find that only a small percentage of the firms identified by Datastream for short-selling are available for lending, but our results suggest that differences in profitability between unconstrained and feasible strategies are statistically insignificant. We also find that the stock borrowing fee for the majority of the strategies is normally less than 1% per annum, showing that prior UK studies, which assumed that the short-selling fee is flat at 1.50% per annum, have overestimated such cost. Overall, these results indicate that stock loan unavailability and stock borrowing fees do not explain the persistence of returns from anomaly-exploiting quantitative investment strategies in the UK stock market."

Further comparison between \"Best\" and \"Worst\" post-issue performers reveals that long-term underperformance is predominantly robust in the case of fastgrowing firms with over-optimistic management.

Our results show a continuation of the small firm premium in the UK during 1988-2004 in excess of 7% per year. We conclude that the reversal of the small firm premium documented by Dimson and Marsh (1999. Murphy's law and market anomalies. Journal of Portfolio Management 25, no. 2: 53-69) is dependent on the data sample and methodology used. The main contribution to the 7%+geometric annual premium reported here comes mainly during the years 1993 and 1999. Furthermore, exploitation of the small firm premium depends on the strategy used and in particular on the length of the holding period before rolling over the strategy. Thus, while it can be argued that an economically significant small firm anomaly continues to exist, it appears to be sample-dependent, time-varying and unreliable, and difficult to exploit in practice."

According to this premise, the pedagogic validity of any other mode of tutoring depends on how accurately it replicates the \u201cideal\u201d conditions of face-to-face interaction. Following this logic, the asynchronous writing tutorial comes last in the hierarchy of preferred tutorial formats. This chapter offers a different perspective on asynchronous online writing tutoring based on the teaching practices in place at the Centre for Academic Writing (CAW), Coventry University, England. It develops a new theoretical framework for existing tutorial practices and suggests juxtaposition through parenthetical comments as a pedagogically-sound strategy for teaching critical thinking in asynchronous online student-tutor communication and potentially in other teaching contexts. Our analysis relies on Bakhtin\u2019s understanding of language as intrinsically dialogic and applies this concept to the academic discourse of asynchronous writing tutorials."

    "abstract": "The Mariner field is a newly completed oil field in the UK continental shelf with an estimated reserve of 396 million cubic meters (2.5 billion barrels) of oil. Despite the energy security benefits its development provides to the UK, it constitutes a challenge to environmental conservation due to the existential threat of an oil spill. To plan an effective oil spill response operation, it is essential to have a sophisticated knowledge of the behavior of an oil spill in the Mariner field. More importantly, only a few studies exist that sufficiently describe the oil behavior in the Mariner field under varying environmental conditions, due to its recent development. This study aims to predict the behavior (fate and trajectory) of a heavy oil spill from the floating storage unit platform in the Mariner field. For this purpose, General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) and Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spills (ADIOS) were selected as the simulation tools to predict the trajectory and fate behaviors of oil for 5 days in October under the forcing of two different ocean models, namely Real-Time Ocean Forecasting system (RTOFS) and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Results indicated that approximately 87% of the spilled oil remained at sea after 5 days. This apparent persistent behavior of the oil on water raises a concern for marine organisms like seabirds, whose vulnerability has been found to peak in October. This implies the need for swift response action if such organisms must be protected. Furthermore, shoreline beaching was not recorded within the 5 days of observation; however, the oil slick was found to encroach the Norwegian territorial waters. This indicates the need to plan for implementation of UK\u2013Norway joint contingency plan to combat a future oil spill of this manner. This work could serve as a reference or guide to oil spill responders to inform the process of systematic environmental conservation planning in the Mariner field, UK continental shelf"

Most professionals in the SPE Production & Facilities Community graduate with variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees and many pick up applied Petroleum Engineering and Project Management knowledge on the job. The SPE Competency Matrices provide a framework for developing: 1.

A minimum Depth of Knowledge, acquired over the first 4-5 years or so, in General Engineering and their chosen (or assigned) Technical Function, in this case, either Production & Operations (P&O) or Projects, Facilities & Construction (P, F & C). The mid-career period is often a time of significant turbulence and confusion with many generalists testing-out or being assigned to a variety of roles, such as Subject Matter Experts, Team Leads, Supervisors, and Project Managers, or with other functions and\/or new companies before settling on a longer-term career path. Traditional paths for knowledge development are further complicated by an increased focus on Data Science & Engineering Analysis (DSEA), Sustainability, Decarbonization, and the Energy Transition, along with a need to reinforce our Social License to Operate. The largest corporations and major training organizations, including the SPE, provide Competency Management Tools to help practitioners identify proficiency gaps and training requirements for a current or anticipated future assignments. Similarly, the SPE provides ongoing support not only with Business Management Leadership (Soft Skills) Training but also through the Technical Communities and Sections.

    "abstract": "Crude oil is predicted to become one of the most detrimental sources of anthropogenic pollution to the marine environment. To meet Nigeria's energy need, Dangote Industries Ltd. was granted licence to build a refinery in the Lekki Free Trade Zone in 2014. There is a significant risk of oil spill from the Single Point Mooring terminal of the refinery as it shares close proximity to the Lekki deep seaport, closeness to the shoreline, sensitive environmental receptors as well as social spots (beaches and resorts). To address this gap, this study aims to design a stochastic model for oil spill prediction for the SPM terminal in order to provide an understanding of the trajectory, fate and uncertainties of spilled oil at different environmental and hydrodynamic conditions. The GNOME software was used to model oil spill trajectory in the SPM terminal while ADIOS2 modelled Bonny light crude weathering characteristics. The best guess solution and the minimum regret analysis shows the possibility of oil beaching on the coastline of Lagos, Edo and Delta State as well as the Gulf of Guinea. The fate simulation for 5 days revealed that evaporation will account for 23% and 27% of oil loss in dry and wet season while dispersion will account for 1.3% and 1.6% in the same time period. Within the same time period, Bonny light crude will form a stable emulsion that will increase the viscosity and density of oil. Also, 66% and 59% of oil was remaining after 5 days, while airborne benzene concentration evaporated in 36 hours and 12 hours in the dry and wet season respectively. The results obtained in this research work suggest that, the window of opportunity need to be utilised by stockpiling equipment and mechanical responders for shoreline clean-up to avoid the oil possibly beaching along the Coastline of Lagos, Edo and Delta state as well as countries on the Gulf of Guinea."

    "abstract": "Crude oil is predicted to become one of the most detrimental sources of anthropogenic pollution to estuaries. A comprehensive survey of oil spill literature since 1968 reveals that estuaries have received much less research attention than coastal and marine environments. There is a significant risk of oil spill on the Humber estuary as it is the main east coast port for hydrocarbon landing in the UK. However, no numerical study has been undertaken to understand oil spill dynamics in the estuary. To address this gap, we develop a high-resolution prediction model for understanding tidal influence on oil spills in a tide-dominated estuary. The oil spill prediction model comprises a hydrodynamic and oil spill model developed in TELEMAC-3D. The river boundary of the Humber estuary simulation is forced by high-resolution 15-minutes stage data. The offshore boundary is driven by 34 astronomical components obtained from a well validated model (i.e. FES2014), including estuarine water temperature and salinity. The hydrodynamic model is calibrated and validated against measured water levels obtained from Immingham port along the Humber estuary. The calibrated model shows good agreement with measured data during the validation process. The oil spill model takes into account wind speed and direction to simulate a range of oil spill scenarios in the Humber estuary. Results provide a reasonable understanding of the behaviour of oil spills, and reveal that oil slick advection in tide-dominated estuary is governed by tidal currents. Therefore, understanding the spring\/neap and flood\/ebb cycle is important to effectively deal with oil spill. This model will support operational response to future oil spills and it is equally applicable to other tide-dominated estuaries."

However, the impacts of projected climatic conditions on oil spill transport in estuarine environments have received little attention. To address these key gaps, we analyse here a range of simulations for the Humber Estuary, UK, using coupled hydrodynamic and oil spill model. These simulations indicate that, for this well-mixed macro-tidal estuary: (a) the influence of projected sea level rise and river discharge on oil slick impacted area, slick length and overall distance travelled is relatively minor (<10%); (b) magnitude of currents determines differences in dynamics between oil slicks released along the estuary length; and (c) differences in lateral current speed and direction are key determinants of the differences in the dynamics of oil slicks released along the estuary width. The implications of these findings for operational oil spill response in estuaries similar to the Humber Estuary are: (i) the need to be aware of dominant current direction in different segments of the estuary; and (ii) the need to take cognisance of the interactions between oil slicks and estuary bank and how it influences overall distance travelled by oil slicks."

Some novel findings were made: (a) there is a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in the influence of hydrodynamic conditions (tidal range, stage and river discharge) on oil slick transport; and (b) because of seasonal variation in river discharge, winter slicks released at high water did not exhibit any upstream displacement over repeated tidal cycles, while summer slicks travelled upstream into the estuary over repeated tidal cycles. The implications of these findings for operational oil spill response are: (i) the need to take cognisance of time of oil release within a tidal cycle; and (ii) the need to understand how the interaction of river discharge and tidal range influences oil slick dynamics, as this will aid responders in assessing the likely oil trajectories."

Sustainable energy future is the focus of major stakeholders around the world but this appears a complex agenda to accomplish, although it is not an insurmountable problem. The need to act now is further bolstered by the recent climate-induced disasters such as drought, flooding, hurricanes, and severe storms (Drago and Lujala 2012; Anifowose and Odubela 2015) as well as rising temperatures, including the associated humanitarian crises caused by increasingly fragile human health conditions like cardiac and respiratory illnesses (Ghazali et al. 2018). The precision of human-induced climate events, particularly extreme weather conditions, can be of great concern just as a recent study suggests that climate change increased the rainfall during the August 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, USA, by approximately 20\u201340% (Ornes 2018). Despite all the resources in that part of the world, such events tend to leave devastating socioeconomic and psychological effects on its victims. Similar scenarios in less developed climes (i.e., sub-Saharan Africa) are responsible for ~80% of fatalities and ~70% of economic losses related to natural hazards (Sidibe et al. 2019), and these areas have been deemed highly vulnerable to climate change with projected increases in droughts and flood risks due to global warming (Sidibe et al. 2020)."

    "abstract": "Climate change is expected to significantly impact on the availability of water resources in West and Central Africa through changes in rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration. Understanding these changes in this region, where surface water is fundamental for economic activity and ecosystem services, is of paramount importance. In this study, we examine the potential impacts of climate variability and change on hydrological systems by the mid-21st century in West and Central Africa, as well as the uncertainties in the different climate-impact modelling pathways. Simulations from nine global climate models downscaled using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate model (RCA4) are evaluated and subsequently bias-corrected using a nonparametric trend-preserving quantile mapping approach. We then use two conceptual hydrological models (GR2M and IHACRES), and a regression-based model built upon multi-timescale sea surface temperatures and streamflow teleconnections, to understand hydrological processes at the subcontinental scale and provide hydrological predictions for the near-term future (2020-2050) under the RCP4.5emission scenario.The results highlight a zonal contrast in future precipitation between western (dry) and eastern (wet) Sahel, and a robust signal in rising temperature, suggesting an increase in potential evapotranspiration, across the multi-model ensemble. Overall, across the region, a significant increase in discharge (~+5%) is expected by the mid-21st century, albeit with high uncertainties reported over most of Central Equatorial Africa inherent to climate models and gridded observation data quality. Interestingly, in this region, teleconnections-based regression models tend to be an alternative to hydrological models."

After the Second World War, the industrial revolution necessitated the search for a new approach to manage environmental pollution emanating from construction, manufacturing, building, and industrial activities. Consequently, EIA evolved as part of the efforts to improve environmental awareness and environmental education through the US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, which mandates that an EIA must be undertaken for projects that have potentially significant impacts on the quality of human environment (IOCGP 2003, p. 232). Thereon, many regional and international frameworks on EIA have evolved. These include the EU Directive on EIA in 1985 (Directive85\/337\/EEC), UN convention on EIA in a transboundary context (i.e., Espoo 1991), the UN Conference on Environment and Development (i.e., Agenda 21), and the Rio declaration on environment in 1992. To date, EIA has been adapted or adopted into local legislations and implementation frameworks in virtually all the 193 countries of the United Nations."

    "abstract": "Droughts and floods are responsible for ~ 80% of fatalities, and ~70% of economic losses related to natural hazards in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rainfall variability which is driven by interannual to multi-decadal climate fluctuations, here underpins these issues but is also crucial to agriculture and livelihoods. However, due to data scarcity, little is known about the impact of these climatic fluctuations and catchment properties on streamflow variability. Therefore, in this study, using a newly reconstructed streamflow dataset, we aim to extend understanding of hydrological variability through investigation of key large-scale controls which modulate climate-river flows relationships at the subcontinental scale. Modes of variability are extracted using continuous wavelet transform and maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform. We first assess the relative importance of catchment properties in modulating streamflow and modes of variability, before examining teleconnections with climate variables from different datasets (ERSST.v5 and 20CR.v2). The results underline the importance of interannual components of river flow along the Gulf of Guinea and the coastal regions of Central Africa where annual rainfall amounts are higher, and runoff is mostly generated from surface and sub-surface processes. In contrast, river flows along the Sahelian band show stronger multi-decadal components: this partly reflects the prominent role of geological formations in modulating high frequency rainfall signals. These modes of variability (also significantly detected in rainfall) are likely related to anomalies in sea-surface temperature (SST) anomaly patterns and associated atmospheric circulations, which together modulate the West African monsoon. Clarifying the picture of streamflow variability in western and Central Africa thus opens up the prospect for improved future predictions for streamflow and water resources in data scarce environments."

    "abstract": "This paper provides some new insights into the variability and severity of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants from the first ever environmental audit of Nigeria's downstream oil facilities. Petroleum facility operation is the backbone of energy supply all over the world but this process is not without potentially avoidable water pollution incidents. Meanwhile, past studies tend to ignore patterns of pollution parameters at the national scale and are often limited in scope and coverage. To address this research gap, Principal Component Analysis and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied to evaluate the variability in \u2018national\u2019 pollution data to tease-out novel patterns that best discriminate between groups of pipeline facility network across Nigeria's downstream sector. The key results are (a) a mix of strong and weak statistically significant (p-value<0.001) and positive correlation between pollutants across three pipeline regions; (b) the main eigenvector statistically explains 71.5% of the variance found in the \u2018national\u2019 pollution parameters; and (c) according to the hierarchical cluster analyses, we now know that there is an incoherent pattern from the group data and a rather weak association which suggest that the type of oil facility systems in operation or their products have no effect on the severity of hydrocarbon pollution parameters found in water samples across the three regions. The implication of these results is that it might be cost-effective to apply a uniform approach in responding to future petroleum water contamination depending on site specific hazards posed by toxicity level, temporal nature of detected chemicals and human exposure. Future study should consider the use of carbon stable isotope ratios to assess variances in hydrocarbon contamination in water bodies, and tailor this for cost-effective national response given the aforementioned caveats. This can guarantee a more sustainable operations and enhance response to water pollution incidents. The study approach and, possibly its outcomes, could be a useful starting point for nations with new oil and gas discoveries such as Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda, The Gambia, Liberia and so on."

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, regions of West and Central Africa have experienced different and significant changes in climatic patterns, which have significantly impacted hydrological regimes. Such impacts, however, are not fully understood at the regional scale, largely because of scarce hydroclimatic data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to (a) assemble a new, robust, reconstructed streamflow dataset of 152 gauging stations; (b) quantify changes in streamflow over 1950 \u2013 2005 period, using these newly reconstructed datasets; (c) significantly reveal trends and variability in streamflow over West and Central Africa based on new reconstructions; and (d) assess the robustness of this dataset by comparing the results with those identified in key climatic drivers (e.g. precipitation and temperature) over the region. Gap filling methods applied to monthly time series (1950-2005) yielded robust results (median Kling-Gupta Efficiency >0.75). The study underlines a good agreement between precipitation and streamflow trends and reveals contrasts between western Africa (negative trends) and Central Africa (positive trends) in the 1950s and 1960s. Homogenous dry conditions of the 1970s and 1980s, characterized by reduced significant negative trends resulting from quasi-decadal modulations of the trend, are replaced by wetter conditions in the recent period (1993-2005). The effect of this rainfall recovery (which extends to West and Central Africa) on increased river flows are further amplified by land use change in some Sahelian basins. This is partially offset, however, by higher potential evapotranspiration rates over parts of Niger and Nigeria. Crucially, the new reconstructed streamflow datasets presented here will be available for both the scientific community and water resource managers."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model for data access and sharing within a spatial data infrastructure. Spatial data infrastructure, often proposed at national level, refers to the enabling of wider access to geographical data so that better knowledge can be generated to promote social, environmental and economic benefits. A good spatial data infrastructure includes people, policies, tools, methods and data. Many national spatial data infrastructure projects have included a clearing house, where meta-data can be searched in order to discover digital resources. While this approach can have certain advantages, there are also problems. Particularly the centralised clearing house has been shown to be hard to realise. In this paper, instead of a centralised top-down approach, we advocate a scalable, bottom-up distributed approach as the core of a spatial data infrastructure and demonstrate its feasibility. The advantage of this approach is that the spatial data infrastructure can grow organically without the need of a centralised entity and thus access to spatial data can be achieved sooner bringing with it environmental and economic benefits. We show how quality and security can be maintained within the approach. The National Geospatial Data Infrastructure (NGDI) project of Nigeria, together with the application area of environmental impact analysis, is used as a case study."

Potential oil spills and their impact on the environment and the economy are of concern. As was seen in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, information from the United States Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS\u00ae) was key in the response. A robust IOOS-like system in the Gulf of Guinea could support oil spill response and enhance the existing Global Ocean Observing System for Africa (GOOS for Africa). There is great potential within the Gulf of Guinea for regional stakeholder resources to coordinate systematic metocean and coastal data, and share these data across the West, Central and Southern African countries. Through such coordinated efforts, the society benefits from the development of a \"blue economy\" and from improved disaster response more than from individual observations. Drawing from the examples in the Gulf of Mexico, the paper integrates the lessons from IOOS types of assets into useful response efforts for the Gulf of Guinea area. Responders, decision makers, scientists and the public all benefit from improved access to environmental information and forecasts. We include a \"mock up\" of how an IOOS asset would support scientific spill response in the Gulf of Guinea."

    "abstract": "Oil spills have been identified as a common consequence of the exploration and production of petroleum resources. This is likely to increase with the continuous rise in demand for petroleum and petroleum products. The Clair oilfield holds the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon accumulation in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS), indicating its importance to the future of UK production strategy. Significant developments made in oil spill modelling in the last twenty years suggest the need for an updated study on the behaviour of a Clair oil spill. This study aims to design an updated stochastic model for oil spill prediction in the Clair Oilfield in order to provide an understanding of the trajectory, fate and uncertainties of spilled oil at varying environmental conditions. The GNOME software was employed to model the oil spill trajectory in the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and ADIOS2 for modelling the Clair oil spill weathering processes. \"Minimum regret\" analysis suggests that spills allowed to persist will cross the Norway\/UK boundary line and move further towards the Norwegian coastline. Furthermore, there is the possibility of oil beaching along the coast of the Shetland Island if the oil spill occurs. The weathering models revealed that evaporation will account for about 15% of the oil lost in both summer and winter while dispersion will account for 15% and 30% of the oil lost in summer and winter respectively. Within the 5-day scenario considered the Clair oil forms a meso-stable emulsion resulting in a 100 times increase in the viscosity of the oil and a slight increase in density. Furthermore, airborne benzene concentration evaporated within 15 hours and 6 hours in summer and winter respectively. The results obtained in this study suggest that equipment should be stockpiled as well as mechanical responders for near shore intervention to prevent and tackle possible beaching along the Shetland island coast and the Norwegian coast"

However, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can serve as a check for inconsistencies and tool for aggregation of the different experts\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 opinions on impact assessment. This study investigated the integration of AHP into EIA impact significance determination to assess the effect of consistency and inconsistency in stakeholder judgments. A case study to investigate an application of the proposed method in a major oil pipeline\u2019s replacement project is presented. It was observed that the opinions of both experts and stakeholders were uniform on some impacts such as land use, water contamination and an increase in the cost of health services, representing 18.75% of all the identified impacts. Conversely, there were differences in opinions on other impacts revealing what could be a cause of serious disagreement between the company and the community. It was also observed that, although consistency in judgment is critical, it is not always very easy to obtain when dealing with many stakeholders. This integration demonstrated the ability of AHP to serve as an excellent decision aid for managers during environmental impact assessment. This could also help authorities prioritise risk management plan and allocate resources optimally when dealing with identified impacts of a project."

    "abstract": "The global economy relies heavily on oil and gas resources. However, hydrocarbon exploitation projects can cause significant impacts on the environment. But despite the production of numerous Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) to identify\/mitigate such impacts, no study has specifically assessed the quality of EISs for both onshore and offshore oil and gas projects, with tested hypotheses. To address this research gap, our paper, for the first time, develops a modified Lee and Colley evaluation model to assess the quality of 19 sampled oil and gas project EISs produced from 1998 to 2008 in Nigeria. Our findings show that Project Description and Communication of Results are the main areas of strength. However, Environmental Impact Prediction, and Project Decommissioning, were among the key areas requiring attention. A key finding, though, is that Mann-Whitney tests suggest that there is no evidence that the quality of EISs for the latter period (2004\u20132008) is higher than that of the earlier period (1998\u20132004). We suggest that periodic systematic review of the quality of submitted\/approved EISs (c. every 3\u20135 years) should be established to monitor trends in EIS quality and identify strong and weak areas. This would help to drive continual improvement in both the EIA processes and the resultant EISs of technical engineering projects. Such reviews have the potential to illuminate some of the underlying problems of, and solutions to, oil and gas exploration, production and transportation, and their related environmental impacts. This suggested change would also be useful internationally, including for the burgeoning exploration and production of unconventional hydrocarbon resources.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Science of The Total Environment.

    "abstract": "Climate change impacts are increasingly becoming more evident e.g. through heavy rainfall episodes and subsequent flooding. Methane is a significant greenhouse gas that has been linked to these impacts and the oil and gas industry is a major source of anthropogenic methane emission. Recent studies have suggested that the tropical region hold some unexpectedly high methane concentration and that the recent changes in the global methane burden are poorly understood. To address this research gap, we present a first effort to quantify methane emissions from one of the most vulnerable oil and gas infrastructures in Nigeria (a tropical country). A combination of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier-1 approach and an adapted Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model was used to estimate methane emissions from the system 2C transport pipeline. We then tested the hypothesis of no significant change in methane emissions trend from the pipeline using the between group t-test inferential analysis. Key findings include: (a) a crude oil throughput of 55,143 to 1,500,500 barrels (8767 to 238,561 m3) emitted methane ranging from 0.04734 to 1.288MT (\u00b1 50 to 200%) respectively, and (b) surprisingly, methane emissions along the system 2C pipeline seem to have continued without significant change between 2005, and 2008 to 2012 despite the low crude oil throughput in 2009. This indicates the likelihood of continuous but rising methane emissions from the pipeline network over a six-year period; and only further research can ascertain if similar trend can be observed elsewhere in the tropical region. These findings are unique and contribute to the current global debate on methane emissions from the largely unmonitored tropical region. Therefore, we recommend that stakeholders should set up a study plan for the identification and continuous monitoring of methane emissions from the key oil and gas infrastructure and explore opportunities for geoengineering applications as part of climate change mitigation. Coordinated engagement in international schemes such as the Natural Gas STAR program, Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Methane Initiative amongst others would promote strategic and measurable methane reduction plans in Nigeria and other countries within\/outside the tropical region."

    "abstract": "The deliberate damaging of oil pipelines (interdiction) is a key problem in the global petroleum industry and tends to have a strong spatial identity. It also has local, national and international implications for energy security and susceptible environmental receptors. This paper specifically focuses on Nigeria, a country often affected by complex environmental problems associated with oil and gas activities. Partly because Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Nigeria was only promulgated in 1992, there has been no specific study of pipeline interdiction and how it could be better addressed in future EIAs, especially at river crossings where oil pollution is usually significant. Therefore through a careful collation of data from different sources, this paper for the first time aims to: (1) evaluate how pipeline interdiction has been addressed in sampled EIAs; (2) assess interdiction trend per unit of pipeline length over a 16-year period; (3) identify points on pipeline river crossings that are especially sensitive to oil spills. A linearly-weighted equation was used to estimate interdiction per 1000 pipeline kilometres per year. River network and pipeline shapefiles were geoprocessed in ArcGIS 9.2 to identify river crossing locations and the spatiotemporal trend of interdiction was plotted. Key findings include: (a) high interdiction rates per 1000 pipeline kilometres ranging from 1.4 to 735 per year; (b) at least 115 pipeline river crossing locations exist in Nigeria and constitute potential oil-spill hazards; (c) these hitherto unavailable pipeline river crossing data unsurprisingly show the majority of such locations are within southern Nigeria. These results should guide future oilfield developments, including oil production and transportation facility projects, through efficient scoping and mitigation strategies. We argue that there is a need for systematic requirements to effectively address the anticipation\/mitigation of future pipeline impacts in EIAs to better support oil spill contingency planning and reduce environmental problems."

Therefore, this study designed a deterministic model for oil spill trajectory simulation using the Saltpond oilfield (Ghana) as study location. The main objectives were to: (a) design a diagnostic GNOME model to configure and generate localised oil spill scenarios; (b) model different oil spill scenarios and weathering profiles for varying environmental conditions e.g. wet\/dry seasons, different currents and wind conditions; and (c)  Predict the \u2018minimum regret\u2019 Splots as a precautionary principle. A combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach involving a hydrodynamic model containing localised environmental parameters from the Saltpond oilfield was utilised. The General NOAA Operating Modelling Environment (GNOME) based on a C++ programming language was used to execute the analyses. In addition, the ADIOS2 oil weathering tool was used to estimate the oil budget for different spill quantities based on the physical and chemical properties of Ghana\u2019s sweet light crude at Saltpond field. The key findings are: 5000 and 10,000 barrels of spilled oil beached after a minimum of 12 hours in 97% of the scenarios under the influence of winds from the South. Wind speeds leading to beaching were 35.7% for 14 and 16 knots, 14.3% for 17 knots and 7.1% for 15 and 20 knots respectively. Weathering results showed a maximum of 43% of spilled oil evaporated after 116 hours with a minimum and maximum dispersal of 1% and 7% respectively. This study, for the first time, has provided hitherto unavailable analysis and information on oil spill transport forecasting and trajectory simulation for the Saltpond Oilfield in Ghana which environmental managers\/engineers would find readily useful in responding to future oil spill disasters.  The approach and methodology used in this study could also be adapted for other offshore regions in Ghana and West Africa."

    "abstract": "Oil spills pose significant environmental risks to river resources and ecosystem services, particularly at Pipeline River crossing locations. Flow duration curves (FDC) can provide useful information for water resource and environmental managers to support mainly river oil spill contingency planning and possibly, response efforts. Yet, no study appears to have explored the potentials of flow duration analysis in managing river oil spills. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap using river discharge Q (m 3 s -1) time-series data (1914 to 2008) at Lokoja (on the River Niger - one of the world's largest river systems) to explore: (a) the percent of time a given flow is equaled or exceeded per annum; and (b) its implication for river oil spill management. The log cycle analysis technique was used to design the FDC. Ln regression involving the plotting of mean velocity (m s -1) against mean Q at Lokoja was used to interpret possible implications of Q percentiles (i.e. Q 5, Q 25, Q 50, Q 75, Q 95) from the FDC. Result suggests the exceedance probability of flows as follows: 'very high flows' -18 days, 'high flows' -91 days, 'medium flows' -183 days, 'low flows' -274 days, and 'very low flows' -347 days year-1. Based on the Q percentiles, estimated oil travel times (km hr -1) were suggested as 7.32, 5.11, 3.31, 2.56 and 0.58 respectively. These are vital information for effective contingency planning, boom deployment and the safeguard of downstream resources. As part of contingency planning, the results could provide details on the type\/quantity of response materials that may be needed for different flow magnitudes."

    "abstract": "Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is designed to anticipate and mitigate project impacts starting from the front-end engineering design stage to decommissioning. To further our understanding of the gaps between EIA predictions and the actual impacts of oil and gas projects, it may be plausible to independently review the quality of projects' EISs. There is currently no published academic literature on the role of EIS quality as a precursor to socio-environmental consequences of oil and gas exploration, production and transportation. The only known study of EIS quality in the oil industry was commissioned by UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). This paper examines the quality of nineteen sampled EISs using the Lee and Colley model. The model was adapted based on local and international best practices, peculiarity of oil and gas projects and learning from past research. The European Commission checklist on EIA-EIS quality (2001) and World Bank EA Sourcebook (Energy & Industry) (1999) were also consulted. Lee and Colley model was modified by adding a new review area on decommissioning\/abandonment. Preliminary findings reveal a marginal but not significant improvement in the quality of sampled EISs. The analysis suggests 53% of the sampled EISs were of satisfactory quality. The main weakness common to about 80% of sampled EIS include decommissioning, impact evaluation and impact prediction. There is the problem of environmental stasis which has resulted in impacts not being predicted as deviation from baseline condition. Key areas of strength include descriptive and presentational tasks. Independent review of oil and gas project EISs is imperative given the recent Gulf of Mexico Macondo oilfield deepwater disaster. Preliminary investigations into this disaster suggest the drilling operation was exempted from detailed EIS. Independent quality review of EISs could help restore public confidence in the oil industry."

    "abstract": "Understanding oil slick migration in rivers is important for effective spill response because rivers provide essential services for household purposes e.g. fisheries, water supply, transport, socio-cultural activities and recreation. Rivers constitute the second most important source of household water supply in Nigeria. Yet, rivers are major receptors of oil pollution. This paper focuses specifically on oil Pipeline River crossing upstream of Lokoja (on the Niger River) to demonstrate likely oil slick migration trend, herein referred to as oil travel time (OTT). An OTT describes the average time it takes lead oil plume to arrive at a downstream destination. The primary objective of this paper is to facilitate timely warning for water and environmental managers through OTT prediction; and, provide valuable information for contingency planning, monitoring and impact assessment. Method applied is the Hydraulic Geometry (HG) model using historic mean daily discharge MDQ (m3 s-1) (1980-2008), hydraulic characteristics: width w (m), mean depth d (d), mean velocity v (m s-1) and 3% \u2018differential oil-water velocity' of wind speed (m s-1) at Lokoja. Results suggest that any spilled oil at the pipeline river crossing is likely to hit key receptors (e.g. water reservoir ~34km downstream) in 4 hours during high flow and takes ~9 days to reach Onitsha (~240km downstream) during low flow. This prediction is based on at-a-station HG using logarithmic regression (R2 = 0.8447). Power regression was also used but had weaker R2 value of 0.6175; hence the former appears more reliable. The absence of adequate data for other cross-sections downstream of the lower Niger River makes downstream HG less useful in this study. There is urgent need for more data points and systematic survey along the lower Niger to enhance downstream HG OTT prediction. This study represents the first known attempt to predict OTT in Nigerian Rivers using historic intermediate environmental data, though there have been a number of studies on marine\/coastal oil spill incidents. This level of analysis is expected in every EIA where oil transport pipeline crosses rivers\/streams. It is hoped that the results and the models used in this study would form useful basis for impact assessment in the ongoing efforts to explore oil at the inland river basins of Nigeria known as Nigerian Frontier Inland Sedimentary Basins (NFISB)."

    "abstract": "The case of Lagos and its environs is presented because of its strategic importance to Nigeria. Lagos is Africa\u2019s most populous city and is endowed with four ports which accounts for over 50% of Nigeria\u2019s seaborne trade; including refined oil importation through the Atlas Cove depot (Fig. 1 & 2). Transport\npipeline interdiction (see, Church et al. 2004) is the deliberate damaging of oil pipelines by third-party(s). Interdiction is a major problem in Nigeria, resulting in pollution of environmental receptors (water, air, land), fire incidents with high fatality cases and loss of properties. Apart from interdiction (which, dependent on one\u2019s view, may be interpreted as sabotage, theft or vandalism), there are other causes of pipeline breaks such as corrosion, mechanical failure or rupture (Lyons 2002, Capelle et al. 2008, Lilly et al. 2007). This paper aims to examine the problem of pipeline interdiction in Nigeria with specific focus on Mosimi region (Lagos). It further attempts to answer the question; what risk does petroleum transport infrastructure pose for an urban environment like Lagos? Environmental footprint in the context of this paper refers to pollution and associated consequences caused by interdiction and other aspects of oil transport operations. These footprints can be assessed by how well crude\/refined products or oil waste are absorbed into the contiguous environment where the infrastructures are located. Petroleum transport infrastructure in the context of this article includes pipelines, depots, pump-stations, marine station, boosters, refineries and other associated accessories"

To this effect, many innovative individual, corporate and\/or joint-government commissioned\nresearch projects have been carried out to address the situation. Also, there have been a number of reported cases of interdiction problems (i.e. sabotage or vandalism) along pipeline infrastructure which is one of the key sources of pollution in the area. However, from the Transport Geography perspective (i.e. distance, accessibility, spatial interaction and land use), little work has been done to critically assess individual sources of environmental pollution such as\npipeline infrastructure operations within the context of post-project appraisal phases of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) protocols or Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). This paper identifies some significant limitations in EIA\/ESIA protocols in such environments, and proposes a number of improvements to minimize oil industry environmental impacts. In particular, this paper attempts to lay the foundations to enhance EIA\/ESIA and reduce\nthe impacts of environmental pollution by (a) the inclusion of GIS and remote sensing, especially for post-project appraisal of pipeline operations and (b) integrating concepts from transport geography models."

However, there is currently little prospect for conflict resolution as the Cameroon government appears intent on ignoring limited international pressure, maintaining the charade that the \u2018security crisis\u2019 is over and reconstruction is underway, while continuing its counter-insurgency strategy to militarily defeat the armed separatist groups. We note that, while the desire for peace is profound, the political status quo is no longer tolerable nor acceptable, with conflict resolution dependent on political changes that provide, at a minimum, the Anglophone regions with greater autonomy and protection of their particular identity and institutions."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the current conflict in Anglophone Cameroon and examines the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) in conflict resolution. In doing so, it explores a paradox in the peacebuilding literature. On the one hand, the \u2018local turn\u2019 in peacebuilding has emphasised a bottom-up approach that highlights the role of CSOs. On the other hand, the literature on \u2018shrinking civic space\u2019 has demonstrated how space for CSOs\u2019 activities has become increasingly restricted, especially in authoritarian contexts like Cameroon. The article investigates the contributions of CSOs to conflict resolution, the constraints faced, and their responses in turn to mitigate such constraints. CSOs\u2019 contribution to conflict resolution is at least three-fold: to engage with most-affected communities and build an evidence base of the conflict\u2019s adverse consequences for civilians; to draw national and international attention to the conflict; and to maintain pressure for a negotiated settlement through public protests and interactions with both government and non-state armed groups. Despite facing intimidation and violence at times, CSOs have responded in innovative ways that demonstrate examples of adaptation and resistance to shrinking civic space."

    "abstract": "With over 3000 people killed, more than 200 villages burnt, over 750,000 people internally displaced and 1.3 million people in need of assistance, there is an urgent need to resolve the Cameroon Anglophone conflict. This is a highly neglected conflict between the Cameroonian military forces and armed separatist groups which has been ongoing since October 2017. The armed separatist groups are fighting for an independent state called \u2018Ambazonia\u2019, comprising the country\u2019s two English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions. This report captures the voices and experiences of local civil society organisations (CSOs) \u2013 an important but largely marginalised voice \u2013 in their efforts towards conflict resolution in a challenging environment.  Findings stem from an empirical pilot study conducted by Coventry University\u2019s Centre for Trust, Peace and Social Relations (CTPSR) and partners from the African Leadership Centre, Nairobi, and the University of Buea (UB), Cameroon. The pilot study brought together 15 CSOs from the two English-speaking regions in a one-day workshop to learn about their organisations\u2019 experiences in conflict resolution, the challenges they faced, and the strategies adopted to overcome such challenges. The workshop discussions were then followed up with six in-depth interviews with selected CSO leaders. The voices and experiences of the diverse CSOs are examined within the framework of two contrasting discourses: the important role of CSOs in conflict resolution and the phenomenon of \u2018shrinking civic space\u2019 for CSO action.The study notes that while the operational structures of CSOs are increasingly constrained by government restrictions and by security threats stemming from the civil war situation, local CSOs from the affected English-speaking regions of Cameroon have, nonetheless, made significant efforts to resolve the conflict. These issues are elaborated in this report, which is laid out in seven sections.The introduction briefly examines the current conflict and efforts towards conflict resolution before justifying the need to examine the role of local CSOs within the context of increasing restriction of civic space in Cameroon. It concludes by briefly elaborating on the research methods. Thereafter Section Two locates the research within two strands of relevant scholarly literature: the local turn in the conflict resolution literature towards \u2018peacebuilding from below\u2019; and that of \u2018shrinking civic space\u2019 for civil society activities. The third section provides the historical background to the longstanding \u2018Anglophone problem\u2019 in Cameroon that morphed into a civil war in 2017 and which has pitted Cameroonian government forces against separatist armed groups in the English-speaking regions. It notes that the current conflict has its roots in the legacies that stem from Cameroon\u2019s unique colonial history and the nature of post-independence settlements. The subsequent empirical sections focus on the three main objectives of this pilot study: Section Four on the contributions of CSOs in conflict resolution; Section Five on the challenges they face; and Section Six on the strategies that CSOs adopt to counter the civic restrictions and to contribute to conflict resolution efforts. Section Seven concludes by summarising the findings, noting the following:\u2022\tCSOs within the English-speaking regions of Cameroon are in a difficult and paradoxical situation that pits their important role in peacebuilding from below within the context of shrinking civic space for their actions. Such restrictions are due to a tightening of government legislation and military crackdown on protests and gatherings that have not received written authorisation.\u2022\tCSOs have reoriented their activities towards resolution of the conflict by engaging with most-affected communities to provide humanitarian relief and psychosocial support, by building an evidence base of human rights violations and war crimes by both parties, and by highlighting the conflict\u2019s adverse consequences for citizens.\u2022\tCSOs have worked to rally community support, built coalitions with other CSOs and networked with international NGOs in advocacy work towards peaceful resolution of the conflict. Such strategies have enabled CSOs to counter shrinking civic space and remain visible as conflict resolution actors.\u2022\tWorking through coalitions and interacting with both government and non-state armed actors has given CSOs more power to maintain pressure for conflict resolution.\u2022\tDialogue with local communities has also enabled CSOs to act as mediators in bottom-up processes, enhancing local agency and bringing the views of those affected into policy spaces"

    "abstract": "Many African states have generally opposed 'foreign' interventions. With the adoption of the AU's Constitutive Act, Article 4 (h) in 2000 and the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework in 2008, the principles of intervention has mutated from non-interference to non-indifference. The establishment of the African Standby Force (ASF) and subsequently the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) are part of the grand scheme by African countries to respond to conflicts on the continent in a timely and efficient manner especially when it threatens regional security. What characterizes the literature on interventions involving African state(s) are conceptions initiated on illfounded assumptions, arbitrariness and in extreme cases failure. What is presented asexplaining such failures is the often un-nuanced discourse about the inability of the African state to intervene, sustain and restore a post-conflict country to the path of peace and development. This paper presents a counterfactual argument about the unique agency of African countries in intervening in crises. Using the AU's intervention in Somalia and Mali and the ECOWAS intervention in Guinea Bissau as empirical cases, this chapter explores such potentially symbiotic relationships between the causes and consequences of interventions, current third-party interventions and how it differs from those of the past and the different typologies of multilateral interventions in the post-cold war period."

For decades, countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Guinea- Bissau were crippled by conflicts and civil strife in which violence and incessant killings were prevalent. While violent conflicts are declining in the sub-region, recent insurgencies in the Sahelregion affecting the West African countries of Mali, Niger and Mauritania and low intensity conflicts surging within notably stable countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal sendsalarming signals of the possible re-surfacing of internal and regional violent conflicts. These conflicts are often hinged on several factors including poverty, human rights violations, badgovernance and corruption, ethnic marginalization and small arms proliferation. Although many actors including the ECOWAS, civil society and international community have been making efforts, conflicts continue to persist in the sub-region and their resolution is often protracted. This paper posits that the poor understanding of the fundamental causes of West Africa\u2019s violent conflicts and civil strife would likely cause the sub-region to continue experiencing and suffering the brunt of these violent wars."

    "abstract": "The financialization of everyday life has received considerable attention since the 2008 global financial crisis. Financialization is thought to have created active financial subjects through the ability to participate in mainstream financial services. While the lived experience of these mainstream financial subjects has been the subject of close scrutiny, the experiences of financial subjects at the financial fringe have been rarely considered. In the UK, for example, the introduction of High-Cost, Short-Term Credit [HCSTC] or payday loan regulation was designed to protect vulnerable people from accessing unaffordable credit. Exploring the impact of HCSTC regulation is important due to the dramatic decline of the high-cost credit market which helped meet essential needs in an era of austerity. As such, the paper examines the impact of the HCSTC regulation on sixty-four financially marginalized individuals in the UK that are unable to access payday loans. First, we identify the range of socioeconomic strategies that individuals employ to manage their finances to create a typology of financial subjectivity at the financial fringe. Second, we demonstrate how the temporal and precarious nature of financial inclusion at the financial fringe adds nuance to existing debates of the everyday lived experience of financialization."

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the academic contributions and policy impacts economic geographers have made to understanding the geographical processes inherent in banking operations and practices, and shows why exploring banking and consumer credit is important. It discusses the roles and relationships between banks and citizens through consumer credit. Since the 1990s, geographers have been at the forefront of research around banking and credit, particularly financial exclusion. Advances in information communication technologies enabled telephone- and internet-based banking, centralizing credit decision-making, thereby replacing the need for more expensive and time consuming face-to-face, in-branch relationship banking. Inclusive credit scoring attempts to add value to traditional credit scoring models by making new forms of data available so that individuals can access affordable and fair sources of credit. Economic geographers have been at the forefront of research on the uneven geographies of finance and consumer credit since the 1970s, providing nuanced understandings of consumer credit landscape and solutions that enable policy-makers to address financial exclusion."

    "abstract": "There is much debate about the impact of personal finance education on financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, particularly based on studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (US). This paper makes a contribution to this debate, drawing on analysis of a survey of 521 undergraduate students at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) in Indonesia in 2015. As part of that study, we measured the impact of a 14-week personal finance education course on financialknowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Our findings show that, when controlling for other factors, the personal finance course did, indeed, have a positive and statistically significant impact on financial knowledge. However, there was no statistically significant impact of the course on financial attitudes or behaviour. Our analysis also shows that family financial socialisation was an important driver of financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour while other drivers of financial behaviourincluded income, work experience, year\/field of study and discussing money with friends. We do not argue here that formal financial education is unimportant but that its role in changing attitudes and behaviour should be considered carefully if this is, indeed, its aim."

However, this approach fails to fully consider the emotional factors that influence the financial decision-making process. This study examines how emotions shape these decisions, drawing on the concept of \u2018muddling through\u2019 to understand the complex process to be navigated. Data are drawn from 78 in-depth interviews with consumers who were financially \u2018struggling and squeezed\u2019. \u2018Integral\u2019 and \u2018incidental\u2019 emotions were influential both in assisting the decision-making process and in introducing biases that could lead to harm. Consumers were able to rationalize their decisions, even though they might not be economically optimal in the longer term. Muddling through theory is extended by explaining the role of emotions within it. New insights into the interaction between emotions that are \u2018integral\u2019 or \u2018incidental\u2019 to decision-making lead to policy and practice recommendations."

However, this approach has been criticised for not fully considering the behavioural factors that influence how consumers manage their money. Through a qualitative study of consumer financial decision-making, we gain deeper empirical insights into the emotions, context, and other behavioural factors which drive financial behaviours. We contribute conceptually by extending thinking on \u2018muddling through\u2019 decision- making to the personal finance context, revealing showing that what consumers consider to be rational may not align with an economic view of rationality. Questions are raised about whether whether current policy is sufficiently aligned with the factors driving consumer financial behaviour and the implications are considered."

As a result, the link between IPR strength and multinational enterprises\u2019 (MNEs) propensity to invest is unproven and seemingly dependent on a number of factors. We critically review the theory and evidence of the influence of IPRs on FDI and MNEs\u2019 investment location (country) decisions both to \u2018take stock\u2019 of existing knowledge of this relationship and, by identifying gaps in, and shortcomings of prior work, develop a fruitful research agenda. We find that existing empirical work on the IPR-FDI nexus, though skewed in favour of a positive relationship between IPR protection and FDI, is fragmented, inconclusive and unable to square the conflicting theoretical predictions on how the strength of IPRs can affect MNEs\u2019 FDI location decisions. Several issues and challenges are highlighted to explain the difficulties of the collective body of past empirical work to provide a definite answer to the question of the impact of IPRs on FDI, from which valuable recommendations are proposed to guide future applied research."

There is little doubt that, in a number of advanced economies, responsibility for long-term financial well-being is being shifted from the state to the individual citizen. This study provides an expos\u00e9 of financial planning and whether it is informed by the advertising efforts of a financial services institution and, in turn, whether that advertising is influential.Using a survey based approach amongst UK citizens, we reveal that advertising has an impact on financial planning. For practitioners, this means that communications must be an integral part of ensuring citizens are making the best decisions for themselves. This, we argue, has important implications for citizens and policy. We advocate that financial education should start as early as possible so as to highlight the longer-term benefits of good financial planning. This approach could be based on strategies used to educate and increase financial engagement. Another of our survey\u2019s important contributions shows that good financial planning and decision-making lead to a greater level of financial ability. Financial ability leads to trust."

    "abstract": "Concern about the increasing use of payday lending led the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to introduce landmark reforms in 2014\/15. While these reforms have generally been welcomed as a way of curbing 'extortionate' and 'predatory' lending, this paper presents a more nuanced picture based on a theoretically-informed analysis of the growth and nature of payday lending combined with original and rigorous qualitative interviews with customers. We argue that payday lending has grown as a result of three major and inter-related trends: growing income insecurity for people both in and out of work; cuts in state welfare provision; and increasing financialisation. Recent reforms of payday lending do nothing to tackle these root causes. Our research also makes a major contribution to debates about the 'everyday life' of financialisation by focusing on the 'lived experience' of borrowers. We show that, contrary to the rather simplistic picture presented by the media and many campaigners, various aspects of payday lending are actually welcomed by customers, given the situations they are in. Tighter regulation may therefore have negative consequences for some. More generally, we argue that the regul(aris)ation of payday lending reinforces the shift in the role of the state from provider\/redistributor to regulator\/enabler."

Whilst there is a long history of credit rationing to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK, the financial crisis has seen banks retreat further from lending to viable SMEs due to a reassessment of risk and lack of available capital. In so doing, the credit crunch is thought to be creating new geographies of financial exclusion. This paper explores the financial inclusion of enterprise through community development finance institutions (CDFIs) which provide loan finance to firms at the commercial margins in the West Midlands, UK. The paper concludes that CDFIs could partially address the financial exclusion of enterprise as an additional, alternative source of finance to that of mainstream banks."

The paper concludes that there appears to be a groundswell of momentum behind making financial education a compulsory part of the National Curriculum, but, even if this happens, there will be challenges in delivering such education in practice. For example, the role of values in financial education makes it a contested subject and teachers will need training and support to deal with this. They will also need to be supported to deliver financial education in a way which recognises diversity and sensitivity issues in the classroom."

In particular, by combining research on gendered subjectivities in elite labour markets with Foucauldian-inspired cultural economy research on the processes of financial subjectification, we argue that business education played an important role in performing discourses of idealised investment banking subjects who embodied essentialised masculine qualities during the period of rapid financialized growth in the 2000s. We then examine the temporary fragility of these \u2018masters of the universe\u2019 by exploring how the power of investment banking subjects was momentarily destabilised as the global financial crisis was scripted in public discourse as being caused in part by the dominance of hyper-masculine investment bankers. By focusing on the relationship between educational practices and the gendered nature of financial services work, our analysis responds to calls to develop a more politically engaged cultural economy of finance by raising normative questions concerning the financial subjectivities that could, or should, be called forth within the post-crisis international financial system."

In response, in this paper we examine the growth of for-profit business education service firms that have grown to meet the increased demand for lifelong learning and education by focusing on the financial business education sector in London. We develop cultural economy approaches to market making in order to understand how these educational service firms have developed by \u2018stabilising\u2019 new educational services and products that compete with, and seek to \u2018destabilise\u2019, more established forms of business education, particularly MBA degrees.

    "abstract": "The financial exclusion of enterprise is a concept that has been largely neglected by economic geographers. This is surprising given the attention dedicated to personal financial exclusion and alternative sources of finance. This paper compares financial inclusion policies in deprived areas of the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) through the example of Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs). CDFIs help overcome financial exclusion by providing local sources of loan finance to micro, small-and-medium-sized enterprises and social enterprises. Drawing upon interviews with key actors within the CDFI sector in the US and UK respectively, the paper aims to compare the CDFI landscape across the US and UK through the provision of finance for enterprise. This is in order to understand the geographies of finance that are being created by such alternative financial institutions thereby contributing to financial inclusion debates. The research concludes that although CDFIs do provide an important source of finance to excluded enterprises, policy initiatives have created uneven geographical coverage and market gaps leaving marked spaces of financial exclusion."

Extant research has examined the long-standing relationship between educational background and entry into these financial labour markets. Far less attention has been paid to how the relationship between education and financial elites has changed more recently as financial labour markets have become increasingly transnational in nature and education and learning increasingly extend beyond higher education into the workplace. In response, this paper combines work on transnational elite labour markets with work from the sociology of education on the intersection between work and workplace education in order to understand the different strategies used by individuals (from both the UK and overseas) to acquire a range of credentials following their first degree in an effort to advance their careers within contemporary financial services labour markets. We argue that this research reveals the comparatively neglected trans-local qualities of workplace learning and education as individuals acquire both international and local academic credentials in what are often assumed to be global elite labour markets.

Whilst business education in general and MBA degrees in particular are often claimed to facilitate globally mobile economic elites, we argue that the assembling of financial expertise through business education also serves to territorially and societally embed financiers into particular regulatory regimes and organizational cultures. As a result, we suggest that business education represents an important, yet hitherto neglected, set of activities in understanding the continued geographical and organizational heterogeneity of elite financial labour markets. In so doing, we argue that a focus on financial business education demonstrates the value of cultural economy approaches to financial geography and research into the variegated nature of finance capitalism more generally."

    "abstract": "Advancements in additively manufactured (AM) carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) composites for structural applications require reliable tools to predict mechanical performance. Already, the composites are finding applications in wind turbines, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), space applications, etc., and are promising for more emerging needs. Fiber volume plays a huge role in influencing the mechanical performance of the composites. However, more understanding of their effects are still needed to better ascertain material performance, which can be achieved by applying simulation modeling. This study developed a micromechanical model from Python scripts for Abaqus command line within computer-aided engineering (CAE) environment to predict thecomposites\u2019 structural stability and mechanical performance. The verification of the finite element model by experimental testing showed both the simulation and experimental results to match within an acceptable range. Tensile modulus increased with fiber volume while compressive modulus shows some decreased properties with fiber addition irrespective of fiber content for up to 25% CF volume. The overall results show a possible trade-off between the tensile and compressive properties of the composite, which should be carefully considered in material design for various AM applications."

    "cu_author": "Deji Aremu",
    "date": "18 Apr 2023",
    "abstract": "The use of fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs) in sandwich structures increased for various industrial applications thanks to their strength-to-weight ratio which provides designers with advanced options for modern structures. FRP Sandwich Structures (FRPSS) are often used in aerospace, biomedical, defence, and marine products, where their high structural performance is required to sustain complex in-service loads and withstand varying environmental conditions. Progressive degradation of FRPSS under such circumstances has been a subject of interest for researchers owing to safety requirements for products with FRP. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of the mechanical behaviour of FRPSS subjected to various loading regimes. It highlights the variation in structural performance, viscoelastic properties, damage resistance, and sequence of environmental degradation of FRPSS. Numerical methods and damage algorithms used to predict failures are also presented to provide sufficient knowledge for the design of FRPSS. This review contributes to further research on characterizing the properties of FRPSS under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions"

    "cu_author": "Deji Aremu",
    "date": "Nov 2022",
    "abstract": "Materials design advancements are now paramount to further the course of additive manufacturing (AM) of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites. This is due to the increased prospect of such composites in a wide range of applications, ranging from space to automotive subjected to stringent mechanical performance requirements. A synergy of the high strength-to-weight ratio of the CFRP composites coupled with design freedoms inherent in AM techniques offers several interesting opportunities to customize and increase access to mechanical parts. However, several challenges are currently preventing the AM fabrication of the composites from realizing satisfactory mechanical properties compared to some of the traditional methods such as autoclave molding, extrusion molding, compression molding, etc. The challenges can be improved with a better understanding and appropriation of materials design factors that define the controllable material features which could be suitably varied to obtain desired mechanical performances. This paper reviews the literature on the material factors that influence the mechanical performance of parts composed of short-fiber CFRP composites fabricated through the AM technique. Thermoplastic matrix compositions, chain arrangements, and structural morphology effects are discussed in relation to the ease of processing and the final mechanical performance of fabricated composites. Operating environmental effects on mechanical performance were reviewed and also works of literature on the current state of development in the simulation modeling of material factors in the AM fabrication of CFRP composites were discussed."
