We aimed to compare Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy in patients with severe obesity.Methods: By-Band-Sleeve is a pragmatic, multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted in 12 hospitals in the UK. Eligible participants were adults (aged \u226518 years) meeting national criteria for metabolic and bariatric surgery. Initially, a 2-group trial (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus adjustable gastric banding) became a 3-group trial to include sleeve gastrectomy at 2\u00b76 years from study opening, when it became widely used in the UK. Co-primary endpoints were weight (proportion achieving \u226550% excess weight loss) and quality-of-life (EQ-5D utility score) at 3 years. If the proportion achieving at least 50% excess weight loss was non-inferior (<12% difference between groups) and quality-of-life was superior, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were considered more effective than adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy more effective than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Cost-effectiveness of the procedures was compared. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02841527, and ISRCTN, 00786323."

    "abstract": "Summary: Specialist weight management services including bariatric surgery are commissioned within regions of England called Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) with eligibility and treatment guidelines determined as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. Reported variation in commissioning and bariatric surgery eligibility criteria has not been previously mapped. Freedom of Information (FOI) requests provide a tool, supported by legislation, to ask questions of public authorities including ICSs such that they must respond accurately. FOIs were sent to all 42 ICSs in England asking 4 questions aiming to establish whether there is variation in the commissioning of specialist weight management services and the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery across England. Responses were presented descriptively and mapped across England. Responses were received from 41 out of 42 ICSs, with 34 reporting that they provide commissioned medical weight management programmes and 38 funding bariatric surgery. Thirteen reported using criteria that were not compliant with NICE guidance. A large area of the country centred around the East of England does not have a bariatric unit reducing access to care. There is significant geographical variation in the availability of both bariatric and specialist medical weight management services across England, with large portions of the country without local access to a service or no service at all. Where services are available, there is significant inconsistency in eligibility for bariatric surgery despite nationally available guidance."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To use vignettes to facilitate exploration of the internal dialogue and clinical reasoning processes of general practice healthcare professionals (GPHCPs) during interactions with patients living with obesity. Design: This study used an exploratory qualitative research design. Data were collected using semistructured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data analysed using Framework Method analysis. Five vignettes were presented to participants, showing a patient\u2019s photograph, name, age and body mass index. Participants were asked to describe their first impressions of each fictionalised patient. Setting: Interviews were conducted remotely via Skype between August and September 2019. Participants: A convenience sample of UK GPHCPs was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and 9 general practitioners). Results: Five themes were generated: visual assessment, assumed internal contributing factors, assumed external contributing factors, potential clinical contributing factors and potential clinical consequences. A pattern-recognition approach was identified, as GPHCPs\u2019 assumptions around patients\u2019 lifestyles, occupations and eating habits emerged as explanations for their weight, with a mixture of both objective and subjective comments. Conclusions: While it is part of the diagnostic skill of a clinician to be able to form a clinical picture based on the information available, it is important to be aware of the potential for assumptions made within this process to contribute to unconscious bias\/stereotyping. Healthcare professionals need to work to counteract the potential impact of internal bias on their consultations to provide fair and equitable care for people living with obesity, by exercising reflexivity within their clinical practice."

This study reports on the results of the second and third global multidisciplinary Standardizing Quality of life measures in Obesity Treatment (S.Q.O.T.) consensus meetings, where a core set of PROMs to measure nine previously selected patient\u2010reported outcomes (PROs) in obesity treatment research was established. The S.Q.O.T. II online and S.Q.O.T. III face\u2010to\u2010face hybrid consensus meetings were held in October 2021 and May 2022. The meetings were led by an independent moderator specializing in PRO measurement. Nominal group techniques, Delphi exercises, and anonymous voting were used to select the most suitable PROMs by consensus. The meetings were attended by 28 and 27 participants, respectively, including a geographically diverse selection of people living with obesity (PLWO) and experts from various disciplines.Out of 24 PROs and 16 PROMs identified in the first S.Q.O.T. consensus meeting, the following nine PROs and three PROMs were selected via consensus: BODY\u2010Q (physical function, physical symptoms, psychological function, social function, eating behavior, and body image), IWQOL\u2010Lite (self\u2010esteem), and QOLOS (excess skin). No PROM was selected to measure stigma as existing PROMs deemed to be inadequate. A core set of PROMs to measure QoL in research focused on obesity treatment has been selected incorporating patients' and experts' opinions. This core set should serve as a minimum to use in obesity research studies and can be combined with clinical parameters."

The objective of this study was to select a core set of patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures to be used in clinical obesity care. Materials and Methods: The Standardizing Quality of Life in Obesity Treatment III, face-to-face hybrid consensus meeting, including people living with obesity as well as healthcare providers, was held in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 2022. It was preceded by two prior multinational consensus meetings and a systematic review. Results: The meeting was attended by 27 participants, representing twelve countries from five continents. The participants included healthcare providers, such as surgeons, endocrinologists, dietitians, psychologists, researchers, and people living with obesity, most of whom were involved in patient representative networks. Three patient-reported outcome measures (patient-reported outcomes) were selected: the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (self-esteem) measure, the BODY-Q (physical function, physical symptoms, psychological function, social function, eating behavior, and body image), and the Quality of Life for Obesity Surgery questionnaire (excess skin). No patient-reported outcome measure was selected for stigma. Conclusion: A core set of patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures for measuring quality of life in clinical obesity care is established incorporating patients\u2019 and experts\u2019 opinions. This set should be used as a minimum for measuring quality of life in routine clinical practice. It is essential that individual patient-reported outcome measure scores are shared with people living with obesity in order to enhance patient engagement and shared decision-making.

However, the prevalence and impact of a healthy weight body mass index (BMI) at disease presentation is not known. This study aimed to evaluate the visual and headache outcomes stratified by the presenting BMI. This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study (IIH Life) based on a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology IIH service, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, United Kingdom, recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between 2012 and 2021. Those with a presenting BMI were included. The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR visual acuity, Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation (PMD), optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements, and headache outcomes of frequency, severity, and Headache Impact Test-6 score. Three hundred seventy-five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI. About 3.7% of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and 15.5% BMI\u2009<\u200930\u2009kg\/m2. The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity; however, OCT papilloedema measures were similar. The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss. There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity. The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity, with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity. No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes. Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients. BMI at presentation does not appear to influence long-term visual or headache outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of obesity is rising globally and effective strategies to treat obesity are needed. Intermittent fasting, a dietary intervention for weight management, has received growing interest from the general public, as well as healthcare professionals, as a form of lifestyle intervention. Methods: We executed a rapid review using PUBMED database to identify systematic reviews that examined the impact of intermittent fasting on metabolic indices, published between 2011 and 2022. Results: Intermittent fasting leads to weight loss of a similar magnitude to continuous energy restriction. Most of the evidence shows that intermittent fasting leads to greater fat loss as measured by fat mass (kg) or body fat percentage compared to an ad libitum diet, but fat loss attained during intermittent fasting is not significantly different to continuous energy restriction, although recent evidence shows intermittent fasting to be superior. There is mixed evidence for the impact of intermittent fasting on insulin resistance, fasting glucose and lipid profile. Some studies focused on populations of Muslim people, which showed that Ramadan fasting may lead to weight loss and improvement of metabolic parameters during fasting, although the effects are reversed when fasting is finished. Conclusions: Intermittent fasting is more effective than an ad libitum dietary intake, and equally or more effective as continuous energy restriction, for weight management. However, there is inconclusive evidence on whether intermittent fasting has a clinically beneficial effect on glucose and lipid metabolism."

PBH develops relatively late after surgery and often after discharge from post-surgical follow-up by bariatric teams, leading to variability in diagnosis and management in non-specialist centres.AimThe overall aim was to improve and standardise clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of PBH. The objectives were: (1) to undertake an up-to-date review of the current literature; (2) to formulate practical and evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH; (3) to recommend future avenues for research in this condition.MethodA scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search. A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders.OutcomeWe make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH, including criteria for diagnosis and recognition, as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored.Plain English summaryPost-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery. In this condition, people develop low blood sugar occurring about 2\u20134 h after meals, leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger, sweating, anxiety, palpitations and even blackouts and fainting. PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes. The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow-up after their surgery, which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non-specialist healthcare centres. The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care. To address this problem, the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition. The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians, surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss, and hormone specialists."

Design\/methodology\/approach: A systematic search of the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus and APA PsycINFO was conducted to identify relevant journal articles published up to August 2023. The quality of the included studies was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Tool. Data was synthesized and analysed using thematic synthesis. Findings: Four studies from the UK, USA and Canada were included in the meta-synthesis. Three main themes were found: gratifying others, negative childhood experiences and shame and stigma. Practical implications: South Asian women report many socio-cultural factors that can influence eating disorder development. Findings of this meta-synthesis highlight the importance of cultural awareness, and health-care professionals should be aware of the nuanced socio-cultural factors that can influence a South Asian woman\u2019s relationship with food and body image. Originality\/value: South Asian communities are understudied in the context of mental health, including eating disorders. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study to synthesize the available qualitative evidence on socio-cultural influences on eating disorder development among South Asian women. These findings have revealed insights that can be harnessed by health-care professionals to better understand factors that contribute to eating disorder development and support cultural awareness."

However, HCPs have concerns about addressing this issue. There is a need to understand the factors that influence HCPs in initiating these conversations to inform strategies to support them. AIM: To explore with HCPs, working in primary care and community settings, their experiences of having conversations about child weight with parents, and the factors that create barriers or facilitate them to have these conversations. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative study with GPs, primary care nurses (PNs), and school nurses (SNs) in England. METHOD: GPs and PNs were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. SNs from a community healthcare NHS trust were recruited to participate in focus groups. Vignettes were used to stimulate discussion. Data were analysed guided by the Framework approach. RESULTS: Thirteen GPs, seven PNs, and 20 SNs participated. The following three themes were identified regarding barriers to HCPs having conversations about child excess weight: structural and organisational; HCP related; and parent or family related. The themes identified for the factors that facilitate these conversations were: structural changes (for example, dedicated appointments, access to weight assessment data, joined-up working across agencies); HCP approaches (for example, providing appropriate dietary and physical activity advice); and HCP knowledge and skills (for example, enhancing HCPs' general and weight management-related skills and knowledge of child weight management services). CONCLUSION: A range of barriers exist to HCPs addressing child excess weight with parents in primary care and community settings. Actions to effect structural changes and support HCPs in developing relevant knowledge and skills are required to overcome these barriers."

However, to date, research exploring the influence of Islam on food selection has almost exclusively focused on fasting during Ramadan and has not explored the influences of Islam on everyday food choices among Muslim people.Aim: This qualitative study explored the influence of Islamic religiosity on everyday food choices among Muslim people.Methods: Thirty-two adult participants residing in the United Kingdom (n=\u200916 faith leaders andn=\u200916 lay Muslim people) were recruited from three Sunni mosques, and data was collected using semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis and a constant comparison method was applied to draw out similarities and differences between faith leaders and lay Muslim people.Results: The results revealed that Islamic religiosity had an influence over food choice with two main overarching themes 1) Demonstrating religious obedience through food choices and, 2) Spheres of influence on food choice; and five sub-themes 1a) Trusting in familiar food providers, 1b) Verification of halal authenticity, 1c) Seeking purity within food, 2a) The Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) as a role model for food choice and, 2b) Islamic jurisprudence.Conclusion: These findings provide important insights into the influence of Islam on food choice and could be used support the design of faith-informed dietary interventions among Muslim people.

    "abstract": "The health benefits of bariatric surgery are well documented; however, the occurrence of weight-regain after surgery, along with the development of mental health difficulties poses a question of how contemporary psychology could assist to prepare people living with obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. This research explored individuals' (in the immediate pre-operative and post-operative population) attitudes, beliefs and experiences towards obesity and their journey to bariatric surgery. Seventeen adult participants (males n\u2009=\u20094; age range: 26\u201364\u2009years) were recruited and participated in a semi-structured interview. Twelve individuals participated prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. Five individuals participated in the early post-operative period (<3\u2009months post-surgery). People living with obesity displayed high optimism for positive outcomes, with participants hoping that bariatric surgery would be different to previous attempts at weight regulation, with there being a clear shift in the locus of control for weight management from self to healthcare professionals. Whilst this is adaptive, there was the presence of seemingly unrealistic optimism, with many pre-surgery participants not relaying the realistic possibility of post-surgery weight-regain. Despite the optimism individuals feel about bariatric surgery, participants felt that the psychological factors influencing eating behaviours are not being addressed by healthcare. These findings suggest that mindfulness, mindful eating, and self-compassion approaches should be incorporated into clinical practice to support weight regulation and adaption to physiological changes after bariatric surgery."

It is not clear whether EE presents to an equal degree among adults, regardless of their body mass index (BMI) status. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in degree of EE between adults with healthy weight, overweight and obesity. Methods: MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO databases were searched from inception up to January 2022 for studies that reported EE scores from validated questionnaires. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the AXIS tool. Meta\u2010analysis used random effects and standardised mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was investigated usingI2statistics and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 11 studies with 7207 participants were included in the meta\u2010analysis. Degree of EE was greater in adults with a BMI above the healthy range, compared to adults with a healthy BMI (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to0.45;I2= 85%). However, subgroup analysis found that degree of EE was greater only in adults with obesity (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.81;I2= 62%),and there was no difference in degree of EE between adults with overweight and those with a healthy BMI. Conclusions: Degree of EE is greater among adults living with obesity, compared to adults with a healthy BMI, indicating a need for behavioural support to support EE among people living with obesity seeking weight management.

Reducing focus on weight is a proposed strategy to provide less threatening healthcare experiences. Given the lack of research on weight bias within obesity services, this study aimed to explore implicit bias among obesity specialist HCPs and explore views on non-weight focused approaches.METHODS: Obesity specialist HCPs were invited to a webinar, \"An exploration of non-weight focused approaches within bariatric services\", held in October 2021. Implicit weight bias was examined using the BiasProof mobile device test, based on the Implicit Association Test. Poll data was analysed descriptively, and qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis.FINDINGS: 82 of the 113 HCPs who attended the webinar consented to contribute data to the study. Over half (51%) had an implicit weight bias against PLwO. Most (90%) agreed\/strongly agreed that obesity services are too weight focused and that patients should not be weighed at every appointment (86%). Perceived benefits of taking a non-weight focused approach included patient-led care, reducing stigma and supporting patient wellbeing, while perceived barriers included loss of objectivity, inducing risk and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness.INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that half of obesity specialists HCPs in our sample of 82 providers, who are primarily dieticians and psychologists, have an implicit weight bias against PLwO. HCPs feel that a weight-focused approach within services was a barrier to patient care, but that there is a lack of alternative non-weight focused measures. Further research is needed into substitute outcome measures for clinical practice, also seeking the views of PLwO, and into interventions to address implicit weight bias.FUNDING: Johnson & Johnson funded the BiasProof licence and publication open access charge."

Participants were randomly assigned to bypass or band initially and to sleeve after the adaptation. Co-primary end points are weight loss and health-related quality of life assessed using the EQ-5D utility index.Results: Between December 2012 and August 2015, the study recruited into two groups and, after the adaptation, into three groups until September 2019. The study screened 6960 patients; 4732 (68%) were eligible and 1351 (29%) were randomized; 5 subsequently withdrew consent to use data, leaving 462, 464, and 420 assigned to bypass, band, and sleeve, respectively. Baseline data showed high levels of obesity (mean BMI\u00a0=\u00a046.4\u00a0kg\/m2; SD: 6.9) and comorbidities (e.g., 31% diabetes), low scores for health-related quality of life, and high levels of anxiety and depression (e.g., 25% abnormal scores). Nutritional parameters were poor, and the average equivalized household income was low (\u00a316,667).Conclusions: By-Band-Sleeve fully recruited. Participant characteristics are consistent with contemporary patients having bariatric surgery, and therefore the results will be generalizable."

We sought to conduct the first cost-effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with class II obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9\u2009kg\/m ) from a national healthcare system perspective in England based on results from this study. A 6-state Markov model was developed comprising 5 BMI-based health states and an absorbing death state. Baseline characteristics, utilities, and transition probabilities were informed by patient-level data from the subset of patients with class II obesity in MERIT. Adverse events (AEs) were based on the MERIT safety population. Mortality was estimated by applying BMI-specific hazard ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates. Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from the literature; disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I-III obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data. Disutility due to AEs and the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities were based on the literature. Costs included intervention costs, AE costs, and comorbidity costs. ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESG vs LM alone was \u00a32453\/QALY gained. ESG was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses, with no ICER estimate exceeding \u00a310,000\/QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was \u00a32502\/QALY gained and ESG remained cost effective in 98.25% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320,000\/QALY. Our study indicates that ESG is highly cost effective versus LM alone for the treatment of adults with class II obesity in England."

Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine factors predictive of 5% weight loss.\n \n Results\n Most centers (n = 9) prescribed an 800- to 1000-kcal diet, but the duration and formulation of diet was variable. Overall, 30.6% (n = 510) of patients achieved 5% weight loss during the LRD. After adjustment for preoperative weight, women had reduced odds (odds ratio [OR], .65; 95% confidence interval [CI], .48\u2013.88; P = .005), while increasing age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.02; P = .043) and having type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.16\u20131.92; P = .002) increased odds of 5% weight loss.

    "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic condition severely impacting the quality of life of people living with IIH (PwIIH). Most PwIIH are overweight or live with obesity, and weight loss is recommended by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as it is central to disease management. There is currently no research evaluating patient-clinician interactions when discussing weight management in IIH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of communication with HCPs regarding weight management from the perspective of PwIIH.Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was developed and distributed by the IIH UK charity via their mailing list and social media network. Eligible participants were adults with IIH who have been recommended to lose weight by their HCP. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative responses and content analysis was used to inductively draw out themes from open-ended free-text responses.Results: There were 625 respondents. One fifth of PwIIH (n=127\/603, 21%) felt that HCPs were supportive and empathetic about weight management. Five themes were identified on how experiences regarding weight management for IIH can be improved, with PwIIH recommending for HCPs to: (1) detail the relationship between IIH and weight, (2) individualise care, (3) give advice, (4) provide support, and (5) adapt communication.Conclusion: The majority of PwIIH recalled a poor experience and negative emotions when engaged in discussions regarding weight management with their HCPs. Further research should explore the HCPs perspective and evaluate interventions aiming to improve the quality of patient-HCPs communication in IIH."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with obesity, however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss, reduction in intracranial pressure, benefit to visual and headache outcomes, quality of life, and mental health.Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023339569). MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant literature published from inception until 15th December 2022. Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers. Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology.Results A total of 17 studies were included. Bariatric surgery resulted in 27.2-27.8kg weight loss at 24 months (Level 1- to 1++). Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between 1.4 to 15.7kg weight loss (Level 2+ to 1++). Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP (-11.9cm H2O) at 24 months (Level 1++), followed by multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide (-11.2cm H2O) at 6 months (Level 1+), and then a very low energy diet intervention (-8.0cm H2O) at 3 months (Level 2++). The least ICP reduction was shown at 24 months after completing a 12-month multi-component lifestyle intervention (-3.5 cm H2O) (Level 1++). Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP (Level 2++ to 1++).Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI \u226535kg\/m2 since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management (Grade A). A multi-component lifestyle intervention (diet + physical activity + behaviour) had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI <35kg\/m2 (Grade B). Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required, to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH."

    "abstract": "Background: Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) is a popular weight loss intervention worldwide, yet few scientific studies have examined variations in preoperative practices globally. This study aimed to capture global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients planned for BMS. Methods: A 41-item questionnaire-based survey was designed and the survey link was freely distributed on social and scientific media platforms, email groups and circulated through personal connections of authors. The survey included eight parts: basic information; criteria for BMS; preoperative nutritional screening; preoperative weight loss; preoperative diets for liver size reduction; preoperative glycemic control; other laboratory investigations and preparations; decision making, education, and consents. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data and graphs were used for representation where applicable. Results: Six hundred thirty-four bariatric healthcare professionals from 76 countries\/regions completed the survey. Of these, n = 310 (48.9%) were from public hospitals, n = 466 (73.5%) were surgeons, and the rest were multidisciplinary professionals. More than half of respondents reported using local society\/association guidelines in their practice (n = 310, 61.6%). The great majority of respondents routinely recommend nutritional screening preoperatively (n = 385, 77.5%), mandatory preoperative diets for liver size reduction (n = 220, 53.1%), routine screening for T2DM (n = 371, 90.7%), and mandate a glycemic control target before BMS in patients with T2DM (n = 203, 55.6%). However, less than half (n = 183, 43.9%) recommend mandatory preoperative weight loss to all patients. Most respondents (n = 296, 77.1%) recommend psychological intervention before surgery for patients diagnosed with psychological conditions. Variations were also identified in laboratory investigations and optimisation; and in the aspects of decision making, education and consent. Conclusions: This survey identified significant global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients seeking primary BMS. Our findings could facilitate future research for the determination of best practice in these areas of variations, and consensus-building to guide clinical practice while we wait for that evidence to emerge."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity, yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy. Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy, recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated. Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive; prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician. Ideally, patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy, through optimising their weight. Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy, excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications; evidence-based recommendations for non-IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain. The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery, with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed, provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission.

    "abstract": "Background:Low energy diets (LEDs)(1000-1200kcal) and very low energy diets (VLEDs) (<800kcal) have been shown to significantly reduce liver size in preparation for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. However, pre-operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre-operative diets within clinical practice. Thus, our study aimed to establish the variation in, and efficacy of, pre-operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at 16 participating UK bariatric centres between 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Patient demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity), diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected. We also collected data about the pre-operative diet regimes, including kcals\/day and duration. A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery. Baseline weight, diabetes status, diet duration and kcals\/day were included in the model.Results:A total of 2,092 patients were included in the analysis. Diets ranged from <800kcal to >1200kcals\/day and lasted one week to \u22655 weeks. The most common diets followed by patients were 800-1000kcals (55.7%) and lasted 2 weeks (71.4%). The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was 5.43kg (95% CI 5.18 to 5.68). Weight on the day of surgery was, on average, 0.79kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (p=0.002), and also less for 4 week (1.90kg, p=0.035) and \u22655 week diets (3.54kg, p=0.001), compared to a 1 week diet. Patients on a <800kcals\/day diet were, on average, 8.86kg lighter than >1200 Kcals\/day diets on the day of surgery (p=0.016). There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of <800kcal\/day diets and LEDs of either 800-1000kcal\/day (p=0.194) or 1000-1200kcal\/day (p=0.212).Conclusions:A range of pre-operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK, reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area. Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre-operative diets were associated with greater pre-operative weight loss. Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre-operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Background: Multi-component lifestyle interventions are the first line treatment for obesity. Dietitians are ideally placed healthcare professionals to deliver such interventions. However, only a small proportion of patients with obesity are referred by general practice to dietitians, and the reasons for this are not clear. The present study aimed to explore general practice healthcare professionals\u2019 (GPHCPs) experiences and perceptions of dietitians in the context of obesity management. Methods: A convenience sample of GPHCPs practicing in the UK was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using framework analysis. Results: In total, 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and nine general practitioners). Experiences of referring patients with obesity for dietetic intervention resulted in two main themes: (i) access barriers and (ii) the dietetic consult experience. Three themes emerged from participants\u2019 perceptions of a role for general practice dietitians: (i) utilising dietetic expertise; (ii) access to dietitian; and (iii) time. Participants experienced barriers to accessing dietitians for obesity management and felt that having a dietitian working within their general practice team would help address this. Having a dietitian embedded within their general practice team was perceived to have the potential to alleviate GPHCPs\u2019 clinical time pressures, offer opportunities for upskilling, and may improve patient engagement with obesity management. Conclusions: GPHCPs perceived that embedding a dietitian within their general practice team would be valuable and beneficial for obesity management. Our findings provide support for the funding of general practice dietitian roles in the UK."

However, it is not clear whether delivery in a group or one-to-one format influences weight loss efficacy. The present study aimed to systematically review the evidence of the effectiveness of group compared to one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight management.METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and ISRCTN databases were searched from inception up to February 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing group versus one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with a body mass index \u2265 25 kg m-2 . The primary outcome was weight loss (kg) at 12 months and the secondary outcome was attainment of \u22655% weight loss at 12 months. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis used random effects and estimated risk ratios and continuous inverse variance methods. Heterogeneity was investigated using I2 statistics and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials with 2576 participants were included. Group interventions were favoured over one-to-one interventions for weight loss at 12 months (-1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval = -1.3 to -2.6; I2 = 99%). Participants of group interventions were more likely to attain \u22655% weight loss at 12 months relative to one-to-one interventions (relative risk = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.00; I2 = 60%).CONCLUSIONS: Group multi-component lifestyle interventions are superior for weight loss compared to one-to-one interventions with respect to adult weight management. Further research is required to determine whether specific components of group interventions can explain the superiority of weight loss outcomes in group interventions."

Aim To investigate whether nutritional and weight monitoring in primary care meets current clinical guidance, after patients are discharged from specialist bariatric care. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study in primary care practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data in the UK (1 January 2000 to 17 January 2018). Method Participants were adults who had had bariatric surgery with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 follow-up post-surgery, as this study focused on patients discharged from specialist care (at 2 years post-surgery). Outcomes were the annual proportion of patients from 2 years post-surgery with a record of recommended nutritional screening blood tests, weight measurement, and prescription of nutritional supplements, and the proportions with nutritional deficiencies based on blood tests. Results A total of 3137 participants were included in the study, and median follow-up post-surgery was 5.7 (4.2\u20137.6) years. Between 45% and 59% of these patients had an annual weight measurement. The greatest proportions of patients with a record of annual nutritional blood tests were for tests routinely conducted in primary care, for example, recorded haemoglobin measurement varied between 44.9% (n = 629\/1400) and 61.2% (n = 653\/1067). Annual proportions of blood tests specific to bariatric surgery were low, for example, recorded copper measurement varied between 1.2% (n = 10\/818) and 1.5% (n = 16\/1067) where recommended. Results indicated that the most common deficiency was anaemia. Annual proportions of patients with prescriptions for recommended nutritional supplements were low. Conclusion This study suggests that patients who have bariatric surgery are not receiving the recommended nutritional monitoring after discharge from specialist care. GPs and patients should be supported to engage with follow-up care. Future research should aim to understand the reasons underpinning these findings."

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. Methods: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept\/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. Results: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a0227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. Conclusion: Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes."

This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges.                              Recent Findings                Evidence for tier 2 (community-based lifestyle intervention) and tier 3 (specialist weight management services) is limited, and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier 4 remains uncertain. Treatment access, rigidity in pathways, uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care.                              Summary                More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments, treatment flexibility, addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcomes. Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways. A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care for those who need it."

    "abstract": "Background: Many bariatric surgical centers mandate achieving weight loss targets through medical weight management (MWM) programs before offering bariatric surgery, but the evidence for this is unclear. Objectives: To examine the relationship between weight changes during (1) MWM, and (2) preoperative low-energy-diet (LED), and weight changes at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Setting: Multicenter community- and acute-based MWM services referring to one regional bariatric center, United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients who attended MWM and then underwent a primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure (adjustable gastric banding [LAGB], or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) in a single bariatric center in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015. Data were collected from patient electronic records. Results: Two hundred eight patients were included (LAGB n = 128, RYGB n = 80). Anthropometric data were available for 94.7% and 88.0% of participants at 12 and 24 months, respectively. There was no relationship between weight loss during MWM and after surgery at either 12 or 24 months. Weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB (\u03b2 = .251, P = .006) and less weight loss after RYGB (\u03b2 = \u2212.390, P = .003) at 24 months, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline weight, and LED duration. Conclusions: Weight loss in MWM does not predict greater weight loss outcomes up to 24 months after LAGB or RYGB. Greater weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB and less weight loss after RYGB. Our results suggest that patients should not be denied bariatric surgery because of not achieving weight loss in MWM. Weight loss responses to preoperative LEDs as a predictor of postsurgical weight loss requires further investigation."

Survival was compared between cases and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and the log rank test up to 5-years post-operatively.Results: The mean age (S.D.) for cases (n=41) and controls (n=82) were 67 (2.3) and 46 years (5.1), respectively. Mean BMI was 47 kg\/m2 (7.2), 34% were men and 59% had Type 2 diabetes. There was 0% mortality in both cases and controls at 30-days post-operative. Over 5-years post-operative follow-up; there was 9.8% (n=4) mortality in older adults (9.8%) 1.2% mortality (n=1) in controls (P=0.03). No deaths were due to surgical complication. At 5-years post-operative, BMI reduction in older adults (7.2\u00b16.1 kg\/m2) was significantly less than younger controls (11.6\u00b18.6 kg\/m2) (t(72)=\u22122.218, P=0.030). Meanwhile there was no significant difference in change in HbA1c among patients with Type 2 Diabetes (P=0.516).Conclusion: In older adults, BS was not associated with increased 30-day mortality or surgical-related mortality up to 5 years post-surgery. BS resulted in clinically meaningful BMI reductions in older patients at 5 years post-surgery. However, BMI reductions were significantly greater in younger patients at 5 years post-surgery. The impact of surgery on glycaemic control was similar across older and younger adults with Type 2 diabetes. BS is a valid option of treatment in older patients with obesity, future studies need to examine the impact of surgery on functionality and quality of life in this patient group."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are more likely to have obesity. However, it is not clear whether social deprivation has an impact on accessing and the outcomes of bariatric surgery. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of indices of deprivation on access to bariatric surgery and its outcomes.Methods: Cross-sectional prospective evaluation in a single centre in England of all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery in 2016. Deprivation was assessed using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) (2015), which ranks areas within England from the most (IMD Decile=1) to least deprived (IMD Decile=10). We extracted lower-layer super output area IMD Deciles according to the patients post code at time of bariatric surgery as well as the 12-month post-surgical weight loss and type of surgery.Results: Of the 183 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, 55% (n=102) lived in areas within the 1-3rd IMD Decile (most deprived areas) (27% (4-6th) and 17% (7-10th) IMD Decile). There was no relationship between the type of bariatric surgery offered and IMD Decile. There was no relationship between IMD Decile tertiles (1-3,4-7, 7-10) and % weight loss at one year either across all bariatric surgical interventions (r2=0.019, P=0.09; r2=0.012, P=0.17) or when analysed according to surgery type.Conclusions: People undergoing bariatric surgery typically lived in more deprived areas which might be anticipated by the correlation between deprivation and obesity as well as the relative levels of deprivation within our catchment area suggesting by this measure that deprivation is not a clear barrier to accessing bariatric surgery, however data was not available on patients who did not undergo surgery and this may reveal potential inequalities with accessing bariatric surgery both at the point of referral from primary care as well as in the transition from Tier 3 to Tier 4 services. Deprivation does not seem to have an effect on weight loss at 1 year post bariatric surgery. This data suggests that the bariatric surgery service is accessible to people across all IMD Deciles within our catchment area.Keywords: Obesity, social deprivation, healthcare inequa"

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, and is closely linked to obesity. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are eating disorders that are common in obesity, and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T2DM.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria; including patients >\u200918 years old, with T2DM, and BED and\/or NES. The reference lists of included studies were also searched. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest.ResultsA total of 10 studies (2 included NES) were included in this systematic review. The number screened for BED and NES were 6527 and 1039 participants, respectively. Point prevalence was 1.2\u20138.0% for BED and 3.8\u20138.4% for NES. Patients with T2DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T2DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA1c.ConclusionsBED and NES are common in adults with T2DM, and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T2DM. However, only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA1c in patients with T2DM. Hence, further well-designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T2DM. Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T2DM."

A total of 45 patients (64.4% women, median [interquartile range] age 49 [45-60] years) were included. The median (interquartile range) weight loss from start of MWM until 12\u2009months post-surgery was 17.9% (13.0%-29.3%). GLP-1RA treatment during MWM resulted in 5.0% (1.9%-7.7%) weight loss. Weight loss during GLP-1RA treatment predicted weight loss from the start of MWM until 12\u2009months post-surgery, but not postoperative weight loss after adjustment. The proportion of weight loss from start of MWM to 12\u2009months post-surgery attributed to GLP-1RA treatment was negatively associated with that attributed to surgery, after adjustment. In conclusion, weight change after GLP-1RA treatment predicted the weight loss achieved by a combination of MWM and bariatric surgery, but not weight loss induced by surgery only. Failure to lose weight after GLP-1RA treatment should not be considered a barrier to undergoing bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Utilising multiple disjoint paths in multiple channels can improve network performance by enabling a node to reroute data along discovered paths seamlessly when link failure is detected. However, depending on a stale\/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover fromthe broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting\/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network."

    "date": "4 May 2017",
    "abstract": "Utilising multiple channels can increase the wireless ad hoc network capacity. Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol."

    "abstract": "The route recovery algorithm is a crucial part of an ad hoc routing protocol. Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network."

    "abstract": "MANET routing protocols are designed based on the assumption that all nodes cooperate without maliciously disrupting the operation of the routing protocol. AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of network performance in the presence of blackhole attack. The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication. Using NS2 simulation, we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV, showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack."

In this paper, we study the performance of both DSR and its flow-state extension routing protocols in the presence of blackhole, grayhole, selfish and flooding attacks. We conclude that the performance of flow-state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks. Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics. Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR. All the attacks greatly increase the end-to-end delay; an effect particularly marked in a static network."
