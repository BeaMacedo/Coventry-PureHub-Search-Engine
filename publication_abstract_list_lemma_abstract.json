Recent Findings Evidence tier 2 ( community-based lifestyle intervention ) tier 3 ( specialist weight management service ) limited , facilitates care improve outcome tier 4 remains uncertain . Treatment access , rigidity pathway , uncertain treatment outcome weight stigma seems major barrier improved care . Summary emphasis must placed access effective treatment , treatment flexibility , addressing stigma ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcome . Prevention treatment receive significant focus though considered largely separate pathway . simplified system weight management needed allow flexibility delivery personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care need . ","Background : Many bariatric surgical center mandate achieving weight loss target medical weight management ( MWM ) program offering bariatric surgery , evidence unclear . Objectives : examine relationship weight change ( 1 ) MWM , ( 2 ) preoperative low-energy-diet ( LED ) , weight change 12 24 month surgery . Setting : Multicenter community- acute-based MWM service referring one regional bariatric center , United Kingdom . Methods : retrospective cohort study patient attended MWM underwent primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure ( adjustable gastric banding [ LAGB ] , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [ RYGB ] ) single bariatric center United Kingdom 2013 2015 . Data collected patient electronic record . Results : Two hundred eight patient included ( LAGB n = 128 , RYGB n = 80 ) . Anthropometric data available 94.7 % 88.0 % participant 12 24 month , respectively . relationship weight loss MWM surgery either 12 24 month . Weight loss preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss LAGB ( \u03b2 = .251 , P = .006 ) less weight loss RYGB ( \u03b2 = \u2212.390 , P = .003 ) 24 month , adjusting age , sex , ethnicity , baseline weight , LED duration . Conclusions : Weight loss MWM predict greater weight loss outcome 24 month LAGB RYGB . Greater weight loss preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss LAGB less weight loss RYGB . result suggest patient denied bariatric surgery achieving weight loss MWM . Weight loss response preoperative LEDs predictor postsurgical weight loss requires investigation . ","","Introduction : Obesity common ( prevalence 30 % ) older adult ( \u226565 year ) .
