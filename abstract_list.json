uncertain which operation is most effective or cost effective  We aimed to compare Roux en Y gastric bypass  adjustable gastric banding  and sleeve gastrectomy in patients with severe obesity Methods  By Band Sleeve is a pragmatic  multi centre  open label  randomised controlled trial conducted in    hospitals in the UK  Eligible participants were adults  aged \u2265   years  meeting national criteria for metabolic and bariatric surgery  Initially  a   group trial  Roux en Y gastric bypass versus adjustable gastric banding  became a   group trial to include sleeve gastrectomy at  \u00b7  years from study opening  when it became widely used in the UK  Co primary endpoints were weight  proportion achieving \u2265    excess weight loss  and quality of life  EQ  D utility score  at   years  If the proportion achieving at least     excess weight loss was non inferior       difference between groups  and quality of life was superior  sleeve gastrectomy and Roux en Y gastric bypass were considered more effective than adjustable gastric banding  and sleeve gastrectomy more effective than Roux en Y gastric bypass  Cost effectiveness of the procedures was compared  This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials gov  NCT          and ISRCTN           ","Summary  Specialist weight management services including bariatric surgery are commissioned within regions of England called Integrated Care Systems  ICSs  with eligibility and treatment guidelines determined as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  NICE  guidance  Reported variation in commissioning and bariatric surgery eligibility criteria has not been previously mapped  Freedom of Information  FOI  requests provide a tool  supported by legislation  to ask questions of public authorities including ICSs such that they must respond accurately  FOIs were sent to all    ICSs in England asking   questions aiming to establish whether there is variation in the commissioning of specialist weight management services and the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery across England  Responses were presented descriptively and mapped across England  Responses were received from    out of    ICSs  with    reporting that they provide commissioned medical weight management programmes and    funding bariatric surgery  Thirteen reported using criteria that were not compliant with NICE guidance  A large area of the country centred around the East of England does not have a bariatric unit reducing access to care  There is significant geographical variation in the availability of both bariatric and specialist medical weight management services across England  with large portions of the country without local access to a service or no service at all  Where services are available  there is significant inconsistency in eligibility for bariatric surgery despite nationally available guidance ","Objectives  To use vignettes to facilitate exploration of the internal dialogue and clinical reasoning processes of general practice healthcare professionals  GPHCPs  during interactions with patients living with obesity  Design  This study used an exploratory qualitative research design  Data were collected using semistructured interviews  Interviews were transcribed verbatim  and data analysed using Framework Method analysis  Five vignettes were presented to participants  showing a patient s photograph  name  age and body mass index  Participants were asked to describe their first impressions of each fictionalised patient  Setting  Interviews were conducted remotely via Skype between August and September       Participants  A convenience sample of UK GPHCPs was recruited via a targeted social media strategy  using virtual snowball sampling     participants were interviewed     general practice nurses and   general practitioners   Results  Five themes were generated  visual assessment  assumed internal contributing factors  assumed external contributing factors  potential clinical contributing factors and potential clinical consequences  A pattern recognition approach was identified  as GPHCPs  assumptions around patients  lifestyles  occupations and eating habits emerged as explanations for their weight  with a mixture of both objective and subjective comments  Conclusions  While it is part of the diagnostic skill of a clinician to be able to form a clinical picture based on the information available  it is important to be aware of the potential for assumptions made within this process to contribute to unconscious bias stereotyping  Healthcare professionals need to work to counteract the potential impact of internal bias on their consultations to provide fair and equitable care for people living with obesity  by exercising reflexivity within their clinical practice ","The lack of standardization in patient\u2010reported outcome measures  PROMs  has made measurement and comparison of quality of life  QoL  outcomes in research focused on obesity treatment challenging  This study reports on the results of the second and third global multidisciplinary Standardizing Quality of life measures in Obesity Treatment  S Q O T   consensus meetings  where a core set of PROMs to measure nine previously selected patient\u2010reported outcomes  PROs  in obesity treatment research was established  The S Q O T  II online and S Q O T  III face\u2010to\u2010face hybrid consensus meetings were held in October      and May       The meetings were led by an independent moderator specializing in PRO measurement  Nominal group techniques  Delphi exercises  and anonymous voting were used to select the most suitable PROMs by consensus  The meetings were attended by    and    participants  respectively  including a geographically diverse selection of people living with obesity  PLWO  and experts from various disciplines Out of    PROs and    PROMs identified in the first S Q O T  consensus meeting  the following nine PROs and three PROMs were selected via consensus  BODY\u2010Q  physical function  physical symptoms  psychological function  social function  eating behavior  and body image   IWQOL\u2010Lite  self\u2010esteem   and QOLOS  excess skin   No PROM was selected to measure stigma as existing PROMs deemed to be inadequate  A core set of PROMs to measure QoL in research focused on obesity treatment has been selected incorporating patients  and experts  opinions  This core set should serve as a minimum to use in obesity research studies and can be combined with clinical parameters ","Purpose  The focus of measuring success in obesity treatment is shifting from weight loss to patients  health and quality of life  The objective of this study was to select a core set of patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures to be used in clinical obesity care  Materials and Methods  The Standardizing Quality of Life in Obesity Treatment III  face to face hybrid consensus meeting  including people living with obesity as well as healthcare providers  was held in Maastricht  the Netherlands  in       It was preceded by two prior multinational consensus meetings and a systematic review  Results  The meeting was attended by    participants  representing twelve countries from five continents  The participants included healthcare providers  such as surgeons  endocrinologists  dietitians  psychologists  researchers  and people living with obesity  most of whom were involved in patient representative networks  Three patient reported outcome measures

patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures for measuring quality of life in clinical obesity care is established incorporating patients  and experts  opinions  This set should be used as a minimum for measuring quality of life in routine clinical practice  It is essential that individual patient reported outcome measure scores are shared with people living with obesity in order to enhance patient engagement and shared decision making  Graphical Abstract   Figure presented  ","Four authors who made significant contributions to the research project were inadvertently

predominantly affects reproductive aged females with obesity  However  the prevalence and impact of a healthy weight body mass index  BMI  at disease presentation is not known  This study aimed to evaluate the visual and headache outcomes stratified by the presenting BMI  This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study  IIH Life  based on a tertiary neuro ophthalmology IIH service  University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust  United Kingdom  recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between      and       Those with a presenting BMI were included  The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR visual acuity  Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation  PMD   optical coherence tomography  OCT  measurements  and headache outcomes of frequency  severity  and Headache Impact Test   score  Three hundred seventy five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI  About      of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and       BMI\u2009 \u2009  \u2009kg m   The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity  however  OCT papilloedema measures were similar  The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss  There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity  The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity  with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity  No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes  Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients  BMI at presentation does not appear to influence long term visual or headache outcomes ","Background  The prevalence of obesity is rising globally and effective strategies to treat obesity are needed  Intermittent fasting  a dietary intervention for weight management  has received growing interest from the general public  as well as healthcare professionals  as a form of lifestyle intervention  Methods  We executed a rapid review using PUBMED database to identify systematic reviews that examined the impact of intermittent fasting on metabolic indices  published between      and       Results  Intermittent fasting leads to weight loss of a similar magnitude to continuous energy restriction  Most of the evidence shows that intermittent fasting leads to greater fat loss as measured by fat mass  kg  or body fat percentage compared to an ad libitum diet  but fat loss attained during intermittent fasting is not significantly different to continuous energy restriction  although recent evidence shows intermittent fasting to be superior  There is mixed evidence for the impact of intermittent fasting on insulin resistance  fasting glucose and lipid profile  Some studies focused on populations of Muslim people  which showed that Ramadan fasting may lead to weight loss and improvement of metabolic parameters during fasting  although the effects are reversed when fasting is finished  Conclusions  Intermittent fasting is more effective than an ad libitum dietary intake  and equally or more effective as continuous energy restriction  for weight management  However  there is inconclusive evidence on whether intermittent fasting has a clinically beneficial effect on glucose and lipid metabolism ","Post bariatric hypoglycaemia  PBH  is typically a post prandial hypoglycaemia occurring about  \u2013  h after eating in individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery  PBH develops relatively late after surgery and often after discharge from post surgical follow up by bariatric teams  leading to variability in diagnosis and management in non specialist centres AimThe overall aim was to improve and standardise clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of PBH  The objectives were      to undertake an up to date review of the current literature      to formulate practical and evidence based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH      to recommend future avenues for research in this condition MethodA scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search  A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders OutcomeWe make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH  including criteria for diagnosis and recognition  as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored Plain English summaryPost bariatric hypoglycaemia  PBH  is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery  In this condition  people develop low blood sugar occurring about  \u2013  h after meals  leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger  sweating  anxiety  palpitations and even blackouts and fainting  PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes  The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow up after their surgery  which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non specialist healthcare centres  The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care  To address this problem  the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition  The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians  surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss  and hormone specialists ","Purpose  The purpose of this study is to synthesize published empirical qualitative evidence which explores the socio cultural influences on the development of eating disorders from the perspective of South Asian women  Design methodology approach  A systematic search of the databases CINAHL  MEDLINE  Scopus and APA PsycINFO was conducted to identify relevant journal articles published up to August       The quality of the included studies was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Tool  Data was synthesized and analysed using thematic synthesis  Findings  Four studies from the UK  USA and Canada were included in the meta synthesis  Three main themes were found  gratifying others  negative childhood experiences and shame and stigma  Practical implications  South Asian women report many socio cultural factors that can influence eating disorder development  Findings of this meta synthesis highlight the importance of cultural awareness  and health care professionals should be aware of the nuanced socio cultural factors that can influence a South Asian woman s relationship with food and body image  Originality value  South Asian communities are understudied in the context of mental health  including eating disorders  To the best of the authors  knowledge  this is the first study to synthesize the available qualitative evidence on socio cultural influences on eating disorder development among South Asian women  These findings have revealed insights that can be harnessed by health care professionals to better understand factors that contribute to eating disorder development and support cultural awareness ","BACKGROUND  Primary care and community healthcare professionals  HCPs  are well placed to discuss child excess weight with parents and support them to make changes  However  HCPs have concerns about addressing this issue  There is a need to understand the factors that influence HCPs in initiating these conversations to inform strategies to support them  AIM  To explore with HCPs  working in primary care and community settings  their experiences of having conversations about child weight with parents  and the factors that create barriers or facilitate them to have these conversations  DESIGN AND SETTING  A qualitative study with GPs  primary care nurses  PNs   and school nurses  SNs  in England  METHOD  GPs and PNs were recruited to participate in semi structured interviews  SNs from a community healthcare NHS trust were recruited to participate in focus groups  Vignettes were used to stimulate discussion  Data were analysed guided by the Framework approach  RESULTS  Thirteen GPs  seven PNs  and    SNs participated  The following three themes were identified regarding barriers to HCPs having conversations about child excess weight  structural and organisational  HCP related  and parent or family related  The themes identified for the factors that facilitate these conversations were  structural changes  for example  dedicated appointments  access to weight assessment data  joined up working across agencies   HCP approaches  for example  providing appropriate dietary and physical activity advice   and HCP knowledge and skills  for example  enhancing HCPs  general and weight management related skills and knowledge of child weight management services   CONCLUSION  A range of barriers exist to HCPs addressing child excess weight with parents in primary care and community settings  Actions to effect structural changes and support HCPs in developing relevant knowledge and skills are required to overcome these barriers ","Background  Religiosity is known to have a socio cultural influence on food choice  However  to date  research exploring the influence of Islam on food selection has almost exclusively focused on fasting during Ramadan and has not explored the influences of Islam on everyday food choices among Muslim people Aim  This qualitative study explored the influence of Islamic religiosity on everyday food choices among Muslim people Methods  Thirty two adult participants residing in the United Kingdom  n \u2009   faith leaders andn \u2009   lay Muslim people  were recruited from three Sunni mosques  and data was collected using semi structured interviews  The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis and a constant comparison method was applied to draw out similarities and differences between faith leaders and lay Muslim people Results  The results revealed that Islamic religiosity had an influence over food choice with two main overarching themes    Demonstrating religious obedience through food choices and     Spheres of influence on food choice  and five sub themes  a  Trusting in familiar food providers   b  Verification of halal authenticity   c  Seeking purity within food   a  The Prophet Muhammed  Peace Be Upon Him  as a role model for food choice and   b  Islamic jurisprudence Conclusion  These findings provide important insights into the influence of Islam on food choice and could be used support the design of faith informed dietary interventions among Muslim people  Further research is required to examine the role of faith informed dietary intervention in the Muslim community ","The health benefits of bariatric surgery are well documented  however  the occurrence of weight regain after surgery  along with the development of mental health difficulties poses a question of how contemporary psychology could assist to prepare people living with obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery  This research explored individuals   in the immediate pre operative and post operative population  attitudes  beliefs and experiences towards obesity and their journey to bariatric surgery  Seventeen adult participants  males n\u2009 \u2009   age range    \u2013  \u2009years  were recruited and participated in a semi structured interview  Twelve individuals participated prior to undergoing bariatric surgery  Five individuals participated in the early post operative period    \u2009months post surgery   People living with obesity displayed high optimism for positive outcomes  with participants hoping that bariatric surgery would be different to previous attempts at weight regulation  with there being a clear shift in the locus of control for weight management from self to healthcare professionals  Whilst this is adaptive  there was the presence of seemingly unrealistic optimism  with many pre surgery participants not relaying the realistic possibility of post surgery weight regain  Despite the optimism individuals feel about bariatric surgery  participants felt that the psychological factors influencing eating behaviours are not being addressed by healthcare  These findings suggest that mindfulness  mindful eating  and self compassion approaches should be incorporated into clinical practice to support weight regulation and adaption to physiological changes after bariatric surgery ","Background  Emotional eating  EE  is a disordered eating behaviour which may lead to overeating  It is not clear whether EE presents to an equal degree among adults  regardless of their body mass index  BMI  status  The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in degree of EE between adults with healthy weight  overweight and obesity  Methods  MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO databases were searched from inception up to January      for studies that reported EE scores from validated questionnaires  The quality of all included studies was assessed using the AXIS tool  Meta\u2010analysis used random effects and standardised mean difference  SMD   Heterogeneity was investigated usingI statistics and sensitivity analyses  Results  A total of    studies with      participants were included in the meta\u2010analysis  Degree of EE was greater in adults with a BMI above the healthy range  compared to adults with a healthy BMI  SMD           CI      to     I         However  subgroup analysis found that degree of EE was greater only in adults with obesity  SMD           CI      to      I        and there was no difference in degree of EE between adults with overweight and those with a healthy BMI  Conclusions  Degree of EE is greater among adults living with obesity  compared to adults with a healthy BMI  indicating a need for behavioural support to support EE among people living with obesity seeking weight management  Future research should examine the long\u2010term effectiveness of interventions for EE","BACKGROUND  People living with overweight or obesity  PLwO  can be stigmatised by healthcare professionals  HCPs   Reducing focus on weight is a proposed strategy to provide less threatening healthcare experiences  Given the lack of research on weight bias within obesity services  this study aimed to explore implicit bias among obesity specialist HCPs and explore views on non weight focused approaches METHODS  Obesity specialist HCPs were invited to a webinar   An exploration of non weight focused approaches within bariatric services   held in October       Implicit weight bias was examined using the BiasProof mobile device test  based on the Implicit Association Test  Poll data was analysed descriptively  and qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis FINDINGS     of the     HCPs who attended the webinar consented to contribute data to the study  Over half       had an implicit weight bias against PLwO  Most       agreed strongly agreed that obesity services are too weight focused and that patients should not be weighed at every appointment        Perceived benefits of taking a non weight focused approach included patient led care  reducing stigma and supporting patient wellbeing  while perceived barriers included loss of objectivity  inducing risk and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness INTERPRETATION  Our findings indicate that half of obesity specialists HCPs in our sample of    providers  who are primarily dieticians and psychologists  have an implicit weight bias against PLwO  HCPs feel that a weight focused approach within services was a barrier to patient care  but that there is a lack of alternative non weight focused measures  Further research is needed into substitute outcome measures for clinical practice  also seeking the views of PLwO  and into interventions to address implicit weight bias FUNDING  Johnson   Johnson funded the BiasProof licence and publication open access charge ","Objective  This paper reports\u00a0the study design  participant characteristics  and recruitment results of By Band Sleeve  which investigated the clinical and cost effectiveness of gastric bypass  gastric banding  and sleeve gastrectomy in adults with severe obesity in the UK Methods  A pragmatic open adaptive noninferiority trial with   year follow up was conducted  Participants were randomly assigned to bypass or band initially and to sleeve after the adaptation  Co primary end points are weight loss and health related quality of life assessed using the EQ  D utility index Results  Between December      and August       the study recruited into two groups and  after the adaptation  into three groups until September       The study screened      patients             were eligible and            were randomized    subsequently withdrew consent to use data  leaving           and     assigned to bypass  band  and sleeve  respectively  Baseline data showed high levels of obesity  mean BMI\u00a0 \u00a0    \u00a0kg m   SD       and comorbidities  e g       diabetes   low scores for health related quality of life  and high levels of anxiety and depression  e g       abnormal scores   Nutritional parameters were poor  and the average equivalized household income was low  \u00a3        Conclusions  By Band Sleeve fully recruited  Participant characteristics are consistent with contemporary patients having bariatric surgery  and therefore the results will be generalizable ","Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty  ESG  is a minimally invasive procedure that has been demonstrated in the MERIT randomised  controlled trial to result in substantial and durable additional weight loss in adults with obesity compared with lifestyle modification  LM  alone  We sought to conduct the first cost effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with class II obesity  BMI          \u2009kg m   from a national healthcare system perspective in England based on results from this study  A   state Markov model was developed comprising   BMI based health states and an absorbing death state  Baseline characteristics  utilities  and transition probabilities were informed by patient level data from the subset of patients with class II obesity in MERIT  Adverse events  AEs  were based on the MERIT safety population  Mortality was estimated by applying BMI specific hazard ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates  Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from the literature  disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I III obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data  Disutility due to AEs and the prevalence of obesity related comorbidities were based on the literature  Costs included intervention costs  AE costs  and comorbidity costs  ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an increase in quality adjusted life years  QALYs   The incremental cost effectiveness ratio  ICER  for ESG vs LM alone was \u00a3     QALY gained  ESG was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses  with no ICER estimate exceeding \u00a3       QALY gained  In probabilistic sensitivity analysis  the mean ICER was \u00a3     QALY gained and ESG remained cost effective in        of iterations at a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a3       QALY  Our study indicates that ESG is highly cost effective versus LM alone for the treatment of adults with class II obesity in England ","Background\n Liver reducing diets

research is required to determine the optimal formulation of LRD and whether women may require a lower energy LRD than men ","Background  Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension  IIH  is a neurometabolic condition severely impacting the quality of life of people living with IIH  PwIIH   Most PwIIH are overweight or live with obesity  and weight loss is recommended by healthcare professionals  HCPs  as it is central to disease management  There is currently no research evaluating patient clinician interactions when discussing weight management in IIH  The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of communication with HCPs regarding weight management from the perspective of PwIIH Methods  A cross sectional online survey was developed and distributed by the IIH UK charity via their mailing list and social media network  Eligible participants were adults with IIH who have been recommended to lose weight by their HCP  Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative responses and content analysis was used to inductively draw out themes from open ended free text responses Results  There were     respondents  One fifth of PwIIH  n               felt that HCPs were supportive and empathetic about weight management  Five themes were identified on how experiences regarding weight management for IIH can be improved  with PwIIH recommending for HCPs to      detail the relationship between IIH and weight      individualise care      give advice      provide support  and     adapt communication Conclusion  The majority of PwIIH recalled a poor experience and negative emotions when engaged in discussions regarding weight management with their HCPs  Further research should explore the HCPs perspective and evaluate interventions aiming to improve the quality of patient HCPs communication in IIH ","Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension  IIH  is associated with obesity  however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH  The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss  reduction in intracranial pressure  benefit to visual and headache outcomes  quality of life  and mental health Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO  CRD              MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant literature published from inception until   th December       Screening and quality appraisal was conducted

   Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP  Level     to      Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI \u2265  kg m  since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management  Grade A   A multi component lifestyle intervention  diet   physical activity   behaviour  had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI    kg m   Grade B   Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required  to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH ","Background  Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery  BMS  is a popular weight loss intervention worldwide  yet few scientific studies have examined variations in preoperative practices globally  This study aimed to capture global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients planned for BMS  Methods  A    item questionnaire based survey was designed and the survey link was freely distributed on social and scientific media platforms  email groups and circulated through personal connections of authors  The survey included eight parts  basic information  criteria for BMS  preoperative nutritional screening  preoperative weight loss  preoperative diets for liver size reduction  preoperative glycemic control  other laboratory investigations and preparations  decision making  education  and consents  Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data and graphs were used for representation where applicable  Results  Six hundred thirty four bariatric healthcare professionals from    countries regions completed the survey  Of these  n               were from public hospitals  n               were surgeons  and the rest were multidisciplinary professionals  More than half of respondents reported using local society association guidelines in their practice  n                The great majority of respondents routinely recommend nutritional screening preoperatively  n                mandatory preoperative diets for liver size reduction  n                routine screening for T DM  n                and mandate a glycemic control target before BMS in patients with T DM  n                However  less than half  n               recommend mandatory preoperative weight loss to all patients  Most respondents  n               recommend psychological intervention before surgery for patients diagnosed with psychological conditions  Variations were also identified in laboratory investigations and optimisation  and in the aspects of decision making  education and consent  Conclusions  This survey identified significant global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients seeking primary BMS  Our findings could facilitate future research for the determination of best practice in these areas of variations  and consensus building to guide clinical practice while we wait for that evidence to emerge ","Idiopathic intracranial hypertension  IIH  is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity  yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy  Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy  recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated  Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive  prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician  Ideally  patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy  through optimising their weight  Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy  excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications  evidence based recommendations for non IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain  The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery  with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed  provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission   Abstract copyright  \u00a9 Author s   or their employer s

  kcal  have been shown to significantly reduce liver size in preparation for laparoscopic bariatric surgery  However  pre operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre operative diets within clinical practice  Thus  our study aimed to establish the variation in  and efficacy of  pre operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at    participating UK bariatric centres between  st January      to   st December       Patient demographic data  gender  age  ethnicity   diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected  We also collected data about the pre operative diet regimes  including kcals day and duration  A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery  Baseline weight  diabetes status  diet duration and kcals day were included in the model Results A total of       patients were included in the analysis  Diets ranged from     kcal to      kcals day and lasted one week to \u2265  weeks  The most common diets followed by patients were         kcals         and lasted   weeks          The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was     kg      CI      to        Weight on the day of surgery was  on average      kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes  p         and also less for   week      kg  p        and \u2265  week diets      kg  p         compared to a   week diet  Patients on a     kcals day diet were  on average      kg lighter than       Kcals day diets on the day of surgery  p         There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of     kcal day diets and LEDs of either         kcal day  p        or          kcal day  p        Conclusions A range of pre operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK  reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area  Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre operative diets were associated with greater pre operative weight loss  Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery ","Background  Multi component lifestyle interventions are the first line treatment for obesity  Dietitians are ideally placed healthcare professionals to deliver such interventions  However  only a small proportion of patients with obesity are referred by general practice to dietitians  and the reasons for this are not clear  The present study aimed to explore general practice healthcare professionals   GPHCPs  experiences and perceptions of dietitians in the context of obesity management  Methods  A convenience sample of GPHCPs practicing in the UK was recruited via a targeted social media strategy  using virtual snowball sampling  Data were collected using semi structured interviews and analysed using framework analysis  Results  In total     participants were interviewed     general practice nurses and nine general practitioners   Experiences of referring patients with obesity for dietetic intervention resulted in two main themes   i  access barriers and  ii  the dietetic consult experience  Three themes emerged from participants  perceptions of a role for general practice dietitians   i  utilising dietetic expertise   ii  access to dietitian  and  iii  time  Participants experienced barriers to accessing dietitians for obesity management and felt that having a dietitian working within their general practice team would help address this  Having a dietitian embedded within their general practice team was perceived to have the potential to alleviate GPHCPs  clinical time pressures  offer opportunities for upskilling  and may improve patient engagement with obesity management  Conclusions  GPHCPs perceived that embedding a dietitian within their general practice team would be valuable and beneficial for obesity management  Our findings provide support for the funding of general practice dietitian roles in the UK ","BACKGROUND  Multi component lifestyle interventions that incorporate diet  physical activity and behaviour change are effective for weight management  However  it is not clear whether delivery in a group or one to one format influences weight loss efficacy  The present study aimed to systematically review the evidence of the effectiveness of group compared to one to one multi component lifestyle interventions for weight management METHODS  MEDLINE  EMBASE  CINAHL  CENTRAL and ISRCTN databases were searched from inception up to February      for randomised controlled trials comparing group versus one to one multi component lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with a body mass index \u2265    kg m     The primary outcome was weight loss  kg  at    months and the secondary outcome was attainment of \u2265   weight loss at    months  Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool  Meta analysis used random effects and estimated risk ratios and continuous inverse variance methods  Heterogeneity was investigated using I  statistics and sensitivity analyses RESULTS  Seven randomised controlled trials with      participants were included  Group interventions were favoured over one to one interventions for weight loss at    months       kg      confidence interval        to       I          Participants of group interventions were more likely to attain \u2265   weight loss at    months relative to one to one interventions  relative risk             confidence interval              I         CONCLUSIONS  Group multi component lifestyle interventions are superior for weight loss compared to one to one interventions with respect to adult weight management  Further research is required to determine whether specific components of group interventions can explain the superiority of weight loss outcomes in group interventions ","Background Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity  However  without recommended follow up it has long term risks  Aim To investigate whether nutritional and weight monitoring in primary care meets current clinical guidance  after patients are discharged from specialist bariatric care  Design and setting Retrospective cohort study in primary care practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data in the UK    January      to    January        Method Participants were adults who had had bariatric surgery with a minimum of   years  follow up post surgery  as this study focused on patients discharged from specialist care  at   years post surgery   Outcomes were the annual proportion of patients from   years post surgery with a record of recommended nutritional screening blood tests  weight measurement  and prescription of nutritional supplements  and the proportions with nutritional deficiencies based on blood tests  Results A total of      participants were included in the study  and median follow up post surgery was         \u2013     years  Between     and     of these patients had an annual weight measurement  The greatest proportions of patients with a record of annual nutritional blood tests were for tests routinely conducted in primary care  for example  recorded haemoglobin measurement varied between        n             and        n              Annual proportions of blood tests specific to bariatric surgery were low  for example  recorded copper measurement varied between       n           and       n            where recommended  Results indicated that the most common deficiency was anaemia  Annual proportions of patients with prescriptions for recommended nutritional supplements were low  Conclusion This study suggests that patients who have bariatric surgery are not receiving the recommended nutritional monitoring after discharge from specialist care  GPs and patients should be supported to engage with follow up care  Future research should aim to understand the reasons underpinning these findings ","Background  The COVID    pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the delivery of weight management programmes  WMPs   in order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare professionals  Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID    pandemic  The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors  Methods  All patients enrolled on a face to face group WMP  which constitutes part of a Tier   WMP delivered by the NHS  at the time of the COVID    pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP  Baseline data included weight  BMI  age  gender  ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation  IMD  quintile score  The outcomes were accept decline transfer to the virtual group WMP  Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake  Results  The     participants were included  of which        n\u00a0 \u00a0     accepted  After adjusting for gender  deprivation and BMI  older patients  OR             CI                p\u00a0 \u00a0       and Black  Asian and Minority Ethnicity  BAME  patients  OR                           p\u00a0 \u00a0       were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP  Conclusion  Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed  particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID    in these two groups  and the links between obesity and poor COVID    outcomes ","Abstract                Purpose of the Review                Pathways for obesity prevention and treatment are well documented  yet the prevalence of obesity is rising  and access to treatment  including bariatric surgery  is limited  This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges                               Recent Findings                Evidence for tier    community based lifestyle intervention  and tier    specialist weight management services  is limited  and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier   remains uncertain  Treatment access  rigidity in pathways  uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care                               Summary                More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments  treatment flexibility  addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long term health outcomes  Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways  A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post bariatric surgery care for those who need it ","Background  Many bariatric surgical centers mandate achieving weight loss targets through medical weight management  MWM  programs before offering bariatric surgery  but the evidence for this is unclear  Objectives  To examine the relationship between weight changes during     MWM  and     preoperative low energy diet  LED   and weight changes at    and    months after surgery  Setting  Multicenter community  and acute based MWM services referring to one regional bariatric center  United Kingdom  Methods  A retrospective cohort study of patients who attended MWM and then underwent a primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure  adjustable gastric banding  LAGB   or Roux en Y gastric bypass  RYGB   in a single bariatric center in the United Kingdom between      and       Data were collected from patient electronic records  Results  Two hundred eight patients were included  LAGB n        RYGB n        Anthropometric data were available for       and       of participants at    and    months  respectively  There was no relationship between weight loss during MWM and after surgery at either    or    months  Weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB  \u03b2         P         and less weight loss after RYGB  \u03b2   \u2212      P         at    months  after adjusting for age  sex  ethnicity  baseline weight  and LED duration  Conclusions  Weight loss in MWM does not predict greater weight loss outcomes up to    months after LAGB or RYGB  Greater weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB and less weight loss after RYGB  Our results suggest that patients should not be denied bariatric surgery because of not achieving weight loss in MWM  Weight loss responses to preoperative LEDs as a predictor of postsurgical weight loss requires further investigation ","","Introduction  Obesity is common  prevalence      in older adults  \u2265   years   Bariatric surgery  BS  is the most effective intervention resulting in sustained weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits  However  the outcomes of BS in older patients are unknown Methods  A retrospective study utilising the bariatric database from a single UK NHS BS centre  We identified all older patients  aged \u2265   years old at surgery  who had BS between      and      and all were matched to    typical  aged controls     \u2013    years old  the age IQR for BS patients at our centre  for surgical procedure  gender  referral body mass index  BMI  and diabetes status  Data were obtained from both local and GP records  Survival was compared between cases and matched controls using Kaplan Meier estimators and the log rank test up to   years post operatively Results  The mean age  S D   for cases  n     and controls  n     were          and    years        respectively  Mean BMI was    kg m             were men and     had Type   diabetes  There was    mortality in both cases and controls at    days post operative  Over   years post operative follow up  there was       n    mortality in older adults             mortality  n    in controls  P        No deaths were due to surgical complication  At   years post operative  BMI reduction in older adults     \u00b1    kg m   was significantly less than younger controls      \u00b1    kg m    t     \u2212       P         Meanwhile there was no significant difference in change in HbA c among patients with Type   Diabetes  P        Conclusion  In older adults  BS was not associated with increased    day mortality or surgical related mortality up to   years post surgery  BS resulted in clinically meaningful BMI reductions in older patients at   years post surgery  However  BMI reductions were significantly greater in younger patients at   years post surgery  The impact of surgery on glycaemic control was similar across older and younger adults with Type   diabetes  BS is a valid option of treatment in older patients with obesity  future studies need to examine the impact of surgery on functionality and quality of life in this patient group ","Introduction  Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are more likely to have obesity  However  it is not clear whether social deprivation has an impact on accessing and the outcomes of bariatric surgery  The aim of our study was to explore the effect of indices of deprivation on access to bariatric surgery and its outcomes Methods  Cross sectional prospective evaluation in a single centre in England of all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery in       Deprivation was assessed using the index of multiple deprivation  IMD          which ranks areas within England from the most  IMD Decile    to least deprived  IMD Decile      We extracted lower layer super output area IMD Deciles according to the patients post code at time of bariatric surgery as well as the    month post surgical weight loss and type of surgery Results  Of the     patients who underwent bariatric surgery       n      lived in areas within the    rd IMD Decile  most deprived areas           th  and          th  IMD Decile   There was no relationship between the type of bariatric surgery offered and IMD Decile  There was no relationship between IMD Decile tertiles                 and   weight loss at one year either across all bariatric surgical interventions  r         P       r         P       or when analysed according to surgery type Conclusions  People undergoing bariatric surgery typically lived in more deprived areas which might be anticipated by the correlation between deprivation and obesity as well as the relative levels of deprivation within our catchment area suggesting by this measure that deprivation is not a clear barrier to accessing bariatric surgery  however data was not available on patients who did not undergo surgery and this may reveal potential inequalities with accessing bariatric surgery both at the point of referral from primary care as well as in the transition from Tier   to Tier   services  Deprivation does not seem to have an effect on weight loss at   year post bariatric surgery  This data suggests that the bariatric surgery service is accessible to people across all IMD Deciles within our catchment area Keywords  Obesity  social deprivation  healthcare inequa","","BackgroundType   diabetes  T DM  is increasing in prevalence worldwide  and is closely linked to obesity  Binge Eating Disorder  BED  and Night Eating Syndrome  NES  are eating disorders that are common in obesity  and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T DM  Therefore  the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T DM MethodsWe conducted a systematic review  The databases MEDLINE  CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria  including patients  \u2009   years old  with T DM  and BED and or NES  The reference lists of included studies were also searched  Meta analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest ResultsA total of    studies    included NES  were included in this systematic review  The number screened for BED and NES were      and      participants  respectively  Point prevalence was    \u2013     for BED and    \u2013     for NES  Patients with T DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI  There was no statistically significant difference in HbA c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA c ConclusionsBED and NES are common in adults with T DM  and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T DM  However  only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA c in patients with T DM  Hence  further well designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T DM  Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T DM ","We examined the relationship between weight changes after preoperative glucagon like peptide   receptor agonist  GLP  RA  treatment and weight changes from the start of medical weight management  MWM  until   \u2009months after bariatric surgery in patients with type   diabetes in a retrospective cohort study  A total of    patients        women  median  interquartile range  age            years  were included  The median  interquartile range  weight loss from start of MWM until   \u2009months post surgery was                      GLP  RA treatment during MWM resulted in                  weight loss  Weight loss during GLP  RA treatment predicted weight loss from the start of MWM until   \u2009months post surgery  but not postoperative weight loss after adjustment  The proportion of weight loss from start of MWM to   \u2009months post surgery attributed to GLP  RA treatment was negatively associated with that attributed to surgery  after adjustment  In conclusion  weight change after GLP  RA treatment predicted the weight loss achieved by a combination of MWM and bariatric surgery  but not weight loss induced by surgery only  Failure to lose weight after GLP  RA treatment should not be considered a barrier to undergoing bariatric surgery ","","","","","","","","Utilising multiple disjoint paths in multiple channels can improve network performance by enabling a node to reroute data along discovered paths seamlessly when link failure is detected  However  depending on a stale invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover fromthe broken link and degrade the network performance  In this paper  we propose a new MAC protocol  RIVC MB  to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol  The reliability of transmitting re routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover  Waiting time to access the medium is also improved  when a node is attempting to access a busy medium  by re routing the data packet via the alternative route  The RIVC MB protocol uses the cross layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals  The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS   simulator  Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto  end delay  and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer  It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network ","Utilising multiple channels can increase the wireless ad hoc network capacity  Receiver Directed Transmission protocol  RDT  is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface  RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation  Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface  dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT  such as  hidden terminal and deafness problems  This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity  Additionally  the paper investigates the effect of node density  mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance  NS   simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme  Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput  the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol ","The route recovery algorithm is a crucial part of an ad hoc routing protocol  Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol  The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected  However  we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi Channel  RMMMC   which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route  When link failure is detected  the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered  Furthermore  the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures  Unlike other route recovery approaches  nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver  The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns   simulator  Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio  throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end to end delay in a dense network ","MANET routing protocols are designed based on the assumption that all nodes cooperate without maliciously disrupting the operation of the routing protocol  AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of network performance in the presence of blackhole attack  The paper introduces a new concept of Self Protocol Trustiness  SPT  in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior  We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism  BRM  to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol  It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms  but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious  No modifications to the packet formats are needed  so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes  and no extra communication  Using NS  simulation  we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV  showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack ","MANET routing protocols are designed based on the assumption that all nodes cooperate without maliciously disrupting the operation of the routing protocol  A large number of attack types of varying severity are threatening MANET  Dynamic Source Routing  DSR  is a well known reactive MANET routing protocol that does not support security of routing messages  In this paper  we study the performance of both DSR and its flow state extension routing protocols in the presence of blackhole  grayhole  selfish and flooding attacks  We conclude that the performance of flow state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks  Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics  Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR  All the attacks greatly increase the end to end delay  an effect particularly marked in a static network ","AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that does not support security of routing messages  SAODV is an extension of the AODV routing protocol that is designed to fulfil security features of the routing messages  In this paper  we study the performance of both AODV and SAODV routing protocols under the presence of blackhole  grayhole  selfish and flooding attacks  We conclude that the performance of SAODV is better than AODV in the presence of blackhole  grayhole and selfish attacks while its performance is worse than AODV in the presence of flooding attack  The blackhole and flooding attacks have a severe impact on the AODV and SAODV performance while the grayhole and selfish attacks have less significant effect on it ","AODV is a well known reactive protocol designed for MANET routing  All MANET routing protocols are designed based on the assumption that all nodes cooperate without maliciously disrupting the operation of the routing protocol  In this paper  we study the performance of AODV routing protocol in the presence of some of the well de\ufb01ned attacks in MANET  We use NS   network simulator to analyse the impacts of blackhole  grayhole  sel\ufb01sh and \ufb02ooding attacks on AODV protocol performance  While the blackhole and \ufb02ooding attacks have a severe impact on the AODV performance  the sel\ufb01sh and grayhole attacks have less signi\ufb01cant effect on it ","AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of throughput when malicious intruders flood the network with bogus route requests  We introduce a simple mechanism to resist such attacks that canbe incorporated into any reactive routing protocol  It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms  but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious  No modifications to the packet formats are needed  so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes and no extra communication  Using NS  simulation  we compare the performance of networks using AODV under flooding attacks with and without our mechanism  showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a flooding attack ","MANET routing protocols have many vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior  In this paper  we present a vulnerability analysis of AODV  We simulate four routing attacks to analyse their impacts on AODV protocol using NS   network simulator  These attacks are blackhole  grayhole  selfish and flooding attacks  The blackhole and flooding attacks have a severe impact on the network performance while the selfish and grayhole attacks have less significant effect on the network performance ","","In this paper  we analyzed the token based security protocol     using the GNY logic to determine the security flaws of the protocol  We found out that the token based protocol has two security flaws  The first one leads to an active attack which enables the intruder to get sensitive information whereas the second may result in gumming up the network and thus reducing the efficiency of its operation  Therefore  this protocol can not be approved for authentication  We conclude our paper by proposing a modification to the token based protocol that overcomes these attacks ",""]
