ET AL criteria for bariatric surgery across England. Responses were presented descriptively and mapped across England. Responses were received from out of ICSs, with reporting that they provide commissioned medical weight management pro- grammes and funding bariatric surgery. Thirteen reported using criteria that were not compliant with NICE guidance. A large area of the country centred around the East of England does not have a bariatric unit reducing access to care. There is signifi- cant geographical variation in the availability of both bariatric and specialist medical weight management services across England, with large portions of the country with- out local access to a service or no service at all. Where services are available, there is significant inconsistency in eligibility for bariatric surgery despite nationally available guidance. K E Y W O R D S bariatric surgery, commissioning, obesity, specialist weight management, tier , tier What is already known about this subject (cid: ) Bariatric surgery is a life-changing intervention for people living with obesity associated with significant health gain. (cid: ) Within England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) makes recom- mendations about which patients are likely to benefit from bariatric surgery. (cid: ) Commissioning decisions relating to service provision and treatment criteria are made locally within England in geographical commissioning areas called Integrated Care Systems (ICSs). What this study adds (cid: ) Many ICSs apply additional non-evidence-based criteria for bariatric surgery not supported by NICE restricting access to treatment. (cid: ) Parts of England do not have medical weight management services. (cid: ) Parts of England do not have bariatric surgery units. (cid: ) Taken together, this leads to significant geographical variation in care. | I N T RO DU CT I O N interventions typically commissioned by Local Authorities, Tier multidisciplinary team-led specialist weight management services The prevalence of adult obesity in England, defined as a body mass and Tier bariatric surgery.

However, the prevalence and impact of a healthy weight body mass index (BMI) at disease Accepted April presentation is not known.

This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study (IIH Life) based KEYWORDS on a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology IIH service, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, United Pseudotumor cerebri; vision; Kingdom, recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between and . Those with headache; prognosis; weight; a presenting BMI were included. The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR OCT imaging; papilloedema visual acuity, Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation (PMD), optical coherence tomo- graphy (OCT) measurements, and headache outcomes of frequency, severity, and Headache Impact Test- score. Three hundred seventy-five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI. About . % of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and . % BMI < kg\/m . The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity; however, OCT papilloe- dema measures were similar. The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss. There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity. The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity, with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity. No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes. Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients.

PBH develops relatively late after surgery and often after discharge from post-surgical follow-up by bariatric teams, leading to variability in diagnosis and management in non-specialist centres.

Endocrine Connections ( ) e Aim: The overall aim was to improve and standardise clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of PBH. The objectives were: ( ) to undertake an up-to-date review of the current literature; ( ) to formulate practical and evidence- based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH; ( ) to recommend future avenues for research in this condition. Method: A scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search. A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders. Outcome: We make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH, including criteria for diagnosis and recognition, as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored. Plain English summary Post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery. In this condition, people develop low blood sugar occurring about \u2013 h after meals, leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger, sweating, anxiety, palpitations and even blackouts and fainting. PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes. The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow-up after their surgery, which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non-specialist healthcare centres. The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care. To address this problem, the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition. The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians, surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss, and hormone specialists.

(cid: ) Bariatric surgery is highly effective for weight loss, with an average of % weight loss over years and is a recommended treatment for individuals with severe obesity. (cid: ) Despite the benefits of bariatric surgery in terms of physical health, the literature reports that the psychological benefits of bariatric surgery may have a limited time effect of approxi- mately years before returning to the levels observed pre-surgery. (cid: ) Hence, pre-surgery behavioural and psychological interventions are essential to facilitate the post-surgery period of physiological change and adjustment to life after bariatric surgery. What this study adds? (cid: ) This study explores the attitudes, beliefs, and experiences of individuals living with obesity who are preparing to undergo bariatric surgery or have recently undergone a bariatric sur- gery procedure. (cid: ) This study provides insights from the patient perspective to guide healthcare professionals in providing early intervention strategies to support patients during their bariatric surgery jour- ney, focusing on behavioural and psychological drivers that may impact eating behaviours and adjustment to life after bariatric surgery. (cid: ) The findings of this study support that integrating mindfulness, mindful eating, and self- compassion before and after bariatric surgery could be beneficial for patients to support pos- itive adaptive coping mechanisms and to promote helpful eating behaviour to optimise response to bariatric surgery, especially for individuals who experience self-blame and self- stigmatisation. | I N T RO DU CT I O N design characteristics.

Preprint Abstract Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with obesity, however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss, reduction in intracranial pressure, benefit to visual and headache outcomes, quality of life, and mental health. Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD ). MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant th literature published from inception until December . Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers. Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology. Results A total of studies were included. Bariatric surgery resulted in . - . kg weight loss at months (Level - to ++). Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between . to . kg weight loss (Level + to ++). Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP (- . cm H O) at months (Level ++), followed by multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide (- . cm H O) at months (Level +), and then a very low energy diet intervention (- . cm H O) at months (Level ++). The least ICP reduction was shown at months after completing a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention (- . cm H O) (Level ++). Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP (Level ++ to ++). Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI \u2265 kg\/m since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management (Grade A). A multi- component lifestyle intervention (diet + physical activity + behaviour) had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI < kg\/m (Grade B). Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required, to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH. Copyright Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP), pulse-synchronous tinnitus, headaches and papilloedema, with the potential risk of permanent visual loss . Most people living with IIH are also living with obesity . Population studies have observed the increased incidence of IIH in those with an increased body mass index (BMI) , and an elevated BMI is shown to be directly associated with greater risk of a diagnosis of IIH . Furthermore, a relationship between BMI and visual outcomes has been established. A study found patients with BMI > kg\/m were more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro-ophthalmology visit and every kg\/m increase in BMI increased the odds of severe visual loss by . times . IIH is emerging from being a disease of the neuro-ophthalmic axis to being a distinct \u2013 metabolic disease, where the underlying pathophysiology may be modified by weight loss . Moreover, IIH has been demonstrated to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promotes further weight gain . At the same time, psychiatric disorders are sevenfold more common in people with IIH compared to the general population , which may result from common biological pathways related to hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex (HPA)-axis dysfunction , which may mean weight management is more challenging for people living with IIH. Obesity results from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factors, and there is a strong genetic component underlying interindividual variation in body weight . As , a result, the human body is biologically hard-wired to prevent weight loss . This is a challenge for the treatment of IIH since excess body weight has an impact on IIH development and improvement. Moderate weight gain of - % is associated with a greater risk of developing IIH among both people with and without obesity . Meanwhile, weight loss \u2013 in the range of - % has been reported to lead to remission and weight re-gain has been found to be a risk factor for disease recurrence . Copyright Sustained weight loss therefore is essential for long-term remission of the disease. However, clinical practice is varied in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategies for IIH. Indeed, sustained weight loss has been demonstrated to be essential for long-term remission of the disease . The optimal weight loss method for IIH is yet to be determined , especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify, evaluate, and summarise the relevant published studies relating to weight loss interventions for IIH in terms of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcomes such as vision and headache. A second aim of the study was to convene a panel of experts in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice points to help guide clinicians who may not have formal training in weight management. Methods This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (identifier CRD ) and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines . Search strategy th The databases MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception up to December via EBSCO using a comprehensive search strategy (eAppendix ), which was tested and refined to maximise sensitivity for retrieving relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. The Boolean operator \u201cOR\u201d was used to separate each term within each concept, and each concept was concatenated by the operator \u201cAND\u201d. When possible, Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were used to expand the search language. The search strategy was identical in both databases, with minor adaptation to the coding to suit Copyright individual database settings. References were imported into Covidence software for de- duplication and screening. Inclusion and exclusion criteria For studies to be included, the study population criteria were aged \u2265 years old, diagnosed with IIH and with a baseline BMI \u2265 kg\/m . Studies were included if a weight management intervention was provided and weight change between pre- and post-intervention was reported. Reviews, expert opinions, case reports and conference proceedings were excluded. Papers selection and data extraction Two reviewers (SA and SPM) independently and in duplicate screened titles and abstracts and then screened full-text reports for all identified studies. Reviewers were masked to each other\u2019s responses until each screening stage was complete, utilising Covidence. Disagreement was resolved by consensus between reviewers. Data extraction Study characteristics were documented and the criteria to which the participants were diagnosed with IIH were recorded. The primary outcome of interest in this systematic review was weight change, measured either by absolute weight (kg or %), excess weight (%) (calculated by absolute weight loss \/ (baseline weight \u2013 ideal body weight) x ) or absolute BMI (kg\/m ) change. The secondary outcomes were changes in ICP, visual and headache outcomes, and self-reported quality of life measures (e.g., Short Form (SF- ) Health Survey ). Specifically for visual outcomes we documented visual acuity, visual field type and output, papilloedema and whether it was subjectively graded or quantified by optic coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Headache outcomes included headache symptoms, headache phenotype assessment type, Headache impact test (HIT)- , headache frequency, Copyright severity score and analgesic usage. Data were extracted by one reviewer (SA\/SPM\/FCh) and peer reviewed by the another (SA\/SPM\/FCh), using an electronic data extraction form. Data analysis Since the included studies were diverse, heterogeneity between studies in terms of the interventions, duration of follow-up and method of outcome measurement precluded pooling of results with meta-analysis. Instead, a narrative synthesis approach was employed to synthesise the findings from included studies. Quality of evidence The quality and risk of bias of the included studies was assessed at the study level and each study was assigned an evidence level for the weight loss, ICP, headache and visual outcomes, based on Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology (eAppendix ), by two independent reviewers (SA and SPM). Practice recommendations The process of SIGN methodology (eAppendix ) was followed to formulate evidence- based clinical recommendations. A multi-disciplinary recommendation panel was formed of relevant professional groups with experience and expertise in IIH and weight management. The recommendation panel included a dietitian (SA), clinical psychologist (FCa), endocrinologist (AAT), bariatric surgeons (DJP, CP), neurologists (AJS, FCh), neuro- ophthalmologists (SPM, SW), and a patient representative (AD). The expert panel convened to discuss the evidence base identified from the systematic review and formulate draft recommendations. The draft recommendations together with their grading were circulated within the guideline group in an iterative process until consensus was achieved. Where an evidence base was lacking, Good Practice Points (GPP) were formulated to provide clinicians with short pieces of advice that the recommendation panel deemed were essential to good clinical practice. Copyright Results After removal of duplicates, database searches yielded studies. Of these, were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Forty-seven publications were then excluded after full text review, due to participants having a BMI < kg\/m (n= ), study design (n= ), weight change not reported (n= ) and the absence of weight loss intervention (n= ). A total , , \u2013 of studies were included, of which studies were original studies and five studies , \u2013 were reports of included studies. The study selection process is summarised in Figure .

Copyright Weight loss interventions Eight studies (n= participants) reported on bariatric surgery interventions, including , , \u2013 , , , , , , gastric band (n= studies), sleeve gastrectomy (n= studies) and , , , , gastric bypass (n= studies). Twelve studies reported on lifestyle weight , , , management interventions (n= participants); of which four studies were dietary , , , \u2013 interventions alone, seven studies were multi-component interventions (diet + physical activity + behavioural interventions) and in one study patients independently sourced a weight management intervention of their choosing (eTable ). Weight loss outcomes In studies where outcomes were pooled across bariatric surgery procedures (gastric band, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy), mean weight loss was . to . kg at months , (Level - to ++ ) (Table ). However, where weight loss outcomes were reported at the procedure level, the greatest weight loss was seen for gastric bypass procedures (n= participants) with a significant weight reduction of . to . kg at to months and excess weight loss of . to . % at months to a median of months (Level - to - , , ). Sleeve gastrectomy (n= participants) resulted in weight loss of . to . kg at , to months (Level to - ). Excess weight loss ranged from . to . % at months , (Level ), and . % excess weight loss at a median follow-up of months (Level - ); statistical significance was not reported. Weight loss outcomes after gastric banding (n= participants) varied. In one study, a mean . kg weight gain observed months post-gastric band procedure (Level - ). In other studies, excess weight loss was . % at a , mean of months and a lesser . % at a median of months (Level to - ); although statistical significance was not reported for either study. At months (Level - ), gastric bypass was shown to result in the greatest weight loss (kg) compared to both sleeve gastrectomy and gastric band (p=< . ) at months. At Copyright longitudinal follow-up (Level - ), weight loss was greater for gastric bypass (median follow-up months) compared to gastric banding (median follow-up months) (p= . ), but there was no difference between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (median follow-up months) (p= . ). The greatest weight loss with a lifestyle intervention was reported using a VLED dietary intervention with a . kg at months (Level + ). Short-term dietary interventions resulted , in modest reductions in BMI of . to . kg\/m at to months (Level - to + ). At a median of to months follow-up of a dietary intervention, weight loss was not significant however the addition of . g\/day of metformin led to a mean weight loss of . % and . % in patients with hyperinsulinaemia and PCOS, respectively (Level + ). A -month multi- component intervention resulted in a mean weight loss of . kg and . kg for multi- component intervention only and multi-component intervention + acetazolamide, respectively \u2013 (Level + ). A -month multi-component intervention did not result in significant weight , loss at either - or -months follow-up (Level - to ++ ). Intracranial pressure outcomes While ten studies recorded baseline ICP measured by lumbar puncture opening , , , , , \u2013 , , , pressure (Table ), only three studies measured change in ICP following weight management intervention. Bariatric surgery offered the greatest mean reduction (- . cm H O) in ICP at months (Level ++ ), followed by a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide (- . cm H O) (Level + ), and then a -month VLED (diet only) intervention (- . cm H O) (Level ++ ), then a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention (- . cm H O) (Level + ). The least ICP reduction was shown at months after completing a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention (- . cm H O) (Level ++ ). Reduction in body weight was also shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP , (Level ++ to ++ ). Copyright Visual outcomes , , , , Only five studies reported the visual acuity (eTable ). Five studies gave brief descriptions of visual field loss but did not detail the type of visual fields that were \u2013 , , performed while one study did not report visual field outcomes . Six studies reported the perimetric mean deviation (PMD) from the - Humphrey visual field analyser , , , , , (Level to + ). Five studies commented on the presence or absence of , , , papilloedema (Level ), whereas formal Fris\u00e9n grading, and OCT imaging were , , , , , recorded in six studies (level - to + ). Only one study noted significant improvements in visual acuity, low contrast visual acuity, HVF and OCT measures of papilledema with a % reduction in weight (level ++). Generally, visual parameters improved over time, however when a direct comparison was made in between groups there was no significance found in most studies (eTable ). In IIHTT there was a modest, but statistically significant, improvement in the visual field MD, in conjunction with a significant difference in the weight loss between those on placebo and multicomponent intervention and those in the acetazolamide and multicomponent intervention arm (acetazolamide: \u2212 . kg, from . kg to . kg; placebo: \u2212 . kg, from . kg to . kg; treatment effect, \u2212 . kg, % CI, \u2212 . to \u2212 . kg; P < . ) (Level +). A mediation analysis of the primary outcome PMD was performed to determine the degree to which the effect of acetazolamide on PMD was mediated by its effect on weight, but this was found to be not significant (p= . ). The IIHTT and IIHWT , RCTs therefore did not find visual parameters that were directly associated with extent of weight loss (level + to +) and all the other studies reporting visual outcomes did not directly compare changes in visual outcomes with weight outcomes (level to level ++). Headache outcomes Few studies provided detailed headache outcomes (Level ++ to +, eTable ). Only one study noted significant reduction in headache frequency, severity, analgesic use and HIT- Copyright scores with VLED also delivering a % reduction in weight at months (Level ++ ). In the , two RCTs there was no supporting evidence of a significant reduction of headache following weight loss (Level ++ to +). Notably in the IIHTT study there was no correlation between headache burden, as assessed by HIT- , and BMI at either baseline or subsequent follow-up at months (Level +). Quality of Life outcomes , Only two studies reported on quality-of-life; both used the Short Form (SF- ) Health Survey (Level ++). After bariatric surgery , there were significant improvements in physical (p=< . ) but not mental component scores at months (Level ++). Immediately after a -month VLED (diet alone) intervention , there was a significant improvement in both the physical (p=< . ) and mental (p= . ) component scores (Level +). However, this improvement was not sustained at months after the VLED intervention had ended. Mental health outcomes Only one study reported changes in self-reported anxiety and depression, assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) . There was no significant change in anxiety in either the multi-component lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery intervention groups; however, there was a significant (p= . ) reduction in depression scores (- . ; % CI - . to - . ) at months in the bariatric surgery intervention group only (Level ++). Graded recommendations for clinical practice The expert panel identified consensus-based recommendations for weight management in people with IIH based upon the evidence identified within the systematic review and graded according to the quality of available evidence. Where evidence was not available for IIH populations, GPP were formulated based upon evidence extrapolated from obesity literature. The graded recommendations are shown in Table . Copyright Discussion The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people living with IIH is not only because weight loss reduces ICP, but also that it reduces mortality and reduces the burden of prevalent and incident obesity related complications . Weight loss is recognised as a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH. This study sought to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH, which was identified as research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership . The panel made graded recommendations based upon the evidence identified by this systematic review, and detailed clinical guidance in good practice points from the obesity literature (Table ). While there was one RCT demonstrating Level ++ evidence for the directed use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to months , and one cross over study (Level +) utilising a VLED for months which demonstrated efficacy in terms of ICP, visual and headache outcomes, these two studies have not been replicated. The results of this analysis therefore demonstrated the shortage of high-quality evidence, as there were no studies that could be directly compared due to different weight management methods being used, and a lack of standardised outcome measures. Sustained long term weight loss should be considered as a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patients with IIH. Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counselled sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH. They should have their weight measured and BMI calculated to assess the weight management options and monitor the intervention efficacy. Although there are no RCTs that evaluated the measurement of overweight and obesity compared to not measuring these outcomes, the panel agreed that this aspect of IIH patient care was essential. The degree of weight loss required for IIH symptom improvement was less clear as studies reported amount of weight lost with a variety of outcome measures. There were no studies Copyright evaluating the time where the minimum amount of weight lost was correlated with the point of disease remission. There was Level + evidence that demonstrated a reduction of weight between - % was required to achieve disease remission. In the VLED cross over study % of body weight loss was correlated with reduction in ICP, resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcomes and the IIHWT disease remission was defined as ICP to return to normal levels at cmH . It is therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle interventions delivered in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss required to induce remission of IIH. The panel considered this evidence and recommended the target weight loss should be % for IIH disease remission. However, the panel acknowledged that this goal is unlikely to be achieved via a lifestyle intervention alone, and a realistic goal may be - % weight loss , which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptoms. There were no studies evaluating solely physical activity interventions in IIH. Physical activity could be recommended as part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss . Behaviour therapy has been shown to be a useful adjunct when incorporated into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance . Licensed anti-obesity medications (AOMs) did not feature in this study, as there were no studies with primary aims of using pharmacotherapy for weight loss in IIH. It was noteworthy that there was inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction . Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide and topiramate, and to a lesser extent zonisamide, are used to manage IIH and have previously been clinical observed to reduce weight. The method by which acetazolamide causes weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia (a salty, rancid or metallic taste sensation that persists in the mouth), nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting and diarrhoea. Acetazolamide is not well tolerated in this patient group with up to % of people discontinuing the medicine . In our systematic review, it was interesting to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and ICP at months following the directed use of acetazolamide . Copyright Bariatric surgery had the greatest sustained weight loss up to months . Clinicians managing IIH may be reluctant to refer patients for bariatric surgery, due to funding access and misconceptions regarding the safety of bariatric surgery, such as operative mortality, excess skin, and nutritional optic atrophy. Physicians may be concerned about CSF shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery; however bariatric surgery has been shown to be safer and more cost-effective than CSF shunting . Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedures were superior to gastric banding, in terms of weight loss and ICP reduction in people with IIH. For obesity, gastric bypass has been found to be the most clinically effective and most cost-effective intervention compared to other weight management programmes and has the highest quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains . Superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in IIH may be explained by the enhanced postprandial glucagon-like peptide- (GLP- ) secretion, as emerging data found that exogenously administered GLP- significantly reduces ICP without weight loss . Another key consideration when understanding the impact of an intervention is the natural history of the disease including disease duration. This could have an impact on outcomes, for example in people who have had the disease for many years it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that has occurred due to axonal loss and hence why in studies with long disease duration the visual field measures may not improve . Likewise, papilloedema may acutely be present, and without intervention may regress to the mean. Strengths of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review, which was prospectively registered on PROSPERO and all screening, data extraction and quality assessment was blinded and conducted by two reviewers. The evidence was translated into clinical recommendations which were made by multi-disciplinary experts in obesity and IIH, Copyright hence supporting the translation of the research for clinical application. There are certain limitations to the study. The included studies all used different outcome measures, and a variety of weight loss methods. This meant a meta-analysis was not able to be performed, due to study heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in IIH studies evaluating weight loss methods needs to be considered when planning future clinical trials in IIH. We also only included published studies, which means there was potential for publication bias. As meta- analysis was precluded, it was not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias using funnel plot . The study populations of our included studies were predominately female, a reflection of IIH being less prevalent in males , however the findings are therefore not generalisable to males. Specifically, there is a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in IIH in a male population, and for both genders at a lower BMI of - kg\/m . None of the studies included women who were pregnant, which is an area in need of evaluating, as it has been recommended that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input . Most of the studies were of short duration, with only one study reporting outcomes longitudinally at years. The longer the reporting period, the more missing data occurred. However, future studies should be encouraged to include long term outcomes, to determine cost-effectiveness and intervention durability. People with IIH who have obesity, compared to healthy weight, have significantly lower health-related quality of life scores . Moreover, obesity and weight gain have been found to be independent predictors of poorer mental health-related quality of life . Psychiatric symptoms in association with IIH are usually poorly described and underestimated in the literature, but the prevalence is reported to be as high as % . Given that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patients\u2019 engagement and adherence to weight management interventions, and indeed IIH treatments, this requires investigation. Hence, future studies should collect quality of life and Copyright psychiatric outcome measures to evaluate the influence of weight management interventions, and include long term outcome data collection, to assess durability of the intervention. Conclusions We advocate for obesity to be viewed as a chronic disease with complex contributory associations and prognostic implications to IIH, rather than merely a risk factor. Weight loss should be seen as an important tool in the management of IIH. The biological drivers of obesity may explain why short-term weight management interventions are often insufficient for long-term disease remission. The hierarchy of effect in weight loss methods seem to be analogous to the reduction of ICP, with bariatric surgery having the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the IIH population. However, not all patients will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention. In such case, multi-component lifestyle interventions should be provided; but it should be acknowledged that weight loss is likely to be modest and IIH disease remission is therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in IIH symptoms.

Repeat measurements should be taken to determine long-term weight trajectory and effectiveness of weight management treatment. Obtain a complete drug history. Anti-psychotic medications can cause weight gain GPP and precipitate IIH. Where a temporal relationship is noted between weight gain and a causative medicine the clinical team should discuss this with the mental health team and patient. Goal for weight loss and weight maintenance Discuss sensitively with patients that obesity is a complex metabolic disorder and GPP weight management has been shown to improve some symptoms of IIH and may support IIH disease remission. Discuss with patients that the goal of weight management is to maintain a lower GPP body weight over the long term. Counsel patients that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease and therefore total GPP lifelong remission from obesity may not be achievable. Advise patients that weight loss of - % contributes to IIH disease remission, C (EL +) however counsel patients this may only be achieved via intervention with bariatric surgery. Advise patients a multi-component lifestyle intervention (dietary therapy + physical GPP activity + behaviour) is an alternative treatment that may support a more modest weight loss of up to - % Lifestyle Advise patients that a multi-component intervention (diet + physical activity + B (EL ++ to +) behaviour) may be effective in the medium-term (up to months) for modest weight loss, but weight loss may not be maintained in the longer-term (> months). Advise patients that dietary approaches alone that create an energy deficit of - C (EL +) , kcals\/day may be effective in the short-term for modest weight loss (up to months). Only recommend very low energy diets (VLEDs) of < kcals\/day if the patient will C (EL +) have access to intensive dietary support and if the patient presents with immediate risk of worsening papilloedema. Pharmacotherapy Acetazolamide in conjunction with a multi-component lifestyle intervention may B (EL +) support weight management, however this may be due side-effects of the medication which can cause dysgeusia. Metformin in conjunction with a multi-component lifestyle intervention in patients C (EL +) with IIH and PCOS may support weight management. GLP- RA licensed for weight management may be useful in immediate GPP management of IIH requiring weight loss, however cessation of GLP- RA is demonstrated to result in weight regain and therefore should be considered a long- term intervention. If GLP- RA is only prescribed short-term, patients should be counselled that weight regain is likely once the medication is stopped. Topiramate prescribed for IIH may result in weight loss due to side-effects appetite GPP reduction, however this should not be prescribed solely for the purpose of weight loss Bariatric surgery Copyright For women living with IIH and a BMI > kg\/m , bariatric surgery should be A (EL ++) considered. For men living with IIH and a BMI > kg\/m , bariatric surgery should be considered GPP When considering selection of bariatric surgical procedure, a gastric bypass or C (EL - to ) sleeve gastrectomy may be preferential Bariatric surgery may be considered as an early intervention for IIH as ICP has C (EL ++) been demonstrated to reduce at weeks following the procedure Patients with active IIH may warrant priority referral for bariatric surgery given the GPP importance of weight loss and maintenance in the disease A multi-disciplinary assessment of patient suitability for bariatric surgery should be GPP undertaken by a bariatric specialist unit EL = evidence level, GPP = Good Practice Point Copyright Figure: PRISMA flowchart Copyright Weight Management Interventions for Adults With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Practice Recommendations Sally Abbott, Fiona Chan, Abd A Tahrani, et al.
