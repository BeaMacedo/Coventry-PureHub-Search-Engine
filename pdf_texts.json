read agement services or services that are commissioned by local health with sadness about the recent closure of one such local authority authorities Since the responsibility for commissioning sits with ICSs this commissioned service which has been held in high regard both nation is likely to represent a small proportion of services A further limitation ally and locally by the patients it

the unantic the commissioning of bariatric surgery and weight management services ipated findings was that one ICS that does not commission a Tier in England and thus we welcome further collaboration

such cir The current work highlights significant inequity with access to cumstances service providers outside the ICS are not obliged to accept effective treatment whether that be geographically or by locally This is an important point about the provision and funding of care for applied none evidence based restrictive criteria for bariatric surgery patients with obesity across different ICSs and if accepted should At the centre of this issue are people living with obesity unable to prompt ICSs to ensure local services are commissioned Current waiting access care many of whom have progressive

treatment is shifting from weight loss to patients health and quality of life The objective of this study was to select a core set of patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures to be used in clinical obesity care Materials and Methods The Standardizing Quality of Life in Obesity Treatment III face to face hybrid consensus meeting including people living with obesity as well as healthcare providers was held in Maastricht the Netherlands in It was preceded by two prior multinational consensus meetings and a systematic review Results The meeting was attended by participants representing twelve countries from five continents The participants included healthcare providers such as surgeons endocrinologists dietitians psychologists researchers and people living with obesity most of whom were involved in patient representative networks Three patient reported outcome measures patient reported outcomes were selected the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Lite self esteem measure the BODY Q physical function physical symptoms psychological function social function eating behavior and body image and the Quality of Life for Obesity Surgery questionnaire excess skin No patient reported outcome measure was selected for stigma Conclusion A core set of patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures for measuring quality of life in clinical obesity care is established incorporating patients and experts opinions This set should be used as a minimum for measuring quality of life in routine clinical practice It is essential that individual patient reported outcome measure scores are shared with people living with obesity in order to enhance patient engagement and shared decision making Key points Eight patient reported outcomes PROs were selected for inclusion in the core set The BODY Q IWQOL Lite and QOLOS were selected to measure eight core PROs These PROs and PRO measures represent the outcomes that matter most to patients and experts These outcomes must be considered when measuring treatment effects in obesity treatment Extended author information available on the last page of the article Vol Obesity Surgery Graphical

significantly from those used in registries A number can be used in different cultural and geographical settings Spe of healthcare providers suggested that some PROMs could be cifically these PROMs are available in and languages omitted from the core set and that others contained too many respectively No PROM was selected to measure stigma questions between seven and ten per PRO By omitting these because the available PROMs were considered unsuitable To the PROMs feasibility might be enhanced and less time would best of our knowledge this is the first multinational and multidis be needed to complete the questionnaires According to the ciplinary effort in obesity treatment to achieve the goal of stand participants living with obesity at the meeting omission was ardizing the quality of life outcomes that matter most to patients not necessary They did not consider completing multiple The primary objective of the core set is to improve the quality of questionnaires as burdensome provided their purpose was care in obesity treatment by reflecting outcomes that are most explained and feedback was provided important to patients To this end we incorporated the extensive Using PROMs in clinical practice is increasingly becoming input of people living with obesity throughout the development of routine In the treatment of cancer for example PROMs are the set The core set represents the selection of PROMs that should used to monitor symptoms and quality of life during the pre minimally be used in clinical obesity care operative and postoperative periods Their administration The same PROs and PROMs were selected for the clinical and interpretation led to better identification of posttreatment practice core set as for the research core set which allows the symptoms and problems enhanced clinical decision making same set to be used for different purposes The PROs mostly processes and improved communication between patients and align with the findings of Coulman et al They identified healthcare providers The ability of PROMs to improve out eight themes with regard to living with the outcomes of meta comes in cancer care was further illustrated by Basch et al bolic and bariatric surgery Despite frequent use of the SF They reported that in comparison to usual care digital symp in prior obesity treatment research it was not included in the tom monitoring using PROMs significantly improves physical core set as participants favored other PROMs based on face function symptom control and overall quality of life There is validity In a recent validation study by de Vries et al even evidence that PROMs can improve survival in cancer care the SF was not supported by sufficient validation evidence In obesity treatment PROM data offer a unique oppor in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery due to tunity to enrich consultations by redirecting the focus to those the irrelevance of some questions and lack of relevant items aspects that concern patients most or problems that would oth to patients among other reasons aligning with the cur erwise go undetected Sharing PROM data facilitates active rent findings Recently

Obesity Related Problem Scale high quality care To further aid implementation of the OP scale and Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life PROMs in clinical practice we developed a user manual for the Instrument OWQOL for inclusion The S Q O T consensus core set Appendix Table meetings took a different approach to selecting PROMs by Despite the benefits of PROMs there are challenges regard focusing on their suitability for the selected PRO domains ing their implementation First the participants living with Obesity Surgery obesity indicated that the lack of feedback on PROM scores was only this is unlikely to have biased our results Fourth not all what withheld them most from routinely completing PROMs online participants participated in the entire two day meeting We concluded that PROMs should only be implemented in clin either as a consequence of the different time zones or because of ical practice if the scores are shared with the patients To facili the multiple meetings that were planned prior to the combined tate this process a digital platform is required that automatically congress of the European Association on the Study of Obesity dispatches PROMs before consultations and

Determining a MCID for the globally Ideally this set of PROs and PROMs should be comple QOLOS will also be necessary mented by a set of clinical outcomes that form a core outcome set The key strength of our study was that we involved a geo for obesity treatment graphically diverse panel of healthcare providers from different disciplines as well as participants living with obesity most of whom were

impact of a healthy weight body mass index BMI at disease Accepted April presentation is not known This study aimed to evaluate the visual and headache outcomes stratified by the presenting BMI This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study IIH Life based KEYWORDS on a tertiary neuro ophthalmology IIH service University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust United Pseudotumor cerebri vision Kingdom recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between and Those with headache prognosis weight a presenting BMI were included The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR OCT imaging papilloedema visual acuity Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation PMD optical coherence tomo graphy OCT measurements and headache outcomes of frequency severity and Headache Impact Test score Three hundred seventy five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI About of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and BMI kg m The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity however OCT papilloe dema measures were similar The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients BMI at presentation does not appear to influence long term visual or headache outcomes Introduction kg m which is reduced to kg m in some ethnic groups due to increased cardiometabolic Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH pre risk at a lower BMI dominantly affects reproductive aged females The adiposity associated with IIH is with obesity IIH is a disease of raised intra centripetal and is correlated with lumbar cranial pressure which can lead to chronic puncture opening pressure A two fold headaches visual loss and cognitive increase in cardiovascular disease risk has been dysfunction Atypical IIH is a term given to

presenta that baseline BMI did not impact the trajectory of tion is uncommon The visual outcomes are similar visual or headache outcomes while for some this between BMI groups however the improvement in could be reassuring it is important to actively man papilloedema was observed to be more rapid in age those who do not have obesity patients without obesity The headache frequency The only current disease modifying therapy for was higher in IIH patients with obesity as compared the systemic manifestations of IIH is weight to those without and over time the headache out loss Its role in patients with a normal base comes were similar between BMI groups line BMI is not yet understood This would be The prevalence of a healthy weight BMI in this a useful future analysis as a recent analysis of IIH study is similar to a previous large study of IIH In Life database found that a change in BMI was this cohort those with a healthy weight BMI includ a prognostic marker for visual outcomes In other ing those without obesity had worse visual field scenarios such as pregnancy the role of weight loss function at baseline despite similar OCT papilloe is not clear dema measures This could potentially reflect a delay Although the outcomes based on BMI are similar in diagnosis due to a lower suspicion of IIH in for people living with IIH it should not be con a person with a healthy weight BMI The OCT cluded that the underlying pathogenesis is the same imaging measures have been shown to be a more IIH has been shown to be associated with hypertes acute marker of disease activity as well as a better tosteronism independent of obesity with meta correlation to intracranial pressure than clinical bolic priming towards lipogenesis In people symptoms Thus the comparable OCT mea with obesity significant weight loss of body sures with worse PMD may indicate a delayed pre weight is often required for disease remission sentation of the disease The trend seen in CSF Potential pathogenesis in lean IIH could be inferred diversion surgery rates may reflect that patients from the phenotypically similar condition of poly with a higher BMI are more likely to present in cystic ovarian syndrome PCOS In PCOS one fulminant IIH and thus require surgery although study reported that of the patients had this requires further evaluation in other cohorts as a healthy weight BMI defined as BMI kg was not statistically significant in this cohort m with a significantly lower prevalence in lean A statistically significant difference was seen in the PCOS of deranged lipid profiles impaired glucose visual acuity and macular ganglion cell layer volume tolerance test and insulin resistance The treat trajectories between those with obesity and those ment for insulin resistance with metformin has been without Table However the clinical significance shown to lessen hyperandrogenism in PCOS and is uncertain due to the small magnitude of this has also been shown to potentially be of benefit in variation which is likely not be perceivable by the IIH A limitation of the IIH life database is that patient or of clinical significance metformin use is not routinely documented and The trajectories of the headache outcomes were therefore no further analysis could be done In not significantly different between kg m and IIH with a normal baseline BMI there may be kg m This is consistent in that baseline BMI a role for dietary modifications and pharmacother potentially and has a greater influence on visual apy to avoid future weight gain as this has been outcomes

undertake an up to date review of the current literature to formulate practical and evidence based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH to recommend future avenues for research in this condition Method A scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders Outcome We make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH including criteria for diagnosis and recognition as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored Plain English summary Post bariatric hypoglycaemia PBH is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery In this condition people develop low blood sugar occurring about h after meals leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger sweating anxiety palpitations and even blackouts and fainting PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow up after their surgery which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non specialist healthcare centres The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care To address this problem the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss and hormone specialists Keywords obesity bariatric surgery post bariatric hypoglycaemia late dumping Introduction Bariatric surgery such as Roux en Y gastric bypass As a result it is important to identify diagnose and gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy carries adequately treat PBH in people who have undergone significant metabolic benefits including weight loss bariatric surgery diabetes remission and reduction of macrovascular and microvascular events As a result of this clinical Aims and objectives evidence bariatric surgery is more often considered as an option for the treatment of obesity and diabetes The aim of this guideline is to improve and standardise as well as for other metabolic complications such clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of as non alcoholic fatty liver disease Given the PBH To this end our objectives were to undertake an increasing prevalence of bariatric surgery clinicians are up to date review of the current literature formulate increasingly encountering complications of surgery practical and evidence based guidance regarding the One such complication is post bariatric hypoglycaemia diagnosis and treatment of PBH and recommend PBH PBH is usually defined as post prandial future avenues for research in this

identify the relevant literature The which occurs within minutes of food ingestion initial working group contributed to search terms with Early dumping is characterised by a combination of the search

submission for publication Further diagnostic methods criteria see below It is estimated information and clarification were added with the to be between and based on continuous glucose assistance of BK TT and CBL after peer review monitoring studies following provocative tests and using hypoglycaemia related events Registry based studies report a far lower prevalence of Pathophysiology of PBH following bariatric surgery The exact pathophysiology of PBH is unknown but the dynamic interaction of food absorption incretin and Risk factors for PBH insulin secretion is thought to play a role Following most types of bariatric surgery with the exception of Currently there are contrasting reports regarding the gastric banding there is a rapid transit of nutrients to risk factors for PBH Some observational studies have the jejunum and the ileum with absorption and a rapid suggested that people who develop PBH are non diabetic peak of glucose which provokes insulin secretion The pre operatively and have lower pre operative HbA c This exposure of L cells in the distal jejunum and proximal phenomenon is possibly related to higher pre operative ileum to these nutrients also provokes the secretion \u03b2 cell function insulin secretion and sensitivity of GLP and other incretins which amplify the Indeed the presence of pre operative hypoglycaemia hyperglycaemia dependent secretion of insulin and during an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT is associated the insulin dependent disposal of glucose A leading with PBH Other possible risk factors are younger theory is that some people

these differential diagnoses is outside the scope of this gastric bypass SAGB also known as one anastomosis or guidance but internationally accepted guidance for mini gastric bypass has not been studied systematically this is available PBH should also be distinguished with conflicting data Two surgical series reported no from idiopathic postprandial syndrome which is the hypoglycaemia whereas

Table and pasireotide appear to be effective at preventing hypoglycaemia following OGTT or MMT IM long acting pasireotide is also effective although Somatostatin analogues SC pasireotide three times a day may be more effective than long acting IM pasireotide With regard to Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide lanreotide lanreotide there is no published experience on this and pasireotide have been used in individuals with medication for PBH although the experience with this dumping syndrome following upper gastrointestinal analogue in dumping syndrome suggested no difference surgery such as gastrectomy and peptic ulcer surgery in late dumping symptom scores for many years They have been found to be effective for both for early and late dumping syndromes with In summary there is evidence to suggest that short acting late dumping syndrome being the analogous condition SC octreotide and pasireotide can prevent PBH when to PBH in individuals undergoing upper GI surgery such given three times a day with meals Recommendation as oesophagectomy or gastrectomy Table IM pasireotide LAR is also effective These are thought to work by activating somatostatin Recommendation Table However less evidence receptors particularly subtypes and and inhibiting for efficacy exists for other long acting preparations and the release of various gut and metabolic hormones these are not presently recommended Recommendation such as gastrin pancreatic polypeptide glucagon Table neurotensin secretin GLP and insulin all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dumping syndrome There are relative differences in activity SGLT inhibitors between the presently available somatostatin analogues In humans the sodium glucose linked transporters octreotide lanreotide and pasireotide Both octreotide SGLT and SGLT play an important role in sodium and and lanreotide exhibit greater activity at subtype than glucose transport across the basal brush membrane of subtype whereas pasireotide activates both subtypes gut and kidney cells SGLT is expressed in the enterocyte and The more marked hyperglycaemic effect from and in enteroendocrine cells L cells and K cells which pasireotide relative to octreotide in non bariatric respectively produce the incretins GLP and GIP surgery individuals is due to the relative ratio of SGLT is responsible for glucose absorption in the small subtype activation Both pasireotide and octreotide intestine and for the reabsorption of approximately are able to suppress insulin secretion but pasireotide is of the filtered glucose load in segment of the less able to suppress glucagon secretion than octreotide renal proximal tubule SGLT is primarily expressed explained by the fact that inhibition of insulin secretion in the kidney and is responsible for the reabsorption in human pancreatic islets is mediated by subtypes of approximately of the filtered glucose load in the and while inhibition of glucagon secretion is

SGLT use of SGLT inhibitors for PBH Recommendation Canagliflozin when given to individuals who had Table undergone RYGB led to a delay in glucose absorption and reduced peak glucose in response to a g OGTT There was no significant reduction in nadir glucose albeit there was no evidence of PBH in this group Other treatments This was accompanied by a reduction in peak GLP Diazoxide is a potassium

advice professionals HCPs are well placed to participate in semi structured discuss child excess weight with parents and HCP knowledge and skills for interviews SNs from a community and support them to make changes example enhancing HCPs general healthcare NHS trust were recruited to However HCPs have concerns about and weight management related participate in focus groups Vignettes addressing this issue There is a need to were used to stimulate discussion skills and knowledge of child weight understand the factors that influence Data were analysed guided by the management services HCPs in initiating these conversations to Framework approach Conclusion inform strategies to support them Results A range of barriers exist to HCPs Aim Thirteen GPs seven PNs and SNs addressing child excess weight To explore with HCPs working participated The following three with parents in primary care and in primary care and community themes were identified regarding community settings Actions to effect settings their experiences of having barriers to HCPs having conversations structural changes and support HCPs conversations about child weight with about child excess weight structural in developing relevant knowledge and parents and the factors that create and organisational HCP related and skills are required to overcome these barriers or facilitate them to have these parent or

working research school nursing Introduction the support of other agencies There has and years Currently these been less research that more directly data cannot be routinely accessed in There has been increasing focus on the informs the strategies and a lack of primary care but there is an aspiration role of GPs and other primary care and guidance on the support required to to provide this access in the future community healthcare professionals facilitate HCPs in having conversations communication from Public Health HCPs in health promotion including about child weight with parents In a

Digital Child factors that HCPs found helpful when about initiating conversations with Health programme which could assist discussing child weight were identified parents about their child s weight Two in supporting HCPs to have conversations These factors mainly related to systematic reviews of qualitative studies about child weight approaches to interacting with families conducted with HCPs in high income and tools to assess child weight countries reported barriers to HCPs This study explored GPs primary having these conversations including In England there is a programme of care nurses PNs

The use of BMI centiles by HCPs to feel confident in raising the issue and this the child is a little overweight or not but assess overweight was identified as an was sometimes related to the HCP

and parental separation may the limited training that the HCPs receive making dedicated appointments to make them more reluctant to address on childhood obesity and nutrition which discuss child excess weight There was a child overweight contributed to reluctance to initiate sense that this also gave parents time to conversations about child weight prepare for the conversation I think it s quite difficult to talk about weight when they ve the family got so And I think it s a problem that lots of It discussion about child weight requires people would like to tackle but they just much going on SN FG discussing more than the extra thirty seconds I have don t really know where to start we vignette at the end of the ten minute consultation don t have much in the way of training Sometimes I will get over that by saying SNs particularly saw the feedback letter about childhood nutrition GP I think we need to discuss your child s that parents of children with overweight general health please book a separate Parent or family related HCPs and or obesity receive following NCMP appointment to do that GP identified that parents often do not measurement as an issue The SNs had

following receipt of the feedback a barrier In some cases HCPs discussed to the integration of data systems letter and discussed that the wording this in the context of ethnic and cultural to enable HCPs to access and share was problematic often causing anger and factors health information and measurements distress for children with other healthcare I think in this population the issue is that I

rapidly gaining weight interviewing and to providing child she actually didn t know how to cook the weight management and healthy eating it s all this collaborative working isn t it dinners and yeah we spent a lot of time advice Many participants felt that more It ll stop doing the work twice and also with her giving her worksheets how to cook training on providing this advice would it s about being on the same page as well make potato and beans rather than going to help them address child weight Some because a parent may come to us and say the fish and chip shop SN FG also commented on the need to consider I don t know what the problem is and we different cultural contexts when providing it s kind of addressing it in the sense of can say Well actually let s have a look at healthy eating

actually believe as well is sharing advice for families would assist them in GP discussing vignette the experiences as well like you say I did opportunistically addressing child excess this with that one SN FG weight if you want it done GPs to have conversations with parents about child I think an information package to be able Discussion excess weight you have to attach to give to a parent would be great I some kind of incentive for all GPs to take think from a healthcare professional point Summary it seriously unfortunately But at the of view is to give them something to put same time I think there runs the risk of it GPs PNs and SNs recognised the in their hands that they will sit and look at becoming a tick box exercise to get that importance of having conversations when they ve got five minutes PN payment GP with parents about child excess weight but they experienced several barriers HCP knowledge and skills The need HCP approaches HCPs identified While some related to

training on primary and community care The study available to them if you know what the giving this advice would further facilitate has provided valuable new insights on services are that are out there then it makes them having these conversations see facilitating factors for HCPs particularly the conversation a lot easier GP HCP knowledge and skills Many HCPs around structural aspects of health care recognised the need to involve the whole and supporting the development of HCPs When asked about skills and training family when providing this advice knowledge and skills as previous research participants identified generic HCP has focused on facilitators relating to I would relate it to the problem that they skills that were helpful to them in HCP parent interactions presented

address discussions inadequate time fear of weight in primary school aged children undermining parental trust lack of interpreters and financial incentivisation were included Participants serving recognition of overweight and cultural However the need for a more joined up socioeconomically disadvantaged and perceptions of weight by parents approach across healthcare organisations ethnically

gastroplasty ESG is a minimally invasive procedure that has been demonstrated in the MERIT randomised controlled trial to result in substantial and durable additional weight loss in adults with obesity compared with lifestyle fi fi modi cation LM alone We sought to conduct the rst cost effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with class II obesity BMI kg m from a national healthcare system perspective in England based on results from this study METHODS A state Markov model was developed comprising BMI based health states and an absorbing death state Baseline characteristics utilities and transition probabilities were informed by patient level data from the subset of patients with class II obesity in MERIT Adverse events AEs were based on the MERIT safety population Mortality was estimated by applying BMI fi speci c hazard ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from the literature disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I III obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data Disutility due to AEs and the prevalence of obesity related comorbidities were based on the literature Costs included intervention costs AE costs and comorbidity costs RESULTS ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an increase in quality adjusted life years QALYs The incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER for ESG vs LM alone was QALY gained ESG was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses with no ICER estimate exceeding QALY gained In probabilistic sensitivity analysis the mean ICER was QALY gained and ESG remained cost effective in of iterations at a willingness to pay threshold of QALY CONCLUSION Our study indicates that ESG is highly cost effective versus LM alone for the treatment of adults with class II obesity in England International Journal of Obesity

Handling Editor Statement Submitted and externally peer reviewed The handling editor was Associate Editor Rebecca Burch MD Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Abstract Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH is associated with obesity however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss reduction in intracranial pressure benefit to visual and headache outcomes quality of life and mental health Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO CRD MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant th literature published from inception until December Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN methodology Results A total of studies were included Bariatric surgery resulted in kg weight loss at months Level to Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between to kg weight loss Level to Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP cm H O at months Level followed by multi component lifestyle intervention acetazolamide cm H O at months Level and then a very low energy diet intervention cm H O at months Level The least ICP reduction was shown at months after completing a month multi component lifestyle intervention cm H O Level Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP Level to Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI kg m since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management Grade A A multi component lifestyle intervention diet physical activity behaviour had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI kg m Grade B Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH is characterized by raised intracranial pressure ICP pulse synchronous tinnitus headaches and papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss Most people living with IIH are also living with obesity Population studies have observed the increased incidence of IIH in those with an increased body mass index BMI and an elevated BMI is shown to be directly associated with greater risk of a diagnosis of IIH Furthermore a relationship between BMI and visual outcomes has been established A study found patients with BMI kg m were more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro ophthalmology visit and every kg m increase in BMI increased the odds of severe visual loss by times IIH is emerging from being a disease of the neuro ophthalmic axis to being a distinct metabolic disease where the underlying pathophysiology may be modified by weight loss Moreover IIH has been demonstrated to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promotes further weight gain At the same time psychiatric disorders are sevenfold more common in people with IIH compared to the general population which may result from common biological pathways related to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal cortex HPA axis dysfunction which may mean weight management is more challenging for people living with IIH Obesity results from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factors and there is a strong genetic component underlying interindividual variation in body weight As a result the human body is biologically hard wired to prevent weight loss This is a challenge for the treatment of IIH since excess body weight has an impact on IIH development and improvement Moderate weight gain of is associated with a greater risk of developing IIH among both people with and without obesity Meanwhile weight loss in the range of has been reported to lead to remission and weight re gain has been found to be a risk factor for disease recurrence Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Sustained weight loss therefore is essential for long term remission of the disease However clinical practice is varied in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategies for IIH Indeed sustained weight loss has been demonstrated to be essential for long term remission of the disease The optimal weight loss method for IIH is yet to be determined especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity Hence the aim of this study was to identify evaluate and summarise the relevant published studies relating to weight loss interventions for IIH in terms of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcomes such as vision and headache A second aim of the study was to convene a panel of experts in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice points to help guide clinicians who may not have formal training in weight management Methods This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identifier CRD and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses PRISMA guidelines Search strategy th The databases MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception up to December via EBSCO using a comprehensive search strategy eAppendix which was tested and refined to maximise sensitivity for retrieving relevant studies There were no language restrictions The Boolean operator OR was used to separate each term within each concept and each concept was concatenated by the operator AND When possible Medical Subject Heading MeSH terms were used to expand the search language The search strategy was identical in both databases with minor adaptation to the coding to suit Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology individual database settings References were imported into Covidence software for de duplication and screening Inclusion and exclusion criteria For studies to be included the study population criteria were aged years old diagnosed with IIH and with a baseline BMI kg m Studies were included if a weight management intervention was provided and weight change between pre and post intervention was reported Reviews expert opinions case reports and conference proceedings were excluded Papers selection and data extraction Two reviewers SA and SPM independently and in duplicate screened titles and abstracts and then screened full text reports for all identified studies Reviewers were masked to each other s responses until each screening stage was complete utilising Covidence Disagreement was resolved by consensus between reviewers Data extraction Study characteristics were documented and the criteria to which the participants were diagnosed with IIH were recorded The primary outcome of interest in this systematic review was weight change measured either by absolute weight kg or excess weight calculated by absolute weight loss baseline weight ideal body weight x or absolute BMI kg m change The secondary outcomes were changes in ICP visual and headache outcomes and self reported quality of life measures e g Short Form SF Health Survey Specifically for visual outcomes we documented visual acuity visual field type and output papilloedema and whether it was subjectively graded or quantified by optic coherence tomography OCT imaging Headache outcomes included headache symptoms headache phenotype assessment type Headache impact test HIT headache frequency Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology severity score and analgesic usage Data were extracted by one reviewer SA SPM FCh and peer reviewed by the another SA SPM FCh using an electronic data extraction form Data analysis Since the included studies were diverse heterogeneity between studies in terms of the interventions duration of follow up and method of outcome measurement precluded pooling of results with meta analysis Instead a narrative synthesis approach was employed to synthesise the findings from included studies Quality of evidence The quality and risk of bias of the included studies was assessed at the study level and each study was assigned an evidence level for the weight loss ICP headache and visual outcomes based on Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN methodology eAppendix by two independent reviewers SA and SPM Practice recommendations The process of SIGN methodology eAppendix was followed to formulate evidence based clinical recommendations A multi disciplinary recommendation panel was formed of relevant professional groups with experience and expertise in IIH and weight management The recommendation panel included a dietitian SA clinical psychologist FCa endocrinologist AAT bariatric surgeons DJP CP neurologists AJS FCh neuro ophthalmologists SPM SW and a patient representative AD The expert panel convened to discuss the evidence base identified from the systematic review and formulate draft recommendations The draft recommendations together with their grading were circulated within the guideline group in an iterative process until consensus was achieved Where an evidence base was lacking Good Practice Points GPP were formulated to provide clinicians with short pieces of advice that the recommendation panel deemed were essential to good clinical practice Copyright The

with IIH based upon the evidence identified within the systematic review and graded according to the quality of available evidence Where evidence was not available for IIH populations GPP were formulated based upon evidence extrapolated from obesity literature The graded recommendations are shown in Table Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Discussion The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people living with IIH is not only because weight loss reduces ICP but also that it reduces mortality and reduces the burden of prevalent and incident obesity related complications Weight loss is recognised as a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH This study sought to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH which was identified as research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership The panel made graded recommendations based upon the evidence identified by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in good practice points from the obesity literature Table While there was one RCT demonstrating Level evidence for the directed use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to months and one cross over study Level utilising a VLED for months which demonstrated efficacy in terms of ICP visual and headache outcomes these two studies have not been replicated The results of this analysis therefore demonstrated the shortage of high quality evidence as there were no studies that could be directly compared due to different weight management methods being used and a lack of standardised outcome measures Sustained long term weight loss should be considered as a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patients with IIH Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counselled sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH They should have their weight measured and BMI calculated to assess the weight management options and monitor the intervention efficacy Although there are no RCTs that evaluated the measurement of overweight and obesity compared to not measuring these outcomes the panel agreed that this aspect of IIH patient care was essential The degree of weight loss required for IIH symptom improvement was less clear as studies reported amount of weight lost with a variety of outcome measures There were no studies Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology evaluating the time where the minimum amount of weight lost was correlated with the point of disease remission There was Level evidence that demonstrated a reduction of weight between was required to achieve disease remission In the VLED cross over study of body weight loss was correlated with reduction in ICP resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcomes and the IIHWT disease remission was defined as ICP to return to normal levels at cmH It is therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle interventions delivered in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss required to induce remission of IIH The panel considered this evidence and recommended the target weight loss should be for IIH disease remission However the panel acknowledged that this goal is unlikely to be achieved via a lifestyle intervention alone and a realistic goal may be weight loss which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptoms There were no studies evaluating solely physical activity interventions in IIH Physical activity could be recommended as part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss Behaviour therapy has been shown to be a useful adjunct when incorporated into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance Licensed anti obesity medications AOMs did not feature in this study as there were no studies with primary aims of using pharmacotherapy for weight loss in IIH It was noteworthy that there was inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide and topiramate and to a lesser extent zonisamide are used to manage IIH and have previously been clinical observed to reduce weight The method by which acetazolamide causes weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia a salty rancid or metallic taste sensation that persists in the mouth nausea dyspepsia vomiting and diarrhoea Acetazolamide is not well tolerated in this patient group with up to of people discontinuing the medicine In our systematic review it was interesting to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and ICP at months following the directed use of acetazolamide Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Bariatric surgery had the greatest sustained weight loss up to months Clinicians managing IIH may be reluctant to refer patients for bariatric surgery due to funding access and misconceptions regarding the safety of bariatric surgery such as operative mortality excess skin and nutritional optic atrophy Physicians may be concerned about CSF shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery however bariatric surgery has been shown to be safer and more cost effective than CSF shunting Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedures were superior to gastric banding in terms of weight loss and ICP reduction in people with IIH For obesity gastric bypass has been found to be the most clinically effective and most cost effective intervention compared to other weight management programmes and has the highest quality adjusted life year QALY gains Superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in IIH may be explained by the enhanced postprandial glucagon like peptide GLP secretion as emerging data found that exogenously administered GLP significantly reduces ICP without weight loss Another key consideration when understanding the impact of an intervention is the natural history of the disease including disease duration This could have an impact on outcomes for example in people who have had the disease for many years it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that has occurred due to axonal loss and hence why in studies with long disease duration the visual field measures may not improve Likewise papilloedema may acutely be present and without intervention may regress to the mean Strengths of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review which was prospectively registered on PROSPERO and all screening data extraction and quality assessment was blinded and conducted by two reviewers The evidence was translated into clinical recommendations which were made by multi disciplinary experts in obesity and IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology hence supporting the translation of the research for clinical application There are certain limitations to the study The included studies all used different outcome measures and a variety of weight loss methods This meant a meta analysis was not able to be performed due to study heterogeneity This heterogeneity in IIH studies evaluating weight loss methods needs to be considered when planning future clinical trials in IIH We also only included published studies which means there was potential for publication bias As meta analysis was precluded it was not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias using funnel plot The study populations of our included studies were predominately female a reflection of IIH being less prevalent in males however the findings are therefore not generalisable to males Specifically there is a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in IIH in a male population and for both genders at a lower BMI of kg m None of the studies included women who were pregnant which is an area in need of evaluating as it has been recommended that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input Most of the studies were of short duration with only one study reporting outcomes longitudinally at years The longer the reporting period the more missing data occurred However future studies should be encouraged to include long term outcomes to determine cost effectiveness and intervention durability People with IIH who have obesity compared to healthy weight have significantly lower health related quality of life scores Moreover obesity and weight gain have been found to be independent predictors of poorer mental health related quality of life Psychiatric symptoms in association with IIH are usually poorly described and underestimated in the literature but the prevalence is reported to be as high as Given that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patients engagement and adherence to weight management interventions and indeed IIH treatments this requires investigation Hence future studies should collect quality of life and Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology psychiatric outcome measures to evaluate the influence of weight management interventions and include long term outcome data collection to assess durability of the intervention Conclusions We advocate for obesity to be viewed as a chronic disease with complex contributory associations and prognostic implications to IIH rather than merely a risk factor Weight loss should be seen as an important tool in the management of IIH The biological drivers of obesity may explain why short term weight management interventions are often insufficient for long term disease remission The hierarchy of effect in weight loss methods seem to be analogous to the reduction of ICP with bariatric surgery having the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the IIH population However not all patients will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention In such case multi component lifestyle interventions should be provided but it should be acknowledged that weight loss is likely to be modest and IIH disease remission is therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in IIH symptoms WNL eapp http links lww com WNL D WNL eapp http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D

study Setting referral level hospitals across the six geopolitical regions of Nigeria Population Pregnant women who were diagnosed with obstructed labour during childbirth and subsequently underwent an emergency caesarean section between September and August Methods Secondary analysis of routine maternity care datasets Random effects multivariable logistic regression was used to ascertain the factors associated with obstructed labour Main outcome measures Risk factors for obstructed labour and related postpartum complications including intrapartum stillbirth maternal death uterine rupture postpartum haemorrhage and sepsis Results Obstructed labour was diagnosed in women Among these women resulted in maternal death and experienced postpartum complications Women under years of age OR CI those who lacked formal education OR CI were unemployed OR CI nulliparous OR CI did not receive antenatal care OR CI or received antenatal care in an informal healthcare setting OR CI were more likely to experience obstructed labour Ineffective referral systems were identified as a major contributor to maternal death Conclusions Modifiable factors contributing to the prevalence of obstructed labour and associated adverse outcomes in Nigeria can be addressed through targeted policies and clinical interventions Tweetable abstract Obstructed labour affects of labours in referral level facilities across Nigeria Improving referral pathways will reduce morbidity associated with obstructed labor BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology Page of Introduction Obstructed labour also referred to as labour dystocia is a condition in which the progression of labour is hindered by a mismatch between the size of the presenting part of the fetus and the woman s pelvis despite the presence of adequate uterine contractions This often occurs because of the disparity between the fetal presenting part and the maternal pelvis Globally obstructed labour affects approximately of pregnancies and accounts for substantial long term complications such as vesicovaginal fistula and of maternal deaths In low and middle income countries including Nigeria obstructed labour continues to be a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality For instance a recent national cross sectional study of maternal near misses found that uterine rupture resulting from obstructed labour accounted for of severe maternal outcomes and of maternal deaths in Nigeria Due to widespread poverty and poor nutrition in low resource settings such as Nigeria many women have a poorly developed pelvis which is a risk factor for obstructed labour Furthermore Many pregnant women in Nigeria give birth at home without the assistance of skilled professionals When complications arise during delivery the lack of an effective referral system makes it challenging for women to receive prompt medical attention resulting in severe consequences such as uterine rupture maternal death and long term disabilities like vesicovaginal fistula gynaetresia and secondary infertility in those who survive Additionally newborns may experience complications such as stillbirth severe birth asphyxia neonatal death cerebral palsy and developmental disabilities Due to the absence of a coordinated maternity care data collection process across the country estimates of obstructed labour and its associated risk factors in Nigeria have primarily been based on data from individual health facilities with varying data collection procedures The current study provides a comprehensive estimate of obstructed labour using the Maternal and Perinatal Database for Quality Equity and Dignity Programme MPD QED from referral hospitals spread across the states and six geopolitical zones of Nigeria This is the first study to report the prevalence and risk factors of obstructed labour using a routinely collected nationwide electronic database in Nigeria The MPD QED Page of BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology harmonised database allows for a systematic examination of the prevalence associated risk factors and outcomes of obstructed labour across a national sample of tertiary facilities The findings of this study will help address the critical gap in knowledge regarding the burden of obstructed labour at referral level health facilities in Nigeria and identify factors that can be targeted to reduce its occurrence and complications METHODS Study design and population This study involved a secondary analysis of the MPD QED database a maternity care dataset routinely collected from referral level hospitals across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria Of these were public hospitals and were private health facilities The MPD QED population comprises women who were admitted to these hospitals between September and August for childbirth or due to postpartum complications arising within days of childbirth The database data collection process and quality assurance procedures have been previously described Briefly the MPD QED Programme uses a custom built District Health Information Software DHIS platform that is employed in the collection of maternity care data from referral hospitals in Nigeria The database records maternal sociodemographic information medical and antenatal care history labour and delivery details the baby s clinical conditions within the first seven days of life and the mother s postpartum observations until hospital discharge days after giving birth or death whichever occurred first Our analysis focused on women who were at least weeks pregnant at the time of delivery and who delivered in the participating in the facilities women who were admitted after birth were not included in the current study population We defined obstructed labour based on clinical diagnosis and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology STROBE guidelines in reporting the study BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology Page of Outcomes of interest The main outcome of interest were prevalence of obstructed labour and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with obstructed labour The secondary outcomes were postpartum complications such as ruptured uterus postpartum haemorrhage sepsis intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay following obstructed labour Other outcomes of interest were adverse perinatal outcomes such as intrapartum stillbirth early neonatal death Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission and the identification of contributing factors for maternal death Covariates In our analysis we considered various variables from the dataset known to influence pregnancy outcomes These were classified into three categories sociodemographic factors maternal age marital status level of education occupation and the partner s occupation past medical and obstetric history parity previous caesarean section previous miscarriage and chronic medical conditions and index obstetric history registration for antenatal care referral status from lower levels of care number of gestations pregnancy induced hypertension gestational diabetes antepartum haemorrhage continuous monitoring during labour and birth weight of the child Statistical analysis We described the characteristics of women with and without obstructed labour and the corresponding maternal and perinatal outcomes Mixed effects multilevel logistic models with random intercepts by hospital were constructed to examine the odds of obstructed labour relative to those without obstructed labour Initially a bivariate model was employed to identify associated factors which were subsequently used to build a hierarchical multivariate model The conceptual model proposes that more distant determinants such as sociodemographic characteristics may influence outcomes either directly or indirectly through other proximate determinants such as obstetric history current pregnancy care or complications Therefore three levels were adopted sociodemographic factors past medical and obstetric Page of BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology history and current pregnancy history Model comprised of all sociodemographic variables Model retained statistically significant variables from Model and was further controlled for past medical and obstetric history Similarly Model retained all variables that were statistically significant in Model and further adjusted for index pregnancy history Bivariate and adjusted odds ratios of the final multilevel model along with confidence intervals are presented The level of statistical significance was set at using a sided alternative hypothesis Results Between September and August a total of women were admitted to the referral hospitals for labour Among these had obstructed labour of the women with obstructed labour were referred from lower levels of care The characteristics of the study population are summarised in Table Women who were younger than years of age single lacking formal education and unemployed were more likely to experience obstructed labour Similarly obstructed labour was more prevalent among nulliparous women those without antenatal care those referred from informal healthcare settings and those with a birthweight of grams or more Among the women with obstructed labour had a maternal death and had maternal morbidity Table Postpartum anaemia was the most common morbidity Fifteen women had ruptured uteri had anaemia diagnosed after birth and had postpartum sepsis Approximately of the women were admitted to the intensive care unit and more than half of the women had a hospital stay longer than days after delivery Of the total births were stillbirths Table Of these occurred during labour Among the live births experienced early neonatal death and approximately one third were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with birth asphyxia as the most common indication for admission Birth asphyxia and sepsis were the commonest causes neonatal death Table shows the odds of obstructed labour based on women s characteristics Women who were under years had BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology Page of increased odds of obstructed labour as compared to women over years of age years old aOR CI to years aOR CI lacked formal education aOR CI or had primary education only aOR CI were unemployed aOR CI or had a sales trading job aOR CI and were nulliparous aOR CI or grand multipara aOR CI had increased odds of obstructed labour In addition obstructed labour was associated with a no antenatal care aOR CI or receiving antenatal care in an informal healthcare setting ie traditional birth attendants or other informal setting aOR CI Furthermore fetal macrosomia aOR CI and the absence of continuous labour monitoring aOR CI increased the likelihood of obstructed labour as well as having a chronic medical condition aOR CI The most frequent contributing factors to maternal death among those with obstructed labour were delays in seeking medical assistance delays in appropriate referrals and delays in receiving care from medical staff In addition a lack of necessary equipment or consumables at healthcare facilities was identified as a contributing factor in of cases Table Discussion Main findings We found that around two percent of labours in referral level hospitals in Nigeria were obstructed with most of the women referred Teenagers first time pregnant women women without formal education women who were unemployed women who did not receive antenatal care or received pregnancy care from informal healthcare settings fetal macrosomia and women who were not continuously monitored during labour had increased odds of experiencing obstructed labour Furthermore our study revealed a higher prevalence of maternal death perinatal death and maternal and perinatal morbidity among women Page of BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology with obstructed labour Lack of an effective referral system was identified as the primary contributor to maternal death Strengths and Limitations The strength of this study lies in the involvement of a substantial number of pregnant women and accurate representation of referral level tertiary hospitals across Nigeria s geopolitical regions This study represents the first multi centre estimate of obstructed labour in referral level hospitals across Nigeria based on routinely collected maternity datasets The meticulous analysis and harmonisation of data across hospital sites lends credibility to our findings providing a reliable portrait of the national situation within the highest echelon of healthcare services in Nigeria However this study does have some limitations The diagnosis of obstructed labour was based solely on the clinical assessment made by the attending physician and the subsequent decision to perform a caesarean section We acknowledge that there may be variations in the threshold for diagnosing obstructed labour among clinicians and that some women might have been misdiagnosed or misclassified Interpretation Previous studies conducted in single Nigerian tertiary hospitals have reported a prevalence of obstructed labour ranging from to However our findings which showed a prevalence of for obstructed labour represent referral hospitals across Nigeria The prevalence of obstructed labour and associated maternal morbidity and mortality in this study were lower than population based studies in low to middle income countries This may be due to the focus of this study on referral level hospitals Teenage pregnancy imposes a great physiological burden on young mothers which can be exacerbated by inadequate dietary intake and poor antenatal care This can result in complications during childbirth In addition women who lack formal education may come from families with lower socioeconomic BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology Page of background and may marry earlier before their pelvis is fully developed Teenagers may also have challenges accessing contraception In contrast women who have received formal education are more likely to marry later have greater access to contraception and take advantage of the available antenatal care and hospital delivery services Therefore it is important to provide equitable access to formal education and reduce barriers for young women to education First time mothers are prone to labour anxiety and fetal malpositioning such as occipito posterior head position which can predispose to labour obstruction In the current study on third of women with obstructed labour did not receive antenatal care Women who did not receive antenatal care were three times more likely to experience obstructed labour This underscores the importance of focusing on improving antenatal care attendance as an intervention to prevent prolonged obstructed labour The absence of antenatal care during pregnancy deprives women of vital information regarding her pregnancy such as multiple pregnancies macrosomia fetal anomalies and other risk factors for obstructed labour However it is worth noting that most women who experienced obstructed labour received some form of antenatal care Those who received antenatal care in an informal setting were eight times more likely to experience obstructed labour This is similar to observations in Ethiopia suggesting that the quality of antenatal care is just as crucial The likelihood of obstructed labour increases two fold in women referred Many women seek pregnancy care and delivery at primary or secondary healthcare facilities because of their proximity to their homes and affordability of these services With effective referral pathways in place women who are at risk of obstructed labour can be referred to facilities where caesarean section can be performed however the absence of timely recognition of poor labour progress can result in delays in referring women leading to prolonged obstructed labour Fantu et al also indicated that referral from lower levels of care is a significant risk factor for obstructed labour Women who had macrosomic babies birthweight kg were three times more likely to experience obstructed labour Macrosomia a major cause of cephalopelvic disproportion has been widely recognised Page of BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology as a common contributor to obstructed labour Women can be screened for macrosomia by attending antenatal care allowing for intervention before labour Skilled personnel during labour and continuous labour monitoring to detect failure to progress can also result in early intervention Notably the absence of continuous labour monitoring with a partograph doubled the likelihood of obstructed labour and one third of women with obstructed labour fell into this category Postpartum anaemia was the most prevalent morbidity which aligns with a prior observation from a tertiary health facility in Northern Nigeria This may be attributed to the presence of anaemia prior to pregnancy Many women enter pregnancy with chronic anaemia caused by malnutrition and infections Additionally this finding may also be due to an underestimation of blood loss following surgical intervention for obstructed labour The occurrence of postpartum sepsis may be heightened by factors such as history of anaemia prolonged labour multiple vaginal examinations and surgical interventions The risk of uterine rupture increases with multiparity previous uterine scarring and abnormal fetal lie The prevalence of perinatal morbidity such as birth asphyxia can lead to complications including visual impairment seizure disorders and learning difficulties posing a significant social and economic burden on families the healthcare system and the nation as a whole To improve maternal and perinatal outcomes in Nigeria it is necessary to establish an effective referral system that connects lower level care to tertiary health facilities Moreover enhancing the capacity for emergency obstetric care is crucial Previous research on maternal near misses in Nigeria has revealed that some tertiary hospitals lack the necessary equipment to provide emergency obstetric care In our analysis delays in receiving care after arriving at referral health facilities were found to be contributing factors to maternal death By improving the capacity to provide emergency obstetric services the incidence of adverse outcomes in women with obstructed labour can be reduced Conclusion BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics Gynaecology Page of Obstructed labour is a critical obstetric complication that can result in significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality The results of this study suggest that several interventions can be optimised to improve the quality of care for women with obstructed labour These interventions include increasing access to quality antenatal care ensuring continuous labour monitoring for all women in labour improving referral pathways from lower level facilities and providing improved emergency obstetric care with a focus on preventing sepsis Addressing the underlying contributing factors for obstructed labour such as increasing women s empowerment and autonomy through access to free education requires a multifactorial approach The implementation of these measures can significantly reduce obstructed labour and the associated morbidities and mortality DECLARATIONS Ethics approval and consent to participate The scientific content of the study was approved by the WHO Human Reproduction Programme HRP Research Project Review Panel protocol ID

being considered for type diabetes mellitus T DM prevention This scoping review aims to summarize the literature published to date on CGM and FGM use in adults at risk of T DM Methods A systematic search of four databases CINAHL PsycINFO MEDLINE Cochrane Library was conducted covering studies from to Eligible studies used CGM or FGM in interventional settings targeting adults at risk of T DM Rayyan software facilitated article screening and the Johns Hopkins Evidence Based Practice tool assessed study quality Results From articles studies were included reporting on participants at risk mean age years across eight countries Ten studies employed FGM focusing on health related behaviors diet physical activity or both Significant improvements in glucose control and anthropometrics were reported in and of the studies respectively along with reductions in glycated hemoglobin fasting glucose and insulin resistance Seven studies used qualitative methods with recurrent themes including perceived benefits and motivators for behavior change and acceptability and feasibility of device use Three studies were rated as high level and scored a B for evidence quality while the remaining studies were lower for both level and evidence quality Conclusions Existing published studies deploying glucose monitoring technologies show promise in supporting interventions aimed at preventing T

in the UK As part of a national initiative parents and caregivers are provided information about their child s weight status and invited to attend healthy lifestyle programmes Uptake to these programmes however is low This study investigated the prospective acceptability of a healthy lifestyles programme to help refine a commissioned programme Subject and Methods Parents and caregivers of children aged years were invited to respond to a survey and interviews Responses were coded into domains of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability TFA using deductive thematic analysis Results Data from survey respondents and six interviewees indicated that most participants would be open to attending a healthy lifestyles programme Participants reported high levels of perceived effectiveness and self efficacy Barriers to attendance were identified in the domains of burden opportunity costs and ethicality as well as a lack of information about the format content and target audience of the programme Participants indicated that they would be more likely to enrol if they were aware the programme offered opportunities for social interaction and interactive holistic learning Conclusion Although prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyles programme is high this did not translate to attendance at the programme Using the TFA can inform both the intervention refinement process and how recruitment and marketing of the programme can be supported Provision of more information about the aims content and delivery of the programme and who the target audience is would improve uptake rates Keywords Prospective acceptability healthy lifestyles weight management child overweight child obesity Carrying excess weight in childhood is a serious global public health concern in the UK The global age standardized prevalence of obesity in the years range increased from in to in in girls and from in to in in boys NCD RisC Specifically within Europe childhood

Child Measurement Programme NCMP measuring child height and weight and derived body mass index BMI indicates of children aged were obese in with a further were overweight NCMP At age were obese and overweight NCMP The data further highlights inequalities in prevalence of childhood obesity it has been observed that the prevalence of paediatric obesity is higher among economically disadvantaged

association between obesity and depression OR CI p and more severe depressive symptoms in obese group as compared with normal weight group SMD CI p Quek et al The physical and psychological consequences of childhood obesity represent the individual impact but at a societal level this impact increases healthcare utilisation and subsequently costs to the National Healthcare Service NHS Studies in the United States and the United Kingdom have estimated the total healthcare costs to be around higher for obese adults compared with healthy weight adults Tsai Williamson Glick Wang et al Rudisill et al In the United Kingdom the direct cost of overweight and obesity to the National Health Service NHS is estimated to be in the region of two to three billion pounds a year Rudisill et al There is a lack of data around the direct cost of childhood obesity and healthcare utilisation however in the UK results from a prospective cohort study observing primary care use across years indicated that in comparison to healthy weight counterparts children who were obese at the age of years had significantly higher rates of GP appointments and GP prescriptions in the subsequent years of early childhood Kelly et al They were also more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and sleep apnoea to have higher rates of infections antibiotic prescriptions and accidents The data gathered from this study found the direct primary care costs were higher for obese children a year more in comparison to healthy weight children Kelly et al When this figure was scaled up to predict the cost of primary care use of childhood obesity in England for children aged years of age it estimated that childhood obesity costs around million a year Kelly et al The study only considered primary care use but the findings reiterate the urgency for addressing obesity through early preventative methods which is key priority for public health policy makers with the UK Government s Childhood Obesity Plan Dhsc In of children aged to years in England were obese and were overweight In children aged to years House of Commons Library were obese and were overweight Paediatric obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of psychological and psychiatric consequences negative behavioural tendencies and physical health concerns during childhood Reilly et al Two thirds of children living with obesity at school entry continue to be affected six years later Mead et al Not only are detrimental effects seen during childhood but weight related poor health continues into adulthood with elevated risks of type diabetes heart disease and several cancers observed Biro Wien Lloyd Langley Evans McMullen Reilly et al Serdula et al Singh et al Child weight management is therefore a key priority for public health policy makers with the UK Government s Childhood Obesity Plan aiming to halve child obesity rates by Dhsc The most widely used approach to treating obesity in childhood is lifestyle modification Most interventions have a family focus with parents defined as the agents for change particularly in children under years Family based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and controlling childhood overweight and obesity Ells et al Tomayko et al However parental engagement remains a problem hindering the overall effectiveness and wider implementation of these programmes Family based programmes have a high programme attrition rate of up to Skelton Beech Sallis et al reported that n of parents and caregivers whose child was overweight or obese enrolled on a recommended weight management service and only n attended Even when additional information was provided e g visual body scales and a pre populated enrolment form enrolment into the service only increased to n and attendance rates increased to just Low uptake to such services is a great concern and efforts to better understand barriers and facilitators are needed A systematic review comprised of five quantitative six qualitative and two mixed methods studies appraised the barriers and facilitators to attending community based lifestyle programmes for parents of overweight and obese children Kelleher et al Facilitators included parental concern for children s psychological well being an opportunity for social interaction and a lifestyle focussed approach to weight management Barriers to enrolment included stigma surrounding excess weight parental denial of their child s overweight status and logistics e g travelling distance scheduling conflicts etc Furthermore the family dynamic e g family functioning single or double parent household also affects parental engagement Pratt Skelton It is clear parental engagement with family lifestyle programmes is complex the factors influencing parental engagement are further complicated when considering the participating child Fagg et al identified that children aged participating in a family based weight management program were more likely to drop out if reporting greater psychological distress There are several potential predictors of parent engagement however few comprehensive theoretically driven prospective examinations have been conducted leaving a gap in understanding how to intervene and address parental engagement Spence Skelton Ball In the UK local authorities commission family based programmes that are developed for both parents and children to attend together as per the needs of their communities PHE However low uptake of these programmes continues to remain an issue Upton et al Family based programmes commissioned by local authorities typically emphasise lifestyle and behaviour change using psychological principles Berry et al Knowlden Sharma Mclean et al Sung Chan et al are typically delivered in the community Evaluations of family based community programmes in the UK show that they are effective but continue to be impacted by poor participant engagement both enrolment and completion Upton et a Morawska et al There is also limited exploration of participant engagement from a theoretical lens Burton et al Our study therefore adopts the theoretical framework of acceptability Sekhon et al to explore prospectively parents understanding of a family healthy lifestyle programme There is a high rate of invitation decline which is arguably the first barrier that requires exploration in better understanding poor uptake Dhaliwal et al An overview of Cochrane reviews highlighted much of the process evaluations of family based lifestyle programmes focus on retrospective accounts of how parents children found the lifestyle programme This temporal assessment is limited because it cannot capture reasons for invitation decline nor an understanding of how the programme was initially perceived which could affect decision to join or prioritise attendance at a family programme A prospective account mimics the real world setting in which people need to make choices about engaging with a novel programme Ortblad et al Acceptability is also a crucial but often overlooked factor in determining uptake and ongoing engagement with a healthcare intervention Sekhon et al therefore our study adopts a novel theoretically driven approach to explore prospective acceptability of a healthy lifestyle programme to potential users prior to engagement with it We conducted a mixed methods assessment of prospective acceptability of a healthy lifestyle programme in Warwickshire UK The National Child Measurement Programme NCMP was established by the UK Department of Health to monitor trends in height weight and body mass index of children in reception aged years and again in year aged years in publicly funded UK primary schools PHE Parents and caregivers are usually provided feedback regarding their child s weight status along with signposting to useful resources including the option to self refer to healthy lifestyle programmes although feedback procedures are not a mandated component of the programme so this may vary across regions Dhsc Depending on the local needs i e higher rates of childhood obesity healthy lifestyle programmes can be commissioned and form part of a local authority offering PHE Studies show that parental recognition of their child s weight status increases following NCMP feedback However parents are generally unaware of the associated negative health risks and make minimal changes to lifestyle habits Grimmett et al West et al Even among parents who report intentions to make changes after receiving weight feedback only one in two later report behaviour changes Mooney et al Park et al Unfortunately uptake to services supporting positive changes and a healthy lifestyle is poor and there is a declining rate at which families are referred to weight management programmes Finne et al Perez et al Sallis et al reported that n of parents and caregivers whose child was overweight or obese enrolled on a recommended weight management service and only n attended Even when additional information was provided e g visual body scales and a pre populated enrolment form enrolment into the service only increased to n and attendance rates increased to just Low uptake to such services is a great concern and efforts to better understand barriers and facilitators are needed A systematic review comprised of five quantitative six qualitative and two mixed methods studies appraised the barriers and facilitators to attending community based lifestyle programmes for parents of overweight and obese children Kelleher et al The quantitative and qualitative studies were of moderate to good quality however the two mixed methods studies were both of relatively poor quality either focussing on a non diverse sample O Connor et al or lacking information about sample and methodology Rice et al Facilitators included parental concern for children s psychological well being an opportunity for social interaction and a lifestyle focussed approach to weight management Barriers to enrolment included stigma surrounding excess weight parental denial of their child s overweight status and logistics e g travelling distance scheduling conflicts etc Whilst previous studies have been carried out investigating barriers and facilitators affecting initial and continued attendance of healthy lifestyle programmes acceptability of these programmes remains relatively underexplored Acceptability is a multi faceted construct that reflects the extent to which people delivering or receiving a healthcare intervention consider it to be appropriate based on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the intervention Sekhon Cartwright Francis pg It can be assessed across three temporal perspectives prospective concurrent and retrospective Of these three prospective assessment of intervention acceptability is crucial as it can highlight factors which may influence the acceptability and overall success of an intervention and this assessment can inform refinements to an intervention In contrast to retrospective acceptability assessments which may only assess acceptability among participants who have already chosen to engage with a given intervention prospective acceptability assessments mimics the real world setting in which people need to make choices about engaging with a novel programme Ortblad et al The current study focusses specifically on the assessment of prospective acceptability that is the acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme to potential users prior to engagement with it Methods Study design and ethics This study employed a mixed methods design involving a survey and one to one interviews Ethical approval for this research was obtained from Coventry University s research ethics committee project ID P This study is reported according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research COREQ Tong Sainsbury Craig The healthy lifestyle programme A week healthy lifestyle programme which is free to attend aims to teach families about good nutrition staying active and other healthy living topics The programme is interactive and includes activities such as preparing and tasting food playing games and receiving tips and advice about leading a healthy lifestyle The wider service also offers one to one support and parent carer workshops Following feedback on their child s weight parents and caregivers from Warwickshire are invited to self refer to the service Participants Eligibility criteria Participants were primary caregivers of children in reception aged years through to year aged years and living in Warwickshire a geographical region in England housing residents Participants were required to have sufficient understanding of written or verbal study information provided in English In order to be eligible participants had to be within the catchment area for the healthy lifestyle programme but not yet attended the healthy lifestyle programme We anticipated to speak to the primary caregiver Recruitment Participant recruitment took place between January and April Stakeholders who delivered or commissioned the healthy lifestyle programme held primary responsibility for participant recruitment Coventry University researchers provided study information a link to the Qualtrics survey and contact details to the gatekeepers These gatekeepers disseminated the information directly to potential participants or indirectly through other relevant gatekeepers e g teachers and headteachers via school newsletters and internal communications The study was also advertised via stakeholders websites and social media e g Twitter If participants were interested they were encouraged to share their name and contact details to arrange an interview either via the survey or via direct email to the researcher Participants were clearly informed this was an entirely optional section of the survey Data collection Survey The survey was hosted on Qualtrics Survey Software Participants were given access to a weblink to information about the study and the digital consent form After agreeing with the consent statements participants progressed through the survey questions The survey was estimated to take to minutes to complete Demographic characteristics relating to age group relationship to child ethnicity employment status child s year child s weight status and postcode were collected to characterise the sample A modified version of Sekhon et al s generic TFA based questionnaire was administered to measure prospective acceptability Questions captured intentions in accessing children s measurements intentions to access a healthy lifestyle programme and prospective acceptability of accessing and engaging with a healthy lifestyle programme At the end of the survey participants were presented with a written debrief including signposting to i the healthy lifestyle programme website ii wellbeing resources and iii a link to the interview participant information sheet Interviews Interviews were arranged via email or by telephone A suitable date time and interview medium telephone Microsoft Teams or Zoom were agreed with evenings and weekends available to maximise participation All participants opted for a telephone interview A topic guide was utilised to examine prospective acceptability for the healthy lifestyle programme Appendix Questions in the topic guide were based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability Sekhon et al Participants were reminded they could pause or stop completely at any time At the end of the interview participants were verbally debriefed regarding the purpose of the study All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed using the inbuilt features of Microsoft Teams and researchers LB RP checked the transcripts for accuracy Any identifiable information in the transcript was removed and replaced with a pseudonym or participant ID Interviews were conducted by two experienced female qualitative researchers LB and RP neither of whom had children or prior direct experience with the NCMP or the healthy lifestyle programme However the interviewers were mindful of low uptake of the healthy lifestyle programme and how the NCMP is generally poorly perceived Participants were reminded that the research team were not involved in the NCMP or delivery of the healthy lifestyle programme to reassure participants that honest disclosure of their opinions was encouraged Data analysis Survey responses were exported from Qualtrics and analysed using SPSS and Microsoft Excel Data were reported descriptively using mean standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency percentage for categorical variables Microsoft Word and Excel were used for coding and analysing the interview data Interview responses were analysed using framework analysis where the data were coded deductively into the seven domains of the TFA affective attitude burden ethicality perceived effectiveness intervention coherence self efficacy and opportunity costs Sekhon et al Any utterances that were relevant to the research question but did not align with the domains of the TFA were coded inductively Quantitative and qualitative data from survey and interview responses respectively were then triangulated and analysed in combination in line with each domain of the TFA Results Participants Sixty people responded to the survey and thirteen expressed an interest in taking part in the interviews Six participants were then interviewed however the remainder later declined participation Participant demographics are shown in Table Overall the majority of participants were female aged years White British and employed Of the survey participants n survey participants had accessed their child s NCMP reported weight status with one participant reporting an overweight status A further participants had not accessed their child s reported weight status but believed their child to be a healthy weight Thirty nine survey participants had never heard about the healthy lifestyle programme and participants reported knowing a bit or had heard some things about it Of the interviewed participants none had accessed their child s NCMP reported weight status but four believed their child to be a healthy weight Prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme Survey and interview findings were triangulated to provide an overall representation of participants responses in line with each domain of the TFA Qualitative and quantitative findings were largely complementary with qualitative interview data mostly found to agree with and expand upon survey responses for each domain Affective Attitude Survey data revealed n participants would definitely sign up to the programme and n participants reported that they would consider it Many survey participants cited that they were open to attending a programme to promote healthier choices If there was a problem with my child s weight I would want to do something about it survey open text comment Also how it might help themselves as parents and caregivers to gain access to relevant information I m always on the lookout for information and help to get my kids to eat well and how to be a better parent survey open text comment However some participants reflected on how they were confident they already had appropriate health management tools in place for their family We are a fairly active family that s eats in moderation already survey open text comment Some participants described how they were not sure if the programme would suit them or their child with concerns around learning mobility and availability Not sure it would suit my special needs child survey open text comment This type of help is not usually available to working parents survey open text comment Interviewees initial feelings about the programme were generally more positive than those given in survey responses Most interviewees had heard about the programme but the majority did not share detailed knowledge about the programme content purpose nor target audience In response to the researcher s brief overview of the programme participants reported seeing the potential benefits it is a difficult process trying to find the right nutrition and everything for kids and balancing physical exercise and giving them something to do every day after school So I think to have that support about the right things to feed and do it as a family approach as well I think it s a good set up P Participants felt there would be benefits to attending including the opportunity to meet others and share experiences and the potential for socialising their children I think it s always good to hear from other families and how they approach things in the group setting like they might have tips or you know things that they do that I could apply in my life P I did look at it just for the social aspect If the children would get to do something separate from the adults I would be sort of more willing to go because then he s getting a bit more of a social aspect P Burden Twenty four survey participants disagreed that effort was required to engage with the programme However concerns were stated by both survey and interview participants about the length of the programme being too long The thing that would make me be like Nah would be the fact that it s seven weeks long Like that just seems like that s too much P Most survey participants selected sessions as a more desirable programme length whilst one interviewee suggested that they would be more open to participation if they could choose which sessions to attend let s say we were given a timetable and it was each week and then the topic they were gonna cover and it was kind of like you could pick and choose which ones you went to I think that that would make me more likely to pursue it than if I saw it and was just like right I have to be committed for seven weeks P Another issue was regarding the location of the sessions The sessions are delivered across a number of locations e g community centres remotely however most survey participants selected their child s school as a preferred venue This was reiterated in the interviews where many participants believed the programme should be delivered at the schools their children attended I think school would be the most ideal I think it s a friendly and familiar space P Other suggestions from survey participants included GP surgeries at home or at a local children centre All in all participants stated that the location would need to be local and an appropriate travelling distance But to be honest as long as it s a reasonable travelling distance that wouldn t matter as long as it wasn t a ridiculous journey we d be quite happy to do it P Perceived effectiveness Forty one survey participants agreed the programme would likely encourage changes in diet and physical activity Interviewees also considered it to be largely valuable and positive however most of the participants believed they were already engaging in the practices that the programme would aim to teach families and children so there was nothing for them to gain personally I didn t see what the value of going would be because quite a lot of the stuff it was talking about doing we do here anyway like he cooks with us and we ll we ll talk about what s healthy and what isn t healthy with him when we re eating it so I didn t see the point in going P However participants did see the effectiveness of the programme for families that do not already practice healthy eating the mum would feed her children fish fingers and chips or chicken nuggets and chips and stuff like that In my head it s for people like that so help them understand how to make like healthy foods for their children and sort of help and to give their children ideas for what s good and what s not good P Intervention coherence Thirty two survey participants agreed the programme would help make healthier choices This was supported through interviews which indicated that participants understood the aim of the programme and believed it would be appropriate for people who needed it providing they engaged with the content It does sound like if you needed it it would be helpful if people were willing to engage with it Obviously you don t see some positive outcomes if they re not gonna engage then P Self efficacy Self efficacy was high among most participants with twenty nine survey participants suggesting that they did have the confidence to engage with the programme And interviewees indicating that they felt they would be able to apply the content to their own lives I think it d be good I think we d be able to do it apply programme content As I say we enjoy learning new skills and doing different things as a family P Some participants however did discuss how viable the advice around healthy eating would be within the rising cost of living The thing about healthy eating obviously is cost isn t it Is it affordable Like a bar of chocolate s a lot more cheaper and filling than say a piece fruit or something P Opportunity costs When asked about prioritising the programme fifteen survey participants suggested the programme would interfere with other priorities and interviewees suggested that attending the programme was not a priority as their children were not overweight or did not have obesity However participants did declare that they would prioritise their attendance at the programme if it was needed If it was something that I felt we needed then I would prioritise it P Most participants described numerous prior commitments already held reiterating how families would have to juggle existing commitments to attend we have some sort of standing commitments anyway but as long as it was on a day where like we didn t have something going on it would be fine P Ethicality Interviewees felt that the content would largely resemble practices they already engaged in at home e g making healthier choices portion control maintaining a well balanced diet Two participants however raised ethical concerns around how the programme facilitators would manage addressing weight in a safe stigma free way My only concern is if you find out a child is significantly heavier than they re supposed to be is there enough support around helping them and their family and get them to what you see as the right sort of weight P If it s in the school day and it s in the school I would feel a bit like my daughter would feel not embarrassed cause like she wouldn t really care or understand but it s a bit like ohh why re these kids going into a group and other kids aren t P Participants also discussed if the programme content would be tailored or adjusted to specific needs appropriately such as culture dietary needs and socio economic status maybe people are like intolerant to dairy or wheat or there are vegans or vegetarians pescatarians or you know like all these different groups of people that have specific dietary requirements or cultural things P are they gonna also address the fact that some families don t have as much money to spend on food and then kind of give you advice or information about how to adapt to different budgets P One participant emphasised needing to know who was delivering the programme and whether the content was evidence based I would want some sort of and not even necessarily like a formal qualification but experience or expertise in the areas that they re advising me on P General acceptability Overall survey participants described the programme as acceptable and offered positive remarks about it I think it s great to get as much information as you can for your family there s always room to learn something new or try new things survey open text comment The need for clarity around programme content Interviewees raised several uncertainties about the programme Upon reading promotional materials i e leaflets NMCP letters and the Parent Portal participants expressed a lack of clarity about who the programme target audience was So there was a bit of information on the school newsletter saying we ve attached erm this this leaflet about the programme I m not sure if it was the same programme or something similar that they re doing for just free school meal children I wasn t sure if it was something that we could do because we re not a free school meal family P Some participants noted it would be helpful if the promotional materials provided more detail about what was covered in the programme This would help parents and caregivers decide whether they would benefit from attending Obviously you can t put the full programme and you wouldn t want to but sometimes a few examples is enough to go oh that s what that means that d be really interesting or not P Another participant discussed how they had tried to search for details about the programme online but found the information confusing I did Google it the programme but not a lot came up and what it did show a lot different areas So I was a bit lost and confused P Participants reported a preference for interactive sessions but were not sure what kind of delivery format the programme adopted which again posed as a barrier to attendance As long as it s fun for them children I think they d be alright and it s not just sitting there listening to a lecture kind of thing you know a bit interactive or something P I would want to know like what the format kind of was So is it gonna be like we re gonna be given tasks and do group work or is it gonna be more like a lecture and you know like where we re told information or is it gonna be more like work sheets P Discussion Summary of findings This study is the first in the UK to investigate the prospective acceptability of healthy lifestyle programmes for children and families Overall general prospective acceptability was high Quantitative survey responses and qualitative interview responses were corroborative with the TFA domains of perceived effectiveness and self efficacy being prominent and perceived burden being a common area of concern Participant responses indicated the healthy lifestyles programme was a good programme to consider attending and engaging with Over half of survey participants agreed that the programme would be helpful in supporting families to make healthier choices Just under of the sample felt confident that if they did attend they would be able to apply the programme content within their daily lives Interview participants however indicated that the programme was not a priority for them with the majority stating that they viewed the programme as an effective tool for other people but not for themselves Common concerns were also centred around the domains of opportunity costs and ethicality including issues with the programme being too long attendance competing with existing priorities and a lack of confidence in the programme leader s qualifications and ability to approach the subject of weight appropriately and sensitively Overall participants felt that the programme sounded appropriate and it would be beneficial for families that needed the extra support but they themselves did not require the programme currently Consistency with the literature The existing literature suggests that high acceptability often predicts good uptake to interventions Diepeveen et al Fisher et al Gulliver et al Hommel et al Sekhon et al with prospective acceptability being a key influencing factor when eligible participants are deciding whether or not to take part in an intervention RCT Sekhon et al Establishing prospective acceptability therefore is an effective method for identifying and addressing barriers to enrolment in interventions such as healthy lifestyle programmes Ortblad et al Sekhon et al This study identified burden and ethicality as the main barriers to enrolment yet overall prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyles programme was high Despite this uptake to the programme remains low with many participants stating that the programme is acceptable but not necessary for their family In relation to the impact of ethicality on enrolment a critical barrier is the stigma associated with being overweight and attending associated programmes Previous studies have reported that overweight children frequently do not perceive themselves as being fat nor do they want their peers to see them as such therefore they are reluctant to attend programmes targeting weight loss Grow et al Similarly many parents do not want to raise the subject of weight with their children or enrol them in programmes for fear of upsetting them or harming their self esteem Grow et al Newson et al Visram Hall Geddes This was reflected in our study with many participants expressing concerns about how the programme would be delivered and how their child s weight would be addressed The NCMP has previously received negative feedback from parents and ethical concerns around body image and stigma in young children Falconer et al Gainsbury Dowling Gillison Beck Lewitt Hughes Timpson Mooney et al Statham et al Syrad et al The relationship between NCMP and the healthy lifestyles programme may also be influential to the perceived ethicality of this programme As such it is vital that healthy lifestyle programmes address issues associated with weight in a sensitive manner and provide clear information to parents about the role of the programme as an independent entity to the NCMP Information and advertising materials that clearly reflect the programme s content and sensitive approach to weight management may offer reassurance to parents and caregivers Explorations in the TFA domain of burden demonstrated that logistics were an important issue when participants were considering enrolling in the programme Scheduling issues and logistical problems such as conflicting activities have previously been reported as key barriers in reviews investigating enrolment and retention in weight management programmes Dhaliwal et al Lucas et al Skelton Beech Participants expressed that they have competing priorities and that the duration of the programme is too long for them to commit to Scheduling sessions at less burdensome or more flexible times e g evenings or weekends or providing remote attendance options may reduce the perceived burden and improve enrolment and attendance Overall prospective acceptability for the healthy lifestyles programme was high particularly in the domains of self efficacy and perceived effectiveness However participants still indicated that they did not intend to enrol in the programme as it was not relevant for them Previous qualitative studies with parents of children with overweight and obesity have suggested that parental denial is a barrier to enrolment in programmes such as the one investigated in this study Grow et al Newson et al Visram et al Although over half of our participants agreed that the programme would be helpful in supporting families that attend to make healthier choices the majority did not believe that the programme content would be relevant for them The frequency of these responses may reflect parental denial of an overweight status in their own children However many parents did not share the weight status of their child therefore it is not possible to ascertain the accuracy of participants assessments that their child would not benefit from the programme Gathering information with regards to children s weight status at the time of survey interview participation would allow future research to better assess the role of parental denial vs a genuine lack of need when investigating enrolment in healthy lifestyle programmes Previous research shows that enrolment and continued attendance in healthy lifestyle programmes is higher when children view the programme as an opportunity to have fun and make friends Grow et al Newson et al Stockton et al Social interaction was a moderator of affective attitude towards the healthy lifestyles programme in our study with some participants expressing an interest in attending the programme if their children would get a chance to socialise during the sessions Participants said they would be encouraged to enrol in the healthy lifestyles programme if it provided an opportunity to interact with and support other parents This reflects the findings of Newson et al where families were more likely to decide to attend a childhood obesity intervention if the social aspects were clearly advertised Previous studies have reported a preference for an holistic approach to healthy lifestyles Programmes including physical activities and behavioural components rather than a focus on weight loss or dieting alone are more acceptable to parents and carers Grow et al Newson et al Stockton et al This was also apparent in this study with participants expressing that they would be more likely to attend if they knew the format was more interactive rather than lecture based Whilst the healthy lifestyle programme being investigated in this study does provide many of the elements highlighted here i e socialisation opportunities for the children and an interactive approach to learning about healthy living many participants were unsure of the programme format and this added to their hesitancy in enrolling This emphasises the importance of accurate communication and marketing to ensure that key details are included A lack of clarity and information in promotional materials was a notable barrier to enrolment in this study Interview participants expressed uncertainty about a number of elements of the programme including who had written the content the expertise of the deliverers what the delivery format was and who the programme was for This lack of information appeared to play a significant role in preventing participants from enrolling in the programme The importance of clear communication in overcoming barriers to enrolment in family health programmes has previously been demonstrated by qualitative research assessing retrospective parental acceptability of a family based intervention for young children with obesity Kinlin et al identified a clear theme of insufficient programme information at the time of referral and a limited understanding of the intervention impacting parents expectations of services and affecting their decision to enrol Improving the marketing and communication materials for the healthy lifestyles programme would effectively address many of the concerns identified using the TFA such as ethicality and opportunity costs Many facilitatory factors identified such as opportunities for socialisation and interactive learning are already in place Therefore more accurate or detailed information would provide an opportunity to highlight these areas and increase programme enrolment Strengths and limitations This study is one of the first studies to use the TFA Sekhon et al to prospectively explore specific constructs of acceptability for intervention refinement Applying the TFA facilitated a structured and comprehensive approach to which has enabled us to anticipate and address potential issues in advance to support intervention engagement and uptake The use of a mixed methods design triangulated data and adherence to COREQ guidelines demonstrate considerable rigour in the research process reported here We did not reach the recommended participants for qualitative research Francis et al no new themes emerged from the interviews following the survey open text responses Whilst we did request that participants share their child s NCMP weight status many participants had not accessed or did not want to access this information Therefore no accurate data concerning the weight status of participants children was available to inform the interpretation of our results and subsequent recommendations This limits the extent to which we can draw conclusions about the specific prospective acceptability of this programme to the families of children carrying excess weight compared to those of a healthy weight The interviews in this study were attended by female caregivers so future research may consider strategies to engage male caregivers in sharing their opinions of healthy lifestyles programmes Further the sample overall was majority female White British aged years and employed The extent to which the results can be generalised to the wider population is limited and may be specific to this demographic Future research may benefit from targeted recruitment of male younger years or older years caregivers or caregivers to children from non white under represented or seldom heard communities Implications and recommendations Participants views indicate that a healthy lifestyle programme could be valuable to parents and caregivers of children with overweight and obesity and could influence positive changes in families behaviours Several approaches could help to address the acceptability issues identified by the present study For instance detailed communication and clear advertising for parents and carers about the benefits of healthy lifestyle programmes are needed this could be delivered during events where parents are already present at the school e g parents evening Evidence from this study suggests that the materials used to advertise the programme should provide clearer information about who the programme is for what the content is the format of delivery and who will deliver the programme A key facilitator to enrolment that was identified in this study and supported by previous research is the opportunity for social interaction provided by the programme It would therefore be beneficial to highlight the interactive nature of the programme referring to the included activities such as preparing and tasting food and playing games This would allow parents and caregivers to weigh up the potential benefits to attending the programme against any perceived barriers Emphasising that the course is free to attend and introducing flexible attendance may also reduce the burden of commitment associated with the week programme and promote attendance Conclusion This study was the first to investigate the prospective acceptability of a self referral healthy lifestyles programme Exploring prospective acceptability using the TFA enabled a comprehensive structured exploration from which we were able to prioritise most significant barriers and enablers affecting engagement with and uptake of the programme Acceptability was generally high but a significant information barrier was identified with many parents indicating that they were unaware of the programme s existence and those who were aware of it demonstrating uncertainty about content and eligibility to attend Participant responses indicate that parents recognise the value of programmes such as these for supporting families to make healthier choices although many parents do not believe that they are the target audience The benefit of these programmes for allowing social interactions amongst both children and parents as well as for providing an interactive learning environment was also highlighted If schools and healthy lifestyle services therefore provide clearer signposting about the format and content of the programme its purpose and who is eligible to attend as well as addressing the time commitment required by the current programme this may help to increase enrolment References Biro F M Wien M Childhood obesity and adult morbidities The American journal of clinical nutrition S S Department of Health and Social Care Childhood obesity a plan for

inequalities To better meet healthcare needs dedicated mental health and general nurses were implemented to deliver outreach healthcare to people experiencing homelessness in one United Kingdom UK county During COVID the UK Government also instructed local authorities to accommodate individuals sleeping rough and have a national target to end rough sleeping This qualitative study explored experiences of this nurse let outreach service and housing journeys during and beyond COVID among people experiencing homelessness Study design Face to face narrative storytelling interviews were conducted via opportunistic sampling in community settings Individuals with recent or current experiences of homelessness were eligible Methods Participants were informed about the study via known professionals and introduced to the researcher Eighteen narrative interviews were conducted transcribed and analysed using reflective thematic analysis Results Individuals described complex journeys in becoming and being homeless The nurse led outreach service provided integral support with reported benefits to person centred and accessible care and improved outcomes in health and wellbeing After being housed individuals valued housing necessities and described new responsibilities However some participants did not accept or stay in housing provisions where they perceived risks Conclusions Interviewed participants perceived that the dedicated nurse led outreach service improved their access to care and health outcomes In the absence of dedicated provisions mainstream healthcare should ensure flexible processes and collaborative professional working Local authorities must also be afforded increased resources for housing as well as integrated support to reduce social and health inequalities Keywords Homeless Housing Health Inequalities Healthcare Access COVID Narrative Interviews Introduction Homelessness is defined as the lack of a place someone can legally live or reasonably stay A more visible form of homelessness is rough sleeping where individuals may live on the streets or in tents with forms including sofa surfing or squatting referred to as hidden homelessness It is therefore challenging to confirm the extent of homelessness but recent figures estimated people were homeless in the United Kingdom UK with individuals recorded as rough sleeping during an annual count in England Eligibility for housing is assessed by local authorities who should accommodate individuals with a specified priority need Some individuals are ineligible including those with no recourse to public funds As a health protection measure during COVID the UK government instructed local authorities to accommodate individuals rough sleeping termed Everyone In Following the lockdown in March local authorities in England were required to accommodate homeless individuals not usually entitled to housing using hostels hotels and other accommodations Criteria for priority need was also later extended to individuals deemed extremely clinically vulnerable However after June eligibility for housing otherwise fluctuated alongside lockdowns Everyone In was reported to have offered accommodation to of rough sleepers by April However one charity reported that more than three quarters of those initially accommodated did not move into settled accommodation of at least six months The UK aims to end rough sleeping by Therefore it is crucial to understand and improve factors associated with accessing and maintaining housing following homelessness Homelessness is a significant consequence and determinant of social and health inequalities Individuals experiencing homelessness are more likely to have experienced family instability poverty mental illness substance misuse abuse incarceration and be care experienced and experience poorer health unequal access to healthcare and shorter life expectancies People experiencing homelessness have reported barriers to registering with primary care stigma and a lack of continued and integrated healthcare Such inequalities increase emergency care utilisation among homeless populations Dedicated healthcare provisions for homeless individuals have therefore been implemented often adopting community based and outreach approaches Services must also work collaboratively given the inter relations between housing and health Local context This study evaluates aspects of healthcare and housing provision in Warwickshire a UK county Warwickshire is a rural county with smaller and larger towns and increased rates of homelessness given the population Rural homelessness is associated with challenges in effective commissioning and delivering services across greater distances In Warwickshire the local authority commissioned dedicated nurses to deliver outreach healthcare to individuals rough sleeping or vulnerable housed e g in temporary accommodation The service was co produced and delivered in collaboration with the local health service and voluntary organisations further described elsewhere Two senior mental health nurses deliver psychological therapies and motivational interviewing and two senior general nurses provide care for issues such as wounds and blood borne viruses Interviews conducted with involved professionals indicated that the service increased access to person centred care Further benefits were from mental health and general nurses working together and with multidisciplinary partners to scaffold wider support The perspectives and experiences of homeless individuals eligible to access this service must also be understood Given the interactions between housing and health this evaluation aimed to explore homeless individuals journeys with housing and health provisions alongside the novel context of COVID Methods Design This qualitative study involved face to face interviews with individuals with experience of homelessness To improve appropriateness the study was co designed with stakeholders in the local authority voluntary organisations and the nurses Coventry University Ethics Committee approved this study in February P Eligibility and recruitment Participants were adults with current or recent experience of homelessness Participants were required to have sufficient English to talk about their experiences and provide verbal or written consent Opportunity sampling was employed within community spaces supported accommodations and voluntary and community organisations across four towns Recruitment was facilitated by co located professionals including the nurses Professionals discussed the study with eligible individuals where appropriate i e according to wellbeing on the day and ability to give informed consent and then introduced the participant to the researcher who gained consent Data collection Data were collected during March and April Participant information was read to or by all participants Informed consent was collected via a written form or verbal transcript to include individuals with impairments or limited reading or writing skills A verbal narrative story telling method was employed to collect data previously used in research with people experiencing homelessness Storytelling interviews are characterised by unstructured formats where the participant constructs their story with the interviewer Narrative inquiry enables participants to share their experiences in an order and manner that matters to them and enables the researcher to hear about wider contexts Two broad questions invited participants to talk about their journey with housing including during COVID and their experiences of accessing healthcare including the nurse led outreach service Prompts reflections and follow up questions were asked to help participants move through their story and clarify events Audio recorded interviews were conducted with one trained researcher Participants could have a professional present Participants were offered a supermarket food outlet voucher to thank them for their time Verbal and written debriefs were provided Analysis Audio recordings were semi auto transcribed using Microsoft Word and corrected Transcription was verbatim including hesitations and repetitions Analysis adopted a six stage reflexive thematic analysis iteratively coding responses and organising codes into themes and subthemes Analysis was underpinned by social constructionism which assumes that meaning is constructed through social interactions For example a participant s storytelling may be influenced by perceived power differences or previous experience in an interview situation This lens aligned with the embeddedness of the study design whereby professionals facilitated recruitment and the subjectivity of researchers is embraced Results A total of participants took part in interviews ranging from minutes No professionals remained closely present during interviews Demographics Participants were aged to years and most often male n and White British n Most participants reported difficulties estimating how long they had been homeless often with cycles of episodic homelessness Findings Four overarching themes were interpreted from the narrative interviews each capturing poignant experiences in participants stories These themes are discussed and presented with quotations Theme Becoming homeless Participants discussed the circumstances leading to becoming homeless and some described cyclical patterns of homelessness Though experiences varied commonalities leading to homelessness included bereavements and relationship breakdowns I lived with my mum when she died I had to leave the house Erm so I got put in a B B Bed and Breakfast I ended up living on like the streets in town and sleeping in doorways And then COVID had hit and during COVID they I think they had to house people P why we got evicted is cause I lost my children they re in foster care Ever since that you know just stopped paying everything P Participants faced complex issues including finances mental and physical health problems broken relationships and isolation When these issues compounded cyclical patterns of homelessness were more apparent When you re street homeless everything just seems as worse as possible as it as it can be There s no future There s no respite from it there s no rest from it it s ten times worse P Theme Unable to escape a stigmatised identity Participants described living a stigmatised identity through sharing experiences of discrimination and abuse Participants often collectively referred to negative stereotypes held among the public such as assumptions of drug and alcohol use and lamented how little understanding of homelessness existed People just look down at you a fella come out and started on me and he said stop being a drug addict and like started on me everyone thinks everyone s an alcoholic or drug addict when they re homeless and I wasn t an addict P Some participants felt discriminated against by national housing or organisational policies Such processes may be necessary for the prioritisation of resources but some participants expressed frustrations that this meant they stayed rough sleeping for longer Some participants felt unheard by services I didn t have a priority need then to help me get off the street which means I have to remain on the street longer P I don t know what s the point they won t listen they ain t bothered That s how I feel P Experiences with inflexible systems were also reiterated Participants described that not having resources like a smart phone restricted access to healthcare and other services Unless you ve got a smart phone it s impossible It s the same now with doctors I tried to sort my electric out the other day for this flat I ve been given and I said look can I send you proof of tenancy through the post and they re like no it s gotta be done over smartphone I says but I haven t got a smartphone So they won t let me put the bill in my name P Theme Nurses are a crucial bridge connecting us to healthcare The nurse led outreach service was well received with participants collectively endorsing that this service should continue Participants compared the nurses to family members and described receiving treatment and feeling cared for The outreach service was contrasted with previous inflexible and unsupportive experiences with mainstream healthcare Well the nurses are pretty good actually on the streets If it wasn t for the nurses like going around the streets at the minute for the homeless what would the homeless have they d have nothing P There s two professionals like representing for you so It s like a family member you know they said say you should always go to see a doctor with a family member so there s another pair of eyes and ears there so you wouldn t just get fobbed off cause a lot of them do try and fob you off P The outreach relational and friendly approach of the nurses was crucial Participants could choose whether they wanted to engage and the nurses could identify changes in someone s health Many participants described that accessing the dedicated homeless nurses was easier than attending primary care settings because the nurses visited them in situ rather than requiring travel to an appointment Nurse led drop in sessions in community spaces also offered more direct access to healthcare Instead of waiting to get through to your doctor they ask what s wrong over the phone you can just ask like I asked nurse about my wrist the other day it s really a lot easier having access to them in here P It s been helpful erm they re much more approachable than the GP Also they ll come out to see me which is a benefit it means I can plan my work P Participants perceived that their health had improved because of access to care and treatments as well as the nurses supporting them to develop self efficacy with managing their health Like making sure I take my medication I got antibiotics blood thinners erm epilepsy tablets and if I didn t come here and her nurse help me I wouldn t take them P nurse did me a prescription and she got my leg sorted and all sorts of things So without nurse I would have been screwed really to be honest P Theme Being housed and beyond Participants relayed their journeys to being housed including the role of COVID and moving between emergency or temporary accommodations Participants described a range of feelings after being housed following rough sleeping Participants expressed gratitude and needing to adjust to having amenities like a kitchen television and bed Some questioned how they had ever slept rough Participants also discussed additional responsibilities in managing their income and developing household skills now when I look at homeless people I m thinking wow how do they actually do that how do they do that I don t know how I was doing it with a little sleeping bag P I have to like keep pride in it make sure it s tidy the bills are paid make sure that I don t let certain people in now You got a responsibility P Being housed also made logistically receiving and storing medical supplies feasible benefitting health management I think if I was homeless again I would struggle Because I have to have a lot of medical stuff sent to me like the pouches and the sprays and everything that s all sent to me so I d need some kind of address P Some participants were housed in areas or situations that posed risks to health wellbeing and maintaining tenancies such as via substance misuse by other tenants This was sometimes linked to an insufficient supply of housing Embedded support provisions were needed to reduce or respond to these risks I wanted to get out of there cause there was one or two of them drinking a lot P As suggested here maintaining housing including following Everyone In was often a greater challenge than being housed Participants reflected that systems did not work with people Specific accommodation policies such as visiting policies intended to safeguard tenants and availability of housing in preferred locations meant some participants did not accept or stay in housing provisions I let somebody in and I got kicked out P They tried to send me off to neighbouring local authority So I went street homeless because like I said my kids are in current area my parents are in current area P In addition some participants reported not knowing when or where they would be moved until the time came because of rapid rehousing needs waiting lists or professionals bidding on their behalf It s hard because we had to wait for the housing officer to say this is happening And we didn t know where we were going until we was in a taxi We would ask the taxi driver where we was going and he d tell us P Discussion Eighteen people described their stories of homelessness and healthcare during COVID and beyond The nurse led outreach service was highly commended Participants described the nurses akin to family members because of the care and advocacy they provided The flexible service was contrasted with experiences of inaccessible mainstream care Housing journeys were complex and non linear After being housed including during COVID participants valued housing necessities Some expressed disbelief about how they had normalised life on the streets However some participants did not accept or stay in housing where they perceived risks This study follows an evaluation of the nurse led service from the professionals perspective The inter relations between mental health physical health and housing were evidenced across both studies with social exclusion of homeless individuals further depicted People experiencing homelessness face reduced access to mainstream healthcare because of inflexible systems unaffordability professional attitudes and an individual s ability to access care Participants here reiterated these experiences and valued the friendly and dedicated approach of the dedicated nurses Participants perceived that the nurses provided direct access to care and promoted self efficacy in self care found to be low among people experiencing homelessness Participants linked having a secure home with improved wellbeing and being able to store medical supplies which can improve medication adherence Where dedicated healthcare provisions for homeless individuals are not commissioned policymakers should ensure that mainstream healthcare is flexible and person centred and that providers work collaboratively For example having an address is not legally required to register with a primary care provider although some providers may request this and contribute to inequalities Further research investigating emergency care utilisation among individuals accessing nurse led outreach services would develop understanding about the wider health and economic benefits COVID brought additional complexities for local authorities needing to provide rapid housing Housing First models similarly prioritise providing rapid housing regardless of substance use and have reported success for housing stability and health outcomes However participants here highlighted that rapid housing must also integrate adequate support to ensure individuals maintain tenancies Some participants described risks associated with other tenants misusing substances Such experiences may pose health risks to peer influenced substance use and housing instability if individuals leave the accommodation With evidence that initial reductions in homelessness during COVID were not maintained nationally sufficient resources must be available to local authorities to provide housing and integrated support Strengths and Limitations Using narrative methodology participants chose how to share their story This approach meant participants were in greater control of their interview especially as journeys were complex Although some participants may not have been aware of how their housing journey related to Everyone In such as if their situation was managed by a professional Participants were not directly asked about social care and so any role of social care in a participant s story may not have been explored The face to face approach meant that participants met the researcher in settings familiar to them and was facilitated by known professionals However individuals not accessing any health provisions or support services were not interviewed This study also interviewed a male majority though women told their stories Women are more likely to fall into hidden homelessness using informal support networks for longer before presenting to local authorities and can experience gender based discrimination Interviews were conducted only in English and with majority White British participants with wider evidence advocating for improvements to anti racist and culturally responsive provisions Some interviews were also short Health problems and autism found to be more common among people experiencing homelessness may have also contributed to shorter lengths Interpreting the findings alongside national and international evidence will also contribute to a fuller picture of the impact of COVID on people experiencing homelessness Conclusion This qualitative evaluation explored the stories of people who have experienced homelessness in one UK county In telling their stories participants highlighted the benefits of person centred approaches to healthcare and housing provisions Participants described that the dedicated nurse led outreach service made it easier to access healthcare and self reported improvements with their health and wellbeing Furthermore mainstream healthcare should improve inclusion through flexible processes and professional training about homelessness COVID posed challenges for local authorities who were instructed to house individuals rough sleeping Stories from participants provided further evidence that local authorities must be afforded sufficient resources to end homelessness and help people maintain tenancies

additional smoking cessation strategy for pregnant women Although e cigarettes are being increasingly offered within services there is limited understanding about whether e cigarettes can improve smoking cessation support for pregnant individuals This study aimed to explore service users experiences of using e cigarettes as a tool for smoking cessation during pregnancy Methods Semi structured

hazards associated with tobacco in forms such as patches gum and Int J Environ Res Public Health doi org ijerph www mdpi com journal ijerph Int J Environ Res Public Health of tablets are often offered to support smoking cessation Whilst NRT are indicated to be substantially safer than smoking cigarettes to date there is low quality evidence investigating the efficacy of NRT for smoking cessation in pregnant populations and low adherence in trials NRT are recommended and endorsed as part of standard practice in the UK However pregnant women have identified the need for greater options and support for smoking cessation strategies Rates of smoking in pregnancy are also higher among people with more socioeconomic disadvantage yet evidence suggests that women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds might benefit less from interventions currently available One alternative additional offer for smoking cessation in pregnant women is the use of e cigarettes E cigarettes also known as vapes normally contain nicotine in varying strengths but do not contain the hazardous chemicals and tar inhaled via smoking to bacco Whilst the evidence base for the safety of e cigarettes in pregnancy is still developing they are predicted to have benefits in terms of being a safer alternative to smoking vaping products are viewed as substantially less harmful than smoking Growing in popularity e cigarette use has been found to be more effective than traditional NRT for smoking cessation in non pregnant people as well as more cost effective to the National Health Service NHS Among pregnant women evidence of the effectiveness of e cigarettes is lacking A recent RCT has found that after excluding participants who used non allocated products e cigarettes were more effective in prolonged validated quit rates compared to the nicotine patch arm vs The authors described a similar safety profile for e cigarettes as nicotine patches in pregnant women including maternal outcomes birth outcomes and adverse events Low birth weight was significantly less often reported in the arm using e cigarettes A secondary analysis of that RCT showed that regular use of e cigarettes does not appear to be associated with adverse outcomes such as birth weight The evidence is still emerging about the use of e cigarettes as a smoking harm reduction tool in pregnant women There is geographical variation in how local governments and health trusts provide smoking cessation services to pregnant groups and only of local governments currently offer e cigarettes The provision of e cigarettes as a smoking cessation strategy in pregnancy is increasing and considerable further evaluation is needed to understand whether e cigarettes can offer improved smoking cessation support Specifically more qualitative evaluation has been instructed to capture the experiences of pregnant individuals offered e cigarettes as a smoking cessation and harm reduction tool To fill this knowledge gap we explored the views of pregnant individuals using e cigarettes as an alternative offer within smoking cessation services in two UK based pilots Methods Study Design A qualitative evaluation in two UK sites Warwickshire and Bath and Northeast Somerset was conducted to explore service users experiences of a pilot to offer e cigarettes as a tool for smoking cessation during pregnancy Context The pilot has been described in depth elsewhere Implemented by two local authorities e cigarettes were added as an alternative tool within smoking cessation in preg nancy services with the aim of improving service engagement and outcomes All women were referred to a specialist stop smoking in pregnancy service and offered e cigarettes in addition to standard treatment NRT and behavioural support to help abstain from smoking This was a week programme with ongoing support throughout pregnancy and postnatally as needed In Pilot women were supplied with up to two disposable e cigarette devices a week with different available flavours depending on smoking habits and verified by CO carbon monoxide readings Each e cigarette device provided s puffs roughly equating to cigarettes mg of nicotine The three flavours on offer Int J Environ Res Public Health of were tobacco menthol and blueberry with tobacco flavour encouraged at the beginning of a quit and fruity flavours later In Pilot pregnant women received a refillable and rechargeable pen style e cigarette with a choice of e liquid flavours tobacco menthol and berry proving most popular and nicotine strengths and provided CO readings in line with standard practice Both pilots offered service users information about e cigarettes and only declared their use as a short term harm reduction tool to support pregnant women to fully quit and that long term it would be best for women and babies to not use any kind of cigarette Participant Selection Sampling Participants were women aged years or older who had enrolled on the e cigarette pilot at two sites Pregnant women were not invited to interview if they had experienced pregnancy complications or a miscarriage Setting Interviews were conducted either in person n all for Pilot or by telephone n and participants were offered evening and weekend slots Participant Selection Method of Approach Stop smoking in pregnancy advisers hereon referred to as advisers held primary re sponsibility for participant recruitment Advisers shared information about the interviews with informed consent collected via paper or online via Qualtrics Individuals provided contact details and basic demographic information and agreed to be contacted by the research team The research team arranged convenient days and times for the interviews Data Collection A semi structured interview guide was developed with colleagues from the University of Bath and used for Pilot The guide was adapted by Coventry University to use for Pilot participants to ensure relevancy to Pilot Interviews were conducted with as many service users as possible during the recruitment period Pilot ran from October September Pilot ran July May with a month suspension from October December due to insufficient resources No interviews were repeated Interviews were transcribed manually with all identifiable information deleted The research team checked transcripts for accuracy against the recordings Transcripts were not returned to participants Research Team and Reflexivity In Pilot interviews were conducted by one female researcher RS who had an MSc and years of local authority public health experience specialising in tobacco control In Pilot two female researchers conducted the interviews ELW LT Both authors had prior experience in interviewing and had obtained ELW or submitted LT PhDs at the point of data collection ELW RS and JA had experience of being pregnant and receiving NHS maternity care None of the interviewers were current smokers and one had previously smoked Data Analysis Transcripts were analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach After familiarisation via conducting and or reading the interviews transcripts were inductively coded ELW for comments feelings and experiences that related to the use of e cigarettes within the pilot at a semantic level Coded data were organised into appropriate sub themes and then themes using an Excel workbook for each site Data for Pilot and Pilot were initially analysed separately and then combined merging and revising sub themes and themes Theme development was discussed and revised ELW RP LB MW and RS

more comprehensive outline of pilot uptake engagement and retention is pre sented elsewhere Lutman White et al under review To summarise pregnant women accepted the service in Pilot and pregnant women accepted the e cigarette in the pregnancy service in Pilot Of these women eight in Pilot and six in Pilot took part in interviews lasting min on average ranging from min Reasons for the poor uptake of interviews in Pilot included difficulties in contacting people withdrawal of consent general complexity in people s lives and COVID lockdowns All interviewees reported a white ethnicity and on average were aged years ranging from years Prior to enrolling in the pilot women primarily used rolling tobacco only n cigarettes only n cigarettes and rolling tobacco n or were using cigarettes and e cigarettes n At the time of the interview participants had quit from Pilot and from Pilot were dual using combustible cigarettes and an e cigarette from Pilot from Pilot had not quit Pilot and the outcome of the pilot was unknown for participant Pilot Qualitative Findings Thematic analysis generated three main themes which were accompanied by quotes in Table Table An overview of the themes

participants perceptions of the e cigarettes offered within the pilots subtheme A experiences of learning and using the e cigarette subtheme B the role of behavioural support offered subtheme C and overall pilot perceptions subtheme D Int J Environ Res Public Health of Subtheme A The E Cigarette Offered Most participants felt that the e cigarettes offered through the pilots were easy to use high quality and compact and where participants recalled their previous attempts with e cigarettes the pilot e cigarette was preferred Although pocket sized the need for careful transportation was noted A few criticisms were related to the transparent and luminous design of one e cigarette with two Pilot participants comparing it to a glow stick Individuals had mixed views on the types and nicotine strengths of e cigarette or e liquid flavours available Some participants preferred a flavour that more closely replicated tobacco Others chose a flavour that contrasted with tobacco or changed flavours over time however some participants struggled to find a flavour that they liked due to the preponderance of sweet flavours To overcome this issue a few participants suggested sampling flavours could help The e cigarette being free was viewed positively by participants and was assumed to have increased access to those with a lower income One participant reported that due to financial constraints they were therefore able to start their quit attempt with a free e cigarette sooner For some participants however the e cigarette being free was not a key factor Subtheme B Learning and Using the E Cigarette Participants felt they were given the right amount of information about the e cigarette via the advisers Participants reported varying opinions about how long the e cigarettes lasted before needing to be disposed of or recharged highlighting the role of individual usage patterns One participant described needing but not having a spare coil for the refillable e cigarette and so had to buy a new e cigarette before their next appointment to handle cravings Another participant raised concerns that the length of time e cigarettes are supplied for may be too short and risk individuals not being able to maintain a quit attempt Subtheme C Role of Behavioural Support The behavioural support e g face to face visits and encouragement provided by the advisors at both sites was described as helpful non judgemental and informative with regular phone or text contact and in person visits The friendly and dedicated adviser approach was appreciated Support not only addressed smoking behaviours but also the wider factors that can contribute to smoking including stress Two participants summarised the benefits of combining the offer of an e cigarette with behavioural support Subtheme D Overall Perceptions of the Pilot Participants had predominantly positive experiences with the pilot with many saying they would recommend it to others A range of perspectives were reported regarding how accessible and timely the pilot was with one participant describing a smooth pro cess However another participant experienced delays in accessing Pilot likely due to staffing issues Theme Preferences for Using E Cigarettes This theme describes participants negative perceptions and experiences of traditional NRT subtheme A and the advantages of using an e cigarette subtheme B Subtheme A Negative Perceptions and Experiences of Traditional NRT Some but not all participants had previously tried NRT products However most participants held generally negative perceptions of NRT due to factors including taste Though one person found the patches to be good during a previous quit attempt more participants described unpleasant physical sensations and symptoms during pregnancy For these reasons participants preferred e cigarettes over other forms of NRT as an aid to stop smoking Int J Environ Res Public Health of Subtheme B Advantages of Using E Cigarettes One key advantage of e cigarettes over traditional NRT products was the behavioural similarity of using the e cigarette compared with combustible cigarettes They were also perceived as less harmful However not all participants found the e cigarettes to be sufficiently similar Several participants liked the control offered by the e cigarette in terms of monitoring usage Whilst some participants maintained a routine of going to use the e cigarette outside using the e cigarette indoors was another benefit One participant perceived this option could be particularly useful for someone experiencing pregnancy related fatigue or nausea Theme Journeys to Quitting Tobacco This theme captures participants motivations to quit tobacco subtheme A barriers to quitting subtheme B the impact of quitting cigarettes subtheme C and the effec tiveness of the pilot for quitting during pregnancy as well as future smoking intentions subtheme D Subtheme A Motivations to Quit For all pregnant women their pregnancy and the health of the baby were key motiva tors for quitting smoking One participant emphasised that pregnancy had been the only factor motivating them enough to want to quit Other sources of motivation were to save money or because of encouragement from a partner family member or health professional Subtheme B Barriers to Quitting Participants reported several barriers to quitting or factors that made avoiding cigarettes more challenging Two participants described the length of time they had been smoking as a potential barrier Seeing other people smoking was another challenge for motivation Whilst cigarette smoke increased the desire to avoid smoking for some participants for one participant cigarette smoke contributed to cravings Several participants discussed their use of smoking as stress relief highlighting stress as a barrier to quitting Another participant highlighted the association between depression and motivation to quit A further challenge was that participants partners were unable to access a free e cigarette in Pilot whereas Pilot did support where possible which may otherwise have contributed to joint quitting attempts Subtheme C Impact of Quitting Quitting cigarettes within the pilot had various impacts on participants health and behaviours Some participants described benefits to mental wellbeing including feelings of pride and confidence after using an e cigarette Several participants had already noticed or expected improvements in physical health symptoms such as reduced chest infections and wheezing Two participants appreciated that their clothes and homes no longer smelt of cigarettes The perceived impact on partner smoking behaviour was mixed Sometimes partners continued smoking and others also tried to quit using e cigarettes with mixed success One participant described how having an e cigarette around could influence their partner to sometimes use it rather than a combustible cigarette Subtheme D Effectiveness of the Pilot for Quitting and Future Smoking Intentions Most participants reported that they had either quit cigarettes completely or had reduced their cigarette use A few other participants described dual use throughout the pilot and others were more quickly able to eliminate cigarettes entirely Some participants also found the regular carbon monoxide readings motivating and a measure of success There was a notable uncertainty around whether participants would be able to or wanted to quit smoking or e cigarettes in the longer term Several participants planned to continue smoking at a reduced level or to combine cigarettes with e cigarettes Some partic Int J Environ Res Public Health of ipants considered e cigarette use as something they would keep doing Other participants had stronger intentions to maintain smoking cessation Discussion This study describes the experiences and perceptions among individuals who had accepted e cigarettes as part of smoking cessation in pregnancy services in two UK sites and offers an important contribution to the evidence base given the paucity of qualitative insight in this area Overall participants reported that e cigarettes in combination with behavioural support were helpful for reducing smoking tobacco Our findings broadly align with previous qualitative research from a multi centre randomised controlled trial where pregnant women positively perceived e cigarettes to be necessary for smoking cessation and outweighed any concerns Though limited by low trial uptake e cigarettes were also indicated to be more effective for quitting than NRT patches There were largely favourable opinions of the free e cigarette devices though mixed successes with finding a preferred flavour Previous research with a larger sample of pregnant women deduced overall preferences for sweet fruit and mint flavours over tobacco flavours Our evaluation highlights the importance of providing a range of flavours to suit individual preferences as some individuals found replicating tobacco to be a useful strategy for maintaining motivation Perceptions of the behavioural support e g face to face visits and encouragement were overwhelmingly positive and along with providing adequate information and CO verifications helped women s motivation to quit within the pilot consistent with wider understanding Participants particularly valued the supportive interactions from professionals consistent with broader evidence and guidelines that non judgemental support promotes motivation and behaviour change Participants expressed preferences for e cigarettes over other NRT products and liked the behavioural similarities with smoking tobacco although the e cigarette did not satisfy cravings for everyone The existing literature suggests a range of reasons for choosing e cigarettes as a strategy towards this goal including being able to use e cigarettes in smoke free areas and similar hand to mouth action Participants also described that the e cigarette being free had enabled them or could enable others to engage in a quit attempt This finding warrants wider exploration given that previous research has indicated lower effectiveness of typical smoking cessation interventions among pregnant women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds Research has already identified that pregnancy and the baby s health are key motivat ing factors for smoking cessation and in this study the pregnancy and the health of the baby were key motivators to quit smoking It is also necessary to understand and address the potential barriers to smoking cessation in pregnancy to increase success In this study the numerous barriers included the length of time someone had smoked others in the house smoking cigarettes forming part of daily routines depression and stress consistent with previous research Some women in this study also raised concerns about relapses due to post partum stress highlighting the benefits of continued social and professional support for stress and mental wellbeing Positively most participants reported quitting cigarettes or reducing cigarette use with reported benefits to mental and physical health and reduced smells of smoke However there was uncertainty around whether quits could be sustained post partum and longer term and whether participants would stop using e cigarettes in the future Previous reviews have reported that the efficacy of e cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool may decrease following birth and national guidance recommends continuing NRT provision after pregnancy if required to prevent relapse Further evaluation of the maintenance of smoking behaviours postpartum and the role that e cigarettes may play is therefore required Whilst the pilot aimed to achieve smoking cessation for pregnant woman there was an unclear impact of e cigarettes on partners smoking behaviour Reducing the smoking behaviours of partners could have additional health benefits via reduced smoke expo sure as well as offering social support and reduced smoking cues Some participants Int J Environ Res Public Health of highlighted potential opportunities to support partners to quit smoking and further inves tigation is needed to better understand the role of partners in smoking cessation during pregnancy The findings can inform future e cigarette pilots such as embedding non judgemental behavioural support providing appropriate information about e cigarettes supplying multiple flavours to suit various preferences ensuring staffing resources can facilitate a smooth enrolment process and embedding or signposting to longer term support for smoking cessation and wellbeing Strengths and Limitations Interviewing pregnant women who were provided e cigarettes from two different pilot sites is a key strength of the evaluation and developed insight into the similarities and differences among participants experiences However uptake to interviews was challenging with many pregnant women being uncontactable after obtaining consent or at the time of scheduled interviews Those interviewed all reported a white ethnicity and wider experiences and perceptions among individuals from other ethnicities are missing from these findings Data were not explicitly collected on smoking habits or quitting history The two areas in this research varied in demographics with Pilot and Pilot having a and proportion of the population reporting as white respectively We did not interview women who declined to take part in the pilot and so the possible barriers to taking up the e cigarette offer are not reported Conclusions Interviews in this study illuminated how pregnant women taking part in an e cigarette pilot had positive experiences of using e cigarettes and expressed preferences for e cigarettes over NRT There was reported success with quitting combustible cigarettes by using e cigarettes further supporting how e cigarettes are increasingly recognised as a harm reduction method for pregnant smokers in the UK The inclusion of behavioural support was also valued and the e cigarette being free may have improved access to this smoking cessation strategy for individuals with lower incomes However there were numerous barriers to quitting and staying quit and women were often uncertain about whether they would quit smoking or e cigarette use post partum and longer term Further research exploring the views of pregnant women from more diverse backgrounds and those who decline e cigarettes is warranted as well as further consideration of the role and impact of partners who smoke in this timeframe Author Contributions E L W made substantial contributions to the acquisition analysis and interpretation of data drafted

J Environ Res Public Health doi org ijerph www mdpi com journal ijerph Int J Environ Res Public Health of Box Diagnostic criteria and nomenclature history of hEDS HSD Although hEDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion work to identify the genetic cause is ongoing Diagnosis is currently based on the fulfilment of clinical criteria published in and based on expert consensus but without prior validation They consist of generalized joint hy permobility criterion systemic manifestations of a generalised connective tissue disorder family history of hEDS and or musculoskeletal complications criterion and exclusion of alternative diagnoses criterion Individuals who do not meet the full hEDS criteria but who exhibit similar signs and symptoms may be diagnosed with a Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder Although a spectrum of symptoms has been described it is now understood that people with either hEDS or HSD may experience the same potential range of symptoms complications and disease severity and recommended treatments and prognosis are the same thus the distinction may not be clinically meaningful Prior to the criteria previous and overlapping diagnostic classifications were EDS Type III EDS Hypermobility Type or Joint Hyper mobility Syndrome JHS Since individuals should be deemed to have hEDS or HSD without the need for reassessment with the exception of clinical trial entry This study therefore refers to hEDS HSD inclusive of previous names for these diagnoses and in awareness that the nomenclature is likely to change in the future The first study of the diagnosed prevalence of hEDS HSD found that in people in Wales had a diagnosis of either EDS or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome JHS on their medical records Other work has shown figures of in and in for recorded diagnosis We know that many people face long diagnostic delays with many undiagnosed A total of of the general population have chronic pain and hy permobility which has been used as a proxy for hEDS HSD and led to the estimate that in births could be impacted by hEDS HSD In healthcare hEDS HSD can be inadequately managed because of the underdiagnosis and insufficient awareness of these conditions as well as their heterogenous clinical presentation Understanding the implications for childbearing among people with hEDS HSD is therefore essential to achieve a positive and safe birth experience Guidance recommends that an individual assessment is carried out for planning birth with a connective tissue disorder It is therefore important that perinatal staff and individuals with hEDS HSD are aware of the potential risks of complications associated with childbearing However there are limitations to the existing evidence base including the fact that research has not always differentiated between hEDS and the other rare subtypes of EDS To illustrate a population based study found higher rates of premature birth birth by caesarean section and several other complications along with longer hospital stays for post partum care However these findings incorporated all types of EDS including the vascular subtype known to have serious risks during pregnancy Existing research is inconsistent about the rates of obstetric complications among people with hEDS EDS Increased rates of miscarriages including specifically recurrent miscarriage preterm birth and pelvic instability have been reported whilst a large records based study found pregnancy complication rates similar to population incidences A small but in depth study of women with JHS found good overall out comes but potential issues with abnormal scar formation haemorrhage pelvic prolapses deep venous thrombosis and coccyx dislocation Precipitate labour the expulsion of the foetus within three hours of the commencement of contractions has also been suggested as possibly more prevalent among people with hEDS HSD and is asso ciated with significant complications Qualitative research has reported experiences of the worsening of hEDS HSD symptoms during pregnancy as well as ineffective local anaesthesia and long latent phases of labour followed by rapid births Contemporary evidence with larger sample sizes following the re classification is now required to enhance the quality and safety of evidence based practice The aim of this study was to examine pregnancy and birth outcomes in people with hEDS HSD through a large scale international survey to provide a new understanding of the full range of complications and thereby inform perinatal care and increase obstetric safety Int J Environ Res Public Health of Materials and Methods An online international survey was carried out predominantly collecting quantitative data with additional open ended qualitative questions to allow participants to clarify re sponses Five third party organisations Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists The Better Birth Network Ehlers Danlos Society Hypermobility Syndromes Association and Ehlers Danlos Support UK were involved in the development of this project as partners in the funding application and supported recruitment This was the first part of a larger project that also explored childbearing women and healthcare professionals experiences of perinatal care followed by the co creation of useful tools for implementation in practice Participants recruited were women over the age of years who had given birth after weeks of pregnancy at least once from onwards though participants meeting this criterion could also report on all pregnancies after The timeframe chosen was to ensure that birthing experiences were after the publication of the World Health Organisation recommended interventions for improving maternal and newborn health Participants were required to declare a medical diagnosis of hEDS HSD or an older equivalent diagnosis of EDS Type III EDS Hypermobility Type or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome Inclusion was limited to developed majority native English speaking countries namely UK Ireland USA Canada Australia and New Zealand Participants were recruited through public professional voluntary sector and social media platforms between June and September The survey questions were developed following a review of the available literature in relation to childbearing with hEDS HSD and modified following piloting and ethi cal review e g questions were prioritised to reduce survey length Patient and public involvement PPI was conducted via an online poll and led to the inclusion of certain complications for example premature birth abnormal length of labour birth poor anaes thetic coverage and haemorrhage see Pearce et al for further detail of PPI To facilitate the understanding of terms e g augmentation and induction of labour defini tions were provided to participants and are reported here alongside the results The survey was hosted on Qualtrics software starting with participant information and consent before the completion of the survey Complex survey logic was implemented so participants were not asked to complete inappropriate or unethical questions e g after reporting a miscarriage Participants could withdraw by closing the browser at any time without reason or consequences and they could pause participation by using the Save Later option and return to complete the survey within one week Participants inputted a code of their choice so they could withdraw by emailing the researcher up until the point of data analysis Participants reported their demographics age ethnicity level of education and for each pregnancy the outcome gestational week lengths of birth stages place and mode of birth and then selected which birth complications they had experienced from a list see Table in the results section Participants repeated the questions for each pregnancy since and could provide any further comments about their childbearing experience via an open text box A debrief page was provided signposting participants to sources of information and support Data were analysed with SPSS software using descriptive statistics to two decimal places Data were reviewed to ensure all responses met eligibility criteria and descriptive statistics were calculated for participant demographics Percentage incidences were calcu lated for outcomes and complications e g pre eclampsia pre term birth shoulder dystocia haemorrhages ineffective pain relief Where responses were binary i e experienced or not experienced confidence intervals for proportions were calculated Survey data are pre sented alongside relevant published general population incidences collated where available following literature review to aid interpretation in the context of the study design All qualitative responses were read for familiarity and analysed using conventional content analysis to compliment the quantitative focus and capture additional complications not asked about quantitatively This approach is appropriate when limited literature exists and to analyse alongside descriptive statistics To increase reliability two members Int J Environ Res Public Health of of the research team were collectively involved in coding and analysis with comments coded independently and then discussed with the second researcher GP LB Qualitative codes and associated quotes relating to complications of childbearing were grouped into themes Themes were developed inductively from text rather than from the complications directly asked about in the survey Findings were discussed in light of perinatal care SP and medical expertise with lived experience ER Code frequencies are not reported with findings as qualitative data were collected to supplement quantitative data and cannot infer the prevalence of a complication Any identifiable information in open ended responses was anonymised Results The number of surveys completed was Data for outcomes and complications are based on responses because eight respondents appeared to enter data on four separate pregnancies in one single round of the survey and so were excluded from analysis A total of pregnancies were reported with

breaking and giving birth bladder infection and four people said uterine infection Discussion The aim of this study was to explore the outcomes and complications of pregnancy and birth for people with hEDS HSD A large number of participants completed the survey in a short space of time highlighting the desire for people with hEDS HSD to extend the knowledge base for these conditions via research In summary the results confirmed higher incidences of certain childbearing complications than are typically found in the general population and reports others for the first time These include preterm birth pre eclampsia eclampsia Pre term Rupture of Membranes antepartum haemorrhage postpartum haemorrhage hyperemesis gravidarum shoulder dystocia caesarean wound infection postpartum psychosis PTSD precipitate labour and being born before arrival at intended place of birth Higher incidences are concluded whereby ranges for population incidences fall entirely outside of the confidence intervals found in this study The meaning and implications of these findings are subsequently discussed This study corroborates previous findings with roughly twice the population incidence of preterm birth among people with hEDS HSD In addition this study found higher than typical rates of pre term rupture of membranes a complication associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality alongside additional risks from chorioamnionitis and placental abruption It could be that this fragility of foetal membranes is one of the factors that contributes to the higher incidence of prematurity Findings did not reveal any increased incidence of stillbirth consistent with previous research on JHS Whilst previous research has found a higher rate of miscarriage among people with hEDS than has been reported in the general population this study found no increased incidence Antepartum haemorrhage sometimes caused by placental abruption was higher than would be expected based on population incidences Bleeding is not only a risk in itself but placental abruption has been associated with pre eclampsia with both eclampsia and pre eclampsia reported at much higher rates in this study than in the general population Identifying risk factors for pre eclampsia e g pre existing hypertension having pre eclampsia in a previous pregnancy is embedded in perinatal care This work suggests that people with hEDS HSD should also be considered as an at risk group It is recommended that findings from this hEDS HSD population are included in future updates of clinical guidelines and that hEDS HSD are embedded in initial pregnancy screening questionnaires Researchers may further investigate the mechanisms that lead to pre eclampsia For example magnesium is one of the important treatments for severe pre eclampsia and eclamptic seizures and magnesium depletion has been anecdotally linked to hEDS Other potential mechanisms could relate to mast cell degradation products causing issues with placental vasculature blood flow or clotting or the potential role of natural killer cells in pre eclampsia recurrent pregnancy loss and implantation failure A much higher than typical number of participants reported a precipitate labour consistent with previous smaller hEDS HSD studies This finding may help to explain the higher proportion of babies born before arrival at the intended place of birth and warrants further longitudinal research to unearth the reasons and order of events Labours of h or less are strongly associated with higher risks of maternal complications including cervical and grade perineal tears post partum haemorrhage retained placenta and prolonged hospitalisation These risks are also important to include in perina tal care considerations particularly given potential issues with wound healing and local anaesthetic for people with hEDS HSD although the incidence of ineffective local anaesthetic in this study was lower than previously found in dental care research Prolonged latent phases of labour may quickly progress into fast active labours and births Int J Environ Res Public Health of for people with hEDS HSD with the subsequent risk that births are unattended by profes sionals This outcome may contribute to a more negative birthing experience as well as contribute to explaining the higher prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse vaginal wall or womb It should also be noted that participants in this study were only asked to report prolapses occurring in the first weeks following birth whereas prolapses are often not recognised until much later To mitigate the potential risk of pelvic organ prolapse when episiotomy is clinically indicated some authors have suggested that caesarean section may be preferred though with its own risks This study reports caesarean wound infection incidences as higher than the available population incidences Slow healing was one of the most reported complications by however comparison to the general population is lacking and more research is required Shoulder dystocia was reported at a much higher incidence than the population aver age The known risk factors are maternal diabetes body mass index over age over gestational age after weeks instrumental vaginal birth and epidural although its occurrence is still often unpredictable These findings indicate that hEDS HSD may be another risk factor to consider and is therefore recommended to be considered in the next revisions of the guidance on shoulder dystocia The McRobert s Manoeuvre is commonly recommended as first line treatment however this can result in mater nal pubic symphysis diastasis and other potential pelvic and hip injury The Gaskin Manoeuvre in a hands and knees position has recently been found to be a safer first line method reducing injury to the baby This could be considered a better first option for people with hEDS HSD warranting further research Postpartum haemorrhage was reported to be three times more common among sur veyed participants than the general population incidence This has profound impact as a leading cause of maternal death often caused by failure of the uterus to contract back adequately after birth genital tract trauma or retained placenta As hEDS HSD has been linked to Mast Cell Activation syndrome MCAS this finding might align with the theory that people with MCAS are more at risk of post partum haemorrhage because of endogenous heparin release from mast cells or enhanced fibrinolysis driven by activated mast cells There is an overlap of reported birth complications between hEDS HSD and MCAS and therefore treatments for MCAS e g identifying and removing environmental triggers and the use of mast cell stabilisers and antihistamines may be indicated alongside mainstream perinatal care Research and recognition of MCAS in pregnancy is currently lacking yet it is believed to impact million pregnancies worldwide annually This study supports the clear need for further examination of this complex interplay Although nausea and vomiting are estimated to occur in of pregnancies a much higher incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum was reported in this hEDS HSD popu lation compared to the general population hEDS HSD has been referred to as a trifecta with MCAS and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction such as Postural orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome PoTS because of high rates of co occurrence between these conditions Given that there is also an increased risk of hyperemesis gravidarum in women with PoTS potential mechanisms might involve a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system Hyperemesis gravidarum is a prominent cause of emergency de partment visits and hospitalisation in pregnancy and so this finding highlights the importance of diagnosing hEDS HSD supporting knowledge among perinatal staff and investigating the possible mechanisms implicated e g Mast Cells thereby potentially developing novel treatments Several studies have reported that people with hEDS HSD do not feel listened to contributing to traumatic experiences in maternity and healthcare services Post traumatic stress disorder PTSD was reported by almost in people in this study consistent with the prevalence of PTSD previously found among high risk groups e g women who experienced an emergency caesarean section or a difficult traumatic or pre term birth Post partum psychosis was also notably higher in this hEDS HSD Int J Environ Res Public Health of population at nearly compared with an estimated global prevalence of in to births Further research that investigates this finding could facilitate advances in knowledge about the causes and treatments of this serious and distressing condition with consideration needed as to whether individuals with hEDS HSD ought to be included in existing monitoring systems Strengths Limitations and Implications These data cover a large number of pregnancies N in over six countries and three continents inclusive of up to date diagnostic criteria for hEDS HSD Population health surveys are useful for estimating condition prevalence and this research specif ically provides novel insights into perinatal complications and outcomes that may need additional considerations by contextualising them with reported incidences in the general population Comparison statistics were chosen with preference given to recently published large empirical studies reviews or guidelines from a similar context e g high income country and international variation in outcomes such as gestational age have been re ported However comparator data were not available for all complications or nations and these statistics cannot be interpreted as a control group This examination does provide a clear need for future investigation for example to collect and analyse large scale coded data to document longitudinal childbearing journeys with hEDS HSD and to consider potential mechanisms for these associations The eligibility criteria and self selection of volunteer participants should be considered in the context of the findings being based on retrospective self report data To reduce recall bias and sit within current guidance the cut off year for pregnancies was however this means that the maternity history provided may only be partial for some individuals Although participants reporting a birth after weeks could report miscarriages individuals who have only experienced miscarriages were not eligible to take part Regarding fertility a planned conception of pregnancy within months was lower than has been reported in the general population and findings by nature do not include individuals who have never conceived Varying lengths of latent labour were reported by participants with some reporting latent labour for much of their pregnancy which might be better characterised as an irritable uterus Some participants found it difficult to distinguish between the defined latent and active stages of labour and so responses were reliant on the participant s recall Further prospective research would be beneficial to objectively document the pregnancy and birth experiences of people with hEDS HSD The interpretation of the data should also be considered in light of the sample demo graphics The sample population was more highly educated than average and aspects e g cycle length that may impact fertility were not measured The majority of participants were white therefore the findings of this study may not represent the experiences of people of other ethnicities in the included countries This may have occurred because of the recruitment methods used and future work should consider how to achieve a sample that is more reflective of the whole population Availability and analysis of accurate record data including improved diagnosis and recording of hEDS HSD is needed Future statistical research may also consider the role of comorbid conditions and factors such as childbearing age or weight The word woman was used during recruitment which led to us being contacted by people who have experienced childbearing but do not identify as cisgender women and therefore felt excluded from the research We did not collect gender demographics within this survey and so cannot say that all who took part were cisgender women but this potential lack of representation for childbearing people as a whole group should be considered Following this feedback further research was carried out to examine perinatal care for trans and non binary birthing people The majority of reported births occurred in obstetric units This can typically be be cause of planned or emergency caesareans or to manage birth complications or high risk Int J Environ Res Public Health of pregnancies It is important to note however that people with hEDS HSD should not automatically be considered to have a high risk pregnancy because of the wide heterogene ity in clinical presentation with positive experiences and favourable birth outcomes also reported Many people with hEDS HSD can still experience an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth and should not be discouraged from birthing their babies vaginally where appropriate As with every pregnant person planning of perinatal care should be based on the individual s situation risks and wishes Recommendations from this research focus on updating the awareness of possible complications and outcomes in healthcare guidance and on including hEDS HSD in initial perinatal screening questionnaires to ensure appropriate consultation and monitoring The aim should now be to increase ed ucation preparation and available support for people with hEDS HSD and perinatal staff in order to reduce the risk of complications potentially causing an exacerbation into higher levels of disability This is examined further in the second part of this programme of research and information on the research programme can be found on this website for public dissemination of research www hEDStogether com Conclusions These data cover a large number of pregnancies N over six countries and three continents inclusive of up to date diagnostic criteria for hEDS HSD This research draws us closer to understanding how pregnancy and birth complications may be linked to hEDS HSD This is within the context of the recent understanding that in births could be affected with many people with hEDS HSD being undiagnosed The findings from this study have highlighted that the following incidences were higher in people with hEDS HSD than the general population preterm birth pre eclampsia eclampsia PROM antepartum haemorrhage postpartum haemorrhage hyperemesis gravidarum shoulder dystocia caesarean wound infection postpartum psychosis PTSD precipitate labour and being born before arrival at intended place of birth These can have profound impacts on perinatal and neonatal outcomes Recommendations include updating healthcare guidance to include awareness of these possible complications and outcomes and including hEDS HSD in initial screening questionnaires of perinatal care to ensure that appropriate consultation and monitoring can take place from the start These findings also raise new questions about the aetiology of certain perinatal complications which could lead us to a better understanding of causes and therefore treatment options for some serious and

Res Public Health doi org ijerph www mdpi com journal ijerph Int J Environ Res Public Health of Although hEDS HSD were previously understood to be rare more recent evidence suggests these conditions may be more common In a study of healthcare records in people were found to have a diagnosis of either EDS or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome JHS on their medical records where individuals previously diagnosed with JHS may now be described as having hEDS or HSD Given that hEDS HSD are also believed to be underdiagnosed potential proxy measures of joint hypermobility and chronic pain have been reported with a prevalence of Accounting for population and birth rates it has then been estimated that of all births may be affected by hEDS HSD Thus far the management of hEDS HSD during the perinatal period can be inadequate due to insufficient awareness of these conditions and a lack of diagnosis impeding care and access to appropriate treatment This can result in perceived hostility and disinterest creating help seeking anxiety and clinician associated traumatisation that can lead to worse but preventable health outcomes In particular pregnant people living with hEDS HSD and parents of children with hEDS HSD have reported feeling discredited and unsupported by health professionals Women with hEDS HSD have per ceived that midwives portrayed a sense of panic when trying to support them while lacking knowledge of the conditions While this qualitative study which included childbear ing women with hEDS HSD reported perceptions of inadequate professional knowledge the actual level of knowledge and understanding about hEDS HSD among maternity staff remains unknown and would benefit from larger mixed methods research By including professionals supporting pregnant people in hEDS HSD research new perceptions could indicate how they could be better supported to deliver higher quality and safer care for those with hEDS HSD Additionally this research not only aimed to identify the potential challenges currently faced in this field but also to develop solutions through the co creation of tools to help staff support people with hEDS HSD through their childbearing journey This is the second part of a programme of research examining childbearing and hEDS HSD with the first part examining the incidences of pregnancy and birth complications and outcomes Materials and Methods This research implements a mixed methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data in complimentary synthesis followed by a co creative methodology to build upon these findings The research is comprised of three parts patient and public involvement two online international surveys and the co creation of three tools to support people childbearing with hEDS HSD Five third party organisations Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists The Better Birth Network Ehlers Danlos Society Hypermobility Syndromes Association and Ehlers Danlos Support UK were involved in the development of this project partners in the funding application supported recruitment as gatekeepers and partook in co creation activities GRIPP was utilised for reporting PPI in this research Supplementary Table S Previously hEDS HSD were named EDS Type III EDS Hypermobility Type and Joint Hypermobility Syndrome The current study examines and refers to hEDS HSD inclusive of these previous diagnoses and nomenclature Part Patient and Public Involvement A poll was created and advertised publicly through the blog of the Academic Midwife www sallypezaro wordpress com over professional social media accounts It openly asked members of the public to answer questions about topics and tools important and relevant to childbearing and hEDS HSD to inform what questions should be included in the surveys part and potential tools to be co created part Part Online International Surveys Two online international surveys were completed simultaneously by women with experience of childbearing and a diagnosis of hEDS HSD and maternity profession Int J Environ Res Public Health of als Quantitative data were collected with additional open ended qualitative questions to allow participants to clarify their responses All participants were English speaking and over the age of years old residing across the United Kingdom UK Ireland the United States of America USA Canada Australia or New Zealand Chosen countries have been included as they are considered developed and the majority are native English speaking countries Inclusion criteria and recruitment of people with childbearing experience are detailed in Pearce et al Maternity professionals included any health care professionals providing care to childbearing people Eligibility was open to enable the professional participant group to be multidisciplinary in nature and advertised to a range of professions for example midwifery obstetrics physiotherapy anaesthetists EDS related specialists and complimentary therapies Participants did not need to have experience with or knowledge of hEDS HSD to participate All participants were recruited through public professional and third sector platforms Our recruitment ads were shared times and were viewed by social media users Additionally paid promotion was utilised on Twitter and Facebook platforms to target a range of healthcare professionals for the staff survey only The survey was hosted on Qualtrics software starting with participant information and consent tick boxes to ensure informed consent was received before participants could complete the survey Participants with hEDS HSD completed questions about their ex periences in relation to receiving maternity care Maternity staff were asked questions in relation to their experiences practices knowledge and understandings in relation to the delivery of care to childbearing people with hEDS HSD Both groups were asked to reflect on priorities for the development of future research and interventions to support the delivery of safer and higher quality maternity care for this unique population A debrief signposting participants to sources of information and support was provided Participants could withdraw by closing the browser at any time without reason or consequences and could pause participation by using the Save Later option and return to complete the survey within one week Participants inputted a code of their choice that they could use to withdraw by emailing the researcher up until the point of data analysis Any identifiable data collected via open ended responses were anonymised For childbearing participants with hEDS HSD the Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire GSPEQ assessed their experiences of maternity care via a point Likert scale Responses were changed from clinicians to maternity staff as the questionnaire was designed to ask questions about staff providing most of the maternity care Participants also completed questions about their demographics outcomes and complications with these results reported elsewhere For maternity professionals descriptive information was gathered about the member of staff s role and country of residence along with the length and setting in which they practice Questions were asked in relation to the members of staff s awareness confidence and decision making with regards to caring for childbearing people with hEDS HSD The findings were synthesised using a mixed methods approach with quantitative findings used to underpin qualitative themes Open ended qualitative responses were analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis After authors G P and L B read the data multiple times semantic codes were created for all the data and grouped collectively for both participant groups into sub themes and then themes L B These were collaboratively discussed reflected and revised to ensure they were data driven and defined with GP and sense checked for meaning and relevance to the field of perinatal services with SP Illustrative quotations are provided in the prose with full details of quotations to themes provided in Supplementary Table S These are fully anonymised to protect participant identities Descriptive statistics related to experience are embedded within the qualitative themes An ANOVA was undertaken to examine whether there was a significant difference in experience of care depending on when a diagnosis of hEDS HSD was received An a priori power calculation using G Power determined a minimum of participants was needed to achieve a power of and a medium effect size for each Int J Environ Res Public Health of of the surveys The data collection highly exceeded that minimum and these data met parametric and homogeneity assumptions Part Co Creation of Tools Underpinned by participatory action research and a design thinking ap proach the three co s framework of co define co design and co refine was used to identify the best tools to be developed what should be included in the tools and refine prototypes towards final outputs Co creators were viewed as co researchers and invited from gatekeeper and researcher networks with experience of hEDS HSD and or childbearing including PPI members healthcare professionals who support childbearing people third sector representatives researchers and designers see acknowledgements for list of co creators Two online workshops were hosted using Big Blue Button software for co creators to actively annotate the screen with ideas and engage in the co creation process The first workshop included co define activities with an icebreaker to introduce who everyone was and why they wanted to be involved feedback on the PPI poll and discussion of what problems needed to be solved and therefore what maternity tools could be created A consensus was reached on which three tools should be created These were co designed together The core team of Coventry University academics G P S P and P M and BenClarkDesign www benclarkdesign co uk worked together to create prototypes of the three identified tools These were presented and discussed for co refinement in the second workshop and finalised with the five third sector organisations Results Part Patient and Public Involvement The PPI poll was closed after it received votes Those who engaged voted for staff to be asked about awareness knowledge and confidence in supporting people childbearing with hEDS HSD Therefore these elements were focused on in the survey part The top voted tools to help staff support people childbearing with hEDS HSD included an online learning module guidelines leaflets a decision making resource and an infographic or video The results of these PPI activities were used to inform the first co creation workshop part Part Online International Surveys Participants exceeded recruitment aims N with hEDS HSD total pregnancies maternity staff N Most professionals were from the midwifery profession including midwives senior midwives student midwives consultant midwives and nurse midwives A few were professionals in obstetrics with eleven consultant obstetricians five obstetric registrars three obstetric nurses and one junior obstetrician Only were anaesthetists four consultants and two juniors and the remaining included physiotherapists paramedics osteopaths chiropractors paediatric nurses and lactation consultants a GP a qualified theatre scrub practitioner a sonographer a rheuma tologist and a cardiac nurse The countries where the professionals were based spanned across the UK Australia Canada USA New Zealand and Ireland Settings of practice were mainly in obstetric units community settings midwifery led units specialist clinics and birth centres with the remaining settings including antenatal and postnatal clinics general practice GP units ambulance services academia and private care Descriptive statistics for participants with hEDS HSD are provided in Pearce et al There were two inductively developed themes from the thematic analysis centred on the recognition of hEDS HSD and the delivery of perinatal care Table Quotations from participants with hEDS HSD are accompanied by their diagnosis and country in square brackets and professionals are indicated by their role and country Int J Environ Res Public Health of Table Outline of themes and sub themes

care for people with hEDS HSD individualised perinatal care Subtheme Reducing trauma and improving experiences Theme Recognising hEDS HSD in Perinatal Care The first theme was about the recognition of hEDS HSD in perinatal care with sub themes on building professional knowledge developing evidence based resources and improving diagnoses of hEDS HSD Subtheme Building Professional Knowledge of hEDS HSD Many women reported that professionals often had limited awareness and knowledge of hEDS HSD I had to tell every nurse I worked with what it was and how it affected me EDS Type III UK Some had been cared for by knowledgeable specialists or professionals who actively sought to develop their understanding Midwife was not aware of hEDS prior to my treatment but took the time to research and shared valuable insight with me hEDS UK Few professionals perceived that hEDS HSD awareness had recently grown In my hospital EDS is a new word people are now mentioning it but a year ago it was unheard of Midwife UK However professionals also reported that misconceptions towards hEDS HSD were held by colleagues Many people I have spoken to seem to believe that hypermobility would be an advantage in labour and fail to acknowledge the added pain or tissue damage that could be caused Midwife UK Taken together professionals frequently described wanting more knowledge of hEDS HSD including about symptoms and care management More awareness of the condition and associated complications Senior Midwife UK Participants with hEDS HSD quantitatively reported that they perceived the profes sionals to have a somewhat low level of knowledge about hEDS HSD with maternity support workers midwives and obstetric nurses perceived as mainly not at all knowledge able Table Physiotherapists were viewed as the most knowledgeable albeit still on the lower end of somewhat knowledgeable None of the professions providing care for child bearing people were rated on the higher end of the scale as mostly or very knowledgeable about hEDS HSD Table How knowledgeable each maternity professional was perceived to be about hEDS HSD in order of most knowledgeable to least Knowledge Scaled from to with Being Not at All Mean SD CI Knowledgeable and Being Very Knowledgeable Physiotherapists Obstetricians Anaesthetists General practitioners GPs Obstetric nurses Midwives Maternity support workers When asked of staff did not consider themselves to be knowledgeable on hEDS HSD Out of those that did consider themselves to have knowledge of hEDS HSD the main sources of knowledge were professional N and personal N experi ence followed by reading research N and seeing it in the media N Very few Int J Environ Res Public Health of gained their source of knowledge from university courses N or other types of training N Subtheme Developing Evidence Based Guidelines and Accessible Training Resources Both childbearing women and professionals identified a current lack of relevant train ing resources I tried to research EDS in pregnancy and material was hard to come by EDS Type III UK Both participant groups also wanted an increase in evidence based guidelines to inform appropriate care We need more information that will allow the discontinuation of rapidly dissolving sutures in women with EDS and the potential link with severe vaginal prolapse postpartum Consultant Obstetrician UK Professionals wanted a range of resources including professional guidelines toolkits online courses and posters though resources should be based on research a study published to provide the advice that I can pass on to the planning expectant mother Rheumatologist EDS Specialist New Zealand It was important that resources were easily accessible including in multiple languages and that profession als had capacity in their roles to learn that information is no good if we do not have enough time to access absorb or implement it Midwife UK Quantitively when asked what resources professionals would find most useful the main seven starting with the highest ranked were clinical guidance N online course N clinical decision making tree N maternity toolkit N infographic N leaflet N and online information sources like webinars blogs Twitter feeds and online health learning boards N Other suggestions across four participants included professional articles access to hEDS HSD patients and caregivers and incorporating into existing resources like the Altered Health Module One participant highlighted the importance of the involvement of all major stakeholders in the development of resources This information was fed into part of the co creation workshops Although the request for clinical guidance was the highest most had not read the published care considerations available n because they were not aware of them n The survey appeared to act as an invention in itself because some N said they read it during the survey itself and others added a qualitative comment that they would read it later now that the survey had raised their awareness For those who had read the care considerations before survey participation N they commented that they found it useful for developing a better care plan discussing it with women to empower them to be the experts and be heard sharing with peers being aware of the implications of this condition and increasing knowledge and confidence to support and create individual plans with people with hEDS HSD One participant was concerned that the care considerations focused on risk and lack of individuality which puts pressure on midwives to refer all women on to a high risk pathway regardless of the woman s past experiences It will put fear into midwives when women with hEDS ask for support to birth outside of a consultant led unit These comments highlight the impact some research in the field has already achieved and may have in the future Subtheme Improving Diagnosis of hEDS HSD The experiences of participants with hEDS HSD were impacted by whether they had been diagnosed with hEDS HSD prior to pregnancy or not Some felt that a diagnosis would have improved appropriate care If I was diagnosed we may have been able to take certain precautions hEDS Canada Participants also often reported that in hindsight hEDS HSD symptoms were present during their pregnancy birth or postpartum and some described a worsening of their hEDS HSD symptoms I experienced my first joint subluxation hip in the last trimester of pregnancy and then became very symptomatic in the year after my child was born EDS Type III USA Therefore some with hEDS HSD suggested that professionals are well positioned to identify hEDS HSD in those undiagnosed I saw a number of physios etc and not one realised I was hypermobile despite being bed bound for a lot of my nd and rd trimesters JHS UK Some professionals also estimated that they had Int J Environ Res Public Health of unknowingly cared for those with hEDS HSD I have probably looked after women with this condition and was not aware that this was the cause of their symptoms Midwife Australia Overall most professionals M years providing care range years high lighted quantitatively that they had heard of some form of hEDS HSD EDS Type III EDS Hypermobility Type or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome with not having heard of any of the listed conditions and having heard of all of them When asked how many pregnancies they thought were associated with hEDS HSD each year most thought it was rare with either in or in thought it was in with only a small percentage thinking it was more common at in or in Theme Delivering Appropriate and Individualised Perinatal Care The second theme was focused on the delivery of care for childbearing people with hEDS HSD with sub themes on listening and believing what people with hEDS HSD are saying to professionals co ordinating care for these multi system conditions better across multiple professionals and disciplines and as a result improving care and reducing the potentially traumatic experiences that people with hEDS HSD can have Subtheme Listening to and Believing Individuals Collaborative and individual led care were considered crucial for good perinatal care Many with hEDS HSD felt that staff had dismissed their symptoms or not believed their labour progression I gave birth in the car park on my own because they did not believe I was in labour hEDS Ireland A lack of trust in these personal bodily experiences sometimes led to increased risks complications or traumas including pain I was still not believed when I said the epidural was not working I then told them correctly which ones toes they touched EDS Type III UK Some professionals also highlighted the value of learning from people with hEDS HSD when co creating guidelines and care plans particularly because of the diverse nature of hEDS HSD EDS presents differently in every woman communication is key It is essential to believe women when they report unusual symptoms and not to fob them off because it does not fit in a box Senior Midwife Ireland Relatedly women frequently described having to advocate for themselves amidst a lack of professional understanding of hEDS HSD Professionals who had hEDS HSD themselves often felt better placed to advocate for EDS informed care I am a registered nurse I was well researched and advocated for the care I needed EDS Type III USA Overall quantitative GSPEQ scores for childbearing women s experiences of care were mixed Table Tertiles showed an even spread with a third of participants with hEDS HSD having a negative experience overall a third considering their experience to be neither negative nor positive and a third experiencing positive care The GSPEQ scored a very

Perinatal Care for People with hEDS HSD Care coordination across professionals and disciplines ensured that information about an individual s hEDS HSD was effectively communicated to inform care Professionals knowledgeable about hEDS HSD often played an important role The OB obstetrician who was a geneticist was a strong advocate for me She made all the difference with my medical team EDS Type III USA However some participants received care during birth that was not delivered according to care plans My notes about EDS and my birth plan written by the doctors were ignored and led to complications EDS Hypermobility Type UK Professionals often because of a lack of confidence in their understanding wanted referral pathways to specialists or hEDS HSD informed professionals Good signposting when women present with conditions that are outside of our sphere of competence and knowledge Student Midwife UK Similarly those childbearing with hEDS HSD described that other professionals should have been involved in their care for example physiotherapy I wish that discharge included a referral for physical therapy hEDS USA and mental health teams the maternity carers were completely focused on the baby and not my mental health due to the immense pain I was in JHS New Zealand Restrictions on some health systems were noted For example insurance based systems could limit exploration of health issues beyond pregnancy My insurance was for pregnancy only so they were unable to address my care even if they wanted to hEDS USA Quantitatively the professionals most frequently rated feeling not at all confident in relation to providing effective care identifying symptoms referring and forming a care plan Most often professionals were only slightly confident that other colleagues were providing good care Table Table Maternity staff confidence levels to provide care to people with hEDS HSD How Confident Would You Be to Not at All Slightly Moderately Very Provide effective care Identify symptoms Refer Form a care plan Colleagues provide good care Additionally there was no significant difference F p in experience of care in relation to whether people with hEDS HSD first conceived before diagnosis M SD after M SD or in the same year M SD Subtheme Reducing Trauma and Improving Experiences Participants with hEDS HSD reported varied experiences that differed across their pregnancies and interactions with different professionals Positive experiences encom passed compassionate person centred and knowledgeable care The midwives who deliv ered my baby were extremely calming welcoming helpful and understanding A couple of midwives in the aftercare made me feel quite silly regarding my hEDS even though they did not know what it was hEDS UK Inadequate professional knowledge of hEDS HSD and inappropriate or harmful care contributed to trauma anxiety and depression I am pregnant again and am terrified have PTSD and cannot attend the hospital I birthed in hEDS UK As well as avoiding specific professionals or hospitals some participants had made birthing choices based on fear of inadequate professional understanding One of the reasons for my second pregnancy is that I am opting for a planned C section because of how terrified I am of people not knowing how to help me JHS UK Some had also chosen not to become pregnant again I will never risk pregnancy and childbirth again because women with hEDS are not given the healthcare services they need hEDS Australia Trauma also contributed to longer term issues with physical and emotional health and relational problems with infant or partner bonding Int J Environ Res Public Health of as a result of their actions not only did I almost die I have never been able to have the relationship with my son I desperately want to have EDS Type III Australia Part Co Creation of Tools In the first workshop three key needs were identified as a focus of the co creation a need to educate professionals supporting perinatal care about hEDS HSD a need to support shared decision making between childbearing people with hEDS HSD and pro fessionals and a need to raise awareness more generally in the public about hEDS HSD and childbearing Although the need for guidelines had also been highlighted it was acknowledged that published care considerations already existed so it was more important to raise awareness and educate people about their existence and main messages A key challenge was identified as wanting to raise the profile by emphasising the importance that professionals understand hEDS HSD and childbearing while also not wanting to put people off childbearing with hEDS HSD Linked to this was the challenge of explaining hEDS HSD care considerations as a whole and in a simple publicly accessible way while also highlighting the different potential presentations and considerations of supporting people with hEDS HSD For example some people do not respond to local anaesthesia while others do Three tools were decided following discussion The first was in response to the highest voted educational tool in the PPI poll an online learning module and would address the first identified need of helping professionals learn how to support childbearing people with hEDS HSD This could be developed as an accredited and professional i learn module through the Royal College of Midwives A prototype short learning course was co designed with learning objectives information to be provided key resources and signposting The second agreed output was to address the need for shared decision making by developing a one page freely downloadable tool for perinatal records A prototype was co designed to include key information about hEDS HSD considerations that maternity professionals and people with hEDS HSD may want to consider together and a section to write about aspects unique to that childbearing person and how support could be tailored for them It features a direct picture from the co created annotations in Big Blue Button where one co creator wrote Parents and staff making decisions together and other co creators drew ticks heart shapes and yes around it The third agreed upon output was to address the final need of raising public awareness by creating a freely accessible infomercial about hEDS HSD and childbearing The idea was co designed for a person with hEDS HSD to speak about their experience a midwife to talk about key care considerations and then to show them making shared decisions together BenClarkDesign was commissioned to create the infomercial as part of a team including an animator voiceover actress and videographer see acknowledgement for details Positive feedback was provided in the co refine sessions with co creators providing annotations directly to the software as well as discussing their thoughts It was agreed that the tool for perinatal records Figure would feature in the infomercial hosted on the Coventry University YouTube channel and i learn module hosted on the Royal College of Midwives website and the infomercial would be in the i learn module too The agreed improvements were applied and the final versions of the three tools are also hosted on the www hEDStogether com research dissemination website Int J Environ Res Public Health of I nt J Environ Res Public Health of Figure Tool for perinatal

the need identified for a clearer current diagnosis and treatment more people will be diagnosed and more professionals will have increased knowledge and In the future and with the use of the co created tools the hope is that as understand confidence on how to support people with hEDS HSD ing improves more people will be diagnosed and more professionals will have increased Qualitatively the second major theme was around delivering appropriate and indi knowledge and confidence on how to support people with hEDS HSD vidualised perinatal care The sub theme relating to a need to be listened to and believed corroborates research across other healthcare provision with novelty added to Int J Environ Res Public Health of the field with the sub themes about coordinating appropriate care for childbearing peo ple with hEDS HSD and reducing trauma and improving experiences It is of note that some professionals who did not know about the conditions commented that they were not aware of potential complications during pregnancy and birth and implications in the postpartum period such as infant feeding This corroborates previous qualitative research with people with hEDS HSD while adding novelty from the professional s perspective Additionally there was a potential miscommunication highlighted where professionals felt they were providing an opportunity for people with hEDS HSD to explain their condition but this was interpreted as the need for tedious repetition by multiple professionals with a lack of knowledge Clearer communication is therefore recommended about the desire to listen and tailor care for the individual and the co created tool for perinatal records provides a stimulus for this to occur Where professionals did have knowledge about the condition and were able to advocate for the person with hEDS HSD or were prepared to actively research and learn about the condition this was felt to provide a positive experi ence When this was not the case some reported that it led to complications that could have been avoided There were concerns expressed in both the survey and co creation that when raising awareness among professionals the emphasis could focus too much on the risks of the conditions It was considered important that the co created outputs and public messaging were not aimed at putting people off childbearing and did not provide the impression that all people with hEDS HSD are the same and that all should be considered high risk pregnancies because this is not the case Although higher risks have been identified with a need for monitoring in cases of a need for higher risk consultant led care in some cases actions taken as a result of being considered to have a high risk pregnancy could actually cause more harm For example serial cervical length screening examining the theory of cervical insufficiency because of abnormal cervical collagen in people with hEDS HSD has not been shown to decrease the incidence of pre term birth However cervical cerclage placement can increase the risk of tearing in connective tissue disorders People with hEDS HSD should not be discouraged from birthing their babies vagi nally Birthing environments that support spontaneous pushing optimal positioning and joint support are encouraged to avoid unnecessary trauma to joints and ligaments Promoting calm and relaxation is highly valuable and helps to naturally stimulate hormones conducive to birth such as oxytocin and endorphins Additionally oxytocin can provide a beneficial antidiuretic effect for people with PoTS Midwife led care during labour and birth promotes non pharmacological pain management resulting in lower med icalisation and intervention especially if the healthcare professional is well informed about hEDS HSD This can help to reduce possible hEDS HSD related complications and problematic post partum symptoms such as prolapse from episiotomy coccyx dislocation pubic symphysis diastasis from McRobert s manoeuvre PTSD and poor wound healing and infection from rd th degree tears episiotomy and cae sarean sections Additionally potential issues with anaesthesia may be able to be avoided such as ineffective local anaesthesia issues with cervical spine instability CSF leak risk from epidural and hypotension from anaesthesia However for people with PoTS presenting with hypotension causing peripheral vasodilation phenyle phrine epidural may prevent reactive tachycardia Precipitate labour suspected to be due to laxity meaning easier passage through the pelvis can reduce the chance of instrumental birth and associated risks Ideally for the benefit of both professionals and those childbearing with hEDS HSD perinatal staff would be more prepared for this to occur in people with hEDS HSD and thus better able to avoid births occurring outside of their intended location potentially with a plan in place for home birth as appropriate or as a contingency Int J Environ Res Public Health of Strengths and Limitations These were large international surveys representing a range of diagnoses related to hEDS HSD and professions A high number of people took part especially in the PPI activities and particularly people with hEDS HSD as hundreds participated from the first tweet h This highlights a distinct appetite for these conditions to be researched and supported in healthcare The inclusion of a range of countries provided a depth of experience often highlighting key similarities in issues such as the need to feel listened to and coordinate maternity care to improve experiences However differences in healthcare provision also need to be considered within this context for example issues with insurance coverage do not apply across all included countries Additionally this was a self report questionnaire with the potential for sampling bias from those that wish to have their voices and opinions heard about hEDS HSD both as people who have had children and perinatal staff A third of childbearing people with hEDS HSD reported a negative experience overall a third neither negative nor positive and a third experienced positive care It is worth noting that some participants reported in their qualitative comments that they found this question difficult to answer because they have experienced variation across their care either within the same pregnancy or across different pregnancies In this self report questionnaire sampling bias presents a limitation For example healthcare professionals with experience with hEDS HSD personally or professionally may have been more likely to complete the questions The recruitment approach aimed to mitigate this by sharing the questionnaire broadly and clarifying that no knowledge or experience of the conditions was necessary to take part Similarly one limitation was the relatively low number of participants from some professional groups in the study e g anaesthesiologists and so the results from these groups cannot be extrapolated to the wider profession s population This study used a mixed methods questionnaire with qualitative responses used to illustrate and provide completeness to quantitative data In this way it is recognised that participant interviews were not implemented to gain in depth insight from each participant and the aim of this survey was instead focused on reaching a broader population following previous interview research The use of a mixed methods survey approach helped to build upon previously published literature and ensure that the findings could be triangulated and synthesised together in a complimentary way to build up a well rounded picture leading to strong co created outputs Patient and public involvement was important to this research from the beginning informing focus design and outputs The international vision for PPI identified key PPI barriers which have been successfully addressed within this research For example public awareness and communication were increased through our established networks and the engagement hubs of hEDS Together and the academic midwife co creators were acknowledged where consent was provided consistency was increased through the use of the three co s framework and the authorship team included those with lived experience of hEDS HSD and of childbearing parenthood as well as being multidisciplinary across health psychology midwifery and design The co creation not only included patients and the public but also other key stakeholders that could provide barriers or facilitate the success of the outputs including third sector organisations healthcare professionals academics and designers The online and creative nature of the co creation workshops helped provide a neutral environment where everyone s voice was considered equal and inclusive for those who could not attend in person due to disability time or travel constraints In this article the terms that were used during participant recruitment have been included for consistency for example women and maternity However we are grateful to the people who contacted us during the study highlighting that this language excludes trans and non binary people who have given birth We have responded to this and used alternate inclusive language for example perinatal where appropriate Although many of these experiences may be transferable to the trans and non binary communities with hEDS HSD for example not being listened to and professional lack of awareness we acknowledge that because the language of women was used in recruitment their Int J Environ Res Public Health of experiences will not be fully represented here Additional research was conducted to consider perinatal care for trans and non binary people separately Implications The three co created tools provide highly applicable outputs for use in both education and practice and could help to raise the profile of the current published care considera tions However further work needs to be carried out to raise the profile of the developing evidence base further into guidelines such as with the Ehlers Danlos Society and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence These would need to incorporate the additional knowledge from this current paper and the linked publication on outcomes and complications The developed i learn module for members of the Royal College of Midwives can now also be expanded on a larger scale for example into university curriculum for trainee professionals and a publicly accessible Massive Online Learning Course MOOC for Continued Professional Development CPD of healthcare profession als caring for childbearing people Further research would be useful to objectively examine cohorts of childbearing people to more accurately assess the prevalence of hEDS HSD accessing these services and more fully understand how perinatal staff and childbearing people can work together to increase the positive experience and safety sought by World Health Organisation policy This could specifically include further examination of the use of Vicryl rapide and increased severe postpartum vaginal prolapse observed by one of the consultants who participated in this research There is also the potential for training and evaluating the use of specialist hEDS HSD midwives as front line givers of care and hubs of knowledge for other perinatal professionals like the current models of diabetes and epilepsy care for example Conclusions This mixed methods research is the first to examine professionals knowledge and confidence to support childbearing people with hEDS HSD and is complementary to a large international survey examining the experiences of childbearing with hEDS HSD Not only was the research informed by PPI to ensure the focus was meaningful but solutions to the identified problems were then co created to provide applicable outputs to education and practice The online CPD module is hosted officially by the Royal College of Midwives i learn platform for its members and the tool for perinatal records and infomercials is freely and publicly accessible to support shared decision making and raise awareness

Culture City Host volunteer programme effect the volunteers mental wellbeing A qualitative study Maxine Whelan Iman Ghosh Lauren Bell and Oyinlola Oyebode Abstract Background A team of volunteers known as City Hosts were recruited to support UK City of Culture awarded to Coventry City Hosts held various roles facilitating cultural event delivery and promoting a positive experience for visitors This study aimed to i understand how and to what extent the volunteering programme impacted volunteer subjective wellbeing and ii explore the mechanisms of change and intermediate outcomes between volunteering and subjective wellbeing Methods This qualitative study comprised inductive and deductive analysis of data collected through semi structured interviews conducted between December May with City Hosts This was complimented with secondary qualitative analysis of free text responses within Monitoring and Evaluation data collected from City Hosts in surveys conducted in August and November and April Results Approximately City Hosts responded to the free text questions in each survey and completed interviews Analysis of data collected from City Hosts suggested positive wellbeing impacts from volunteering and supported theorised pathways to improved wellbeing Strengths of the City Host programme included i facilitating the full range of mechanisms of change that mediate improved

person I ve I guess I I panic less P and a survey participant always been interested in people so I can t say that s recalled It s great for one s mental well being changed me So I m not really sure I m not really Theoretical mechanisms of change the ways in which any more confident I don t think than I was before wellbeing might be impacted by volunteering were sup P ported by the qualitative data These were i connecting with others ii feeling appreciated iii doing something purposeful and meaningful iv developing and using However most City Hosts reported one or more of these skills and

lovely meet others Country that years and in Country So it was to also make connections with people It s also to to meet ing new people of all new people that are travelling and hear their stories P walks of life and met We we re so good friends and not just ladies There s all of us you know students male female and it s amaz some great fellow ing just getting to meet people again you know Even if it s the hosts or the public out there it s just just hosts too really good It s just like I said it brings me out of my shell and you know it s very uplifting P Feeling appreciated They do little rewards have like sort of shifts you get a bronze award I think there s little things that do It s good to see the make you feel appreciated and I I and I do think any communication from them is always really positive food hot drink offer P too Little measures I think what what s been great some days it s people come up to you and say oh you know you city hosts like this make the you re doing a great job and that s just the general public Which is lovely Or you know they re really apprecia thought of being tive of if they ve asked the way to something or they ve asked you some information about about something outside in the cold that you ve been able to tell them about P for long periods more doable and to feel appreciated Doing something and I just felt afterwards when I got home I just thought well that s just really nice You know those people volunteering for purposeful and They probably needed to have that conversation P city of culture is life meaningful The sense that I ve helped out the people but also the city and the City of Culture and the events and made satisfaction is good event run a lot more smoothly P doing good for others and the community which provides me a natural sense of accomplishment Developing and Oh yes yes it has had in terms of just thinking about what my employment skills are Yeah so that that s made I am also grateful using skills and me think about other job roles that I might be more interested in future Yeah so promoting Coventry or or or for being given the experiences doing doing something along those lines P opportunity to attend Well I I do think as I said before it is important to stay in the world and to and to keep learning I don t think courses such as Dis you are ever too old to learn And you can t not learn because so much is going on And I ve learned more ability Awareness about uh computers the kind of technical side if you like than I knew before But I am more kind of tecchie aware than I was which is really good P Role and group Just proud that you re doing something and like belonging to like a team People that are all together No you I feel our City Host identity get yeah when you re wearing the uniform like you re proud to wear it Like policemen Well no it s real real reputation is strong pride P I am honoured to be The other thing that surprised me is that people if you take the talk time to talk to them and sometimes part of the volunteer because you ve got the uniform on will tell you things they wouldn t have told you otherwise cause I think it ing programme It s has been quite successful and people have got used to seeing us around in our blue uniforms and will come good to be part of a and talk to us now P team whilst doing my bit Enjoyment We have good fun There s a bit of banter most of my working life s been in a factory so I know all about banter I have enjoyed the and um Yeah we ve had some good fun and I ve worked I m working with some nice people And yeah it s just shifts and have at a pleasure to be doing it to be fair P tended a number of enjoyed them all P different events Structure routine It s probably doing me good cause I m trying not to let my studies overtake everything so like my whole week it seemed a great way distraction end becomes like I m working uni and then study all over the weekend So actually it s probably just good to to finally get out of put a few shifts in and just go self care really isn t it P the house and have I think volunteering is a way of being outside yourself for a while and thinking about somebody else So if some purpose to my you you need to be away from the situation you re in uh being that you re retired and on your own or if you re weeks which the pan married and you just want a break from your partner I think it s good to do some volunteering because it takes demic had stopped your mind off of your situation P Exposure to out We ve done a lot of walking around on the shifts so that s always good Lots of lots of steps most of them doors and nature being out in the open air so it s always useful to get out and about P It s nice to actually get out into the fresh air P Role demands You could be a leader or you could be a host You could take responsibility you didn t have to P At some events I feel There was one there was one at the Coventry Cemetery It s good to walk around it and get to see it but then that I do not have you just sitting about doing nothing There was very little footfall on it The lack the lack of things to do at some enough to do or that of the events Like I said you are just basically present it s not a lot of hands on you know it s a bit boring You I am an extra body come out and spend h there you know it s sort of like watching paint dry P Other times I am busy and feel I am helping The latter is preferable Whelan et al BMC Public Health Page of T able continued Theme Quotes from the Interviews Quotes from the surveys Exposure to culture The richness of what I m

Drivers and Barriers Theme Quotes from interviews Quotes from Survey Individual So I initially I mean I completed the application last year before the City of Culture year was awarded but there are circumstances some delays with the training because I had to attend face to face training but I couldn t make the slots And then in the end I ended up doing the online training there was lots of delay in my end cause I couldn t do the face to face training P So ultimately I m having to fit it round whatever work wants so I know some people if they are retired they have a bit more time to add to hundreds of shifts unfortunately I m not in that position P As as I started I got a job So my intention was to be a team leader And because I got work I decided in it you know let me let me first will get priorities in the job and see where that takes me And so I I haven t taken up the role of team leader Because my work as a consultant means that I travel and I can t I can t then commit two things in the week I can only commit weekends P What volunteers I think sometimes when I volunteered before for things sometimes when people know that I am you re willing to give It has been a do how much your time Sometimes there s an expectation great opportunity and how often They want you to give more and more time if they know that you re free and available That s one of the things I like although I haven t about this programme It is very flexible And yeah you can fit it around work and family P done any hosting I didn t go for the Team Leader because I didn t really want the responsibility I just wanted to enjoy the experiences yet I have some Rather than getting involved with dealing with issues you know problems and things So I just decided to do that City booked at the end Host P of the week I really like that I could be anywhere I want I could pick any shifts I want as much time as I want P Um actual volunteering a lot of the time you re not doing a lot Usually the volunteering like we do in other settings is hands on and more um yeah more going on I m doing the vaccine clinics at the moment so we re busy doing that but um with the City of Culture a lot lately is standing about It might be h it s not not doing a lot P Volunteering So probably my biggest sort of like um minus is the is the way that the shifts are given out P Excellent support support and Now the quality of the Team Leaders in the in the Coventry City of Culture is nowhere near the quality is of the Coven from the City Host management try Ambassadors cause they haven t had the training and some of them it didn t even do a shift before they become a team love that Team Leader P there are specific And I cancelled a couple of sessions and the admin team were absolutely fantastic I did tell them the reasons why social events for But they were brilliant and very supportive because they realise it doesn t have to be someone being ill with COVID the Hosts too So in that sense there s no judgment it s just thanks as long as you let them know because that s the most important thing P Within City of Culture people said at the start of December they would investigate the whole matter and report back two months and absolutely nothing P I think that they have done well that if there s been a problem they ve tried to address it P COVID was a tough year from going from being in the office five days a week to going on to furlough Everyone has It has been a great struggled through the pandemic in one shape or form It s not No one s immune no one s not been affected in some way to start get way P ting back into the I ve never once felt unsafe doing it I ve always felt you know the right precautions has been in place And at the spe world socialise cially when you re like outside and stuff and in doing roaming shifts that s definitely sort of you know I don t feel like after covid I m in any sort of danger of catching it and to be fair everybody is sensible even doing City Hosts shifts with various people people sort of say no no we have to do lateral flow tests we have to wear masks P Whelan et al BMC Public Health Page of conversations which captured their personal perspectives

collected through across Coventry helping to build a reputation and the monitoring and evaluation survey allowed us to tri identity angulate our findings with data from a larger sample of There are questions about whether volunteering benefits City Hosts although also unlikely to be representative of people with a range of characteristics and circumstances City Hosts in general These data supported the themes The City Host programme allowed volunteers to found in the interview data We provided participants match their commitments and activities to their available with the opportunity to feedback on our findings and time and energy This was discussed by many as facili received positive feedback including one written com tating their participation in the programme as well as ment in response to the draft study report As a City ensuring that what they were doing fitted in with their Host I think the overall findings closely track my views wider lives This suggests that where other volunteer pro of the programme and anecdotal views from some city grammes can offer flexibility it will promote volunteering hosts I have spoken to so I feel that my views have been for people with a wide range of personal circumstances represented in your research We are aware though that while protecting volunteers from burn out This may many City Hosts did not come forward to take part in an

currently studying at the events local universities and City Hosts who were fully trained We also noted potential barriers to wellbeing ben but did not engage with more than a few shifts This may efits of volunteering Firstly overbooking volunteers or have been in part due to our recruitment strategy in recruiting volunteers without there being clear respon which the advertisement was not seen by them or if seen sibilities for those turning up was something the inter the opportunity to speak about their City Host experi viewees and survey respondents were unhappy about ence did not appeal

evidence related to e cigarette use in pregnancy published from to Subject and Methods Smoking cessation during pregnancy is a key public health focus given associations with adverse health and birth outcomes E cigarettes may facilitate quitting combustible cigarette use during pregnancy A systematic search of online databases MEDLINE CINAHL and PsycINFO was conducted on February Results Thirty seven studies investigating e cigarette use in pregnancy were included in the review the majority of which were of good quality n Included studies reported on one or more of prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy n birth and health related outcomes of e cigarette use during pregnancy n the impact of e cigarette use on smoking cessation behaviours n and attitudes and perceptions around e cigarette use during pregnancy n Prevalence was found to range from to whilst perceptions of e cigarette use during pregnancy were found to be more positive than those towards combustible cigarette use Findings regarding health and birth outcomes were notably mixed and the efficacy of e cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool remains unclear Conclusion The majority of studies published in the last two years were on prevalence of e cigarette use in pregnancy More high quality evidence focusing on the effectiveness of e cigarettes for smoking cessation and the health implications of e cigarette use compared with combustible cigarette use during pregnancy is needed to support the implementation of e cigarettes as a harm reduction approach in practice Keywords e cigarettes pregnancy public health systematic review smoking cessation Abstract word count Manuscript word count Background Smoking tobacco during pregnancy is an established risk factor associated with multiple adverse health outcomes for both mother and baby Shobeiri et al Risks to mothers include increased risk of obstetric complications compromised psychological health micronutrient deficiencies reduced placental blood flow placental abruption and placenta previa Damron KR Shobeiri et al Tuenter et al Wantanabe and Fukuoka whilst risks to babies include miscarriage premature delivery perinatal morbidity and mortality stillbirth low birth weight neonatal and sudden infant death Abraham et al Pineles et al Turner Warwick Around of women in England self reported smoking at the time of delivery in with the prevalence of women smoking during pregnancy closer to on a global scale Health Social Care Information Centre Lange et al McAndrew et al Reducing smoking during pregnancy has been prioritised by the United Kingdom National Health Service Long Term plan through establishing specialist stop smoking support services for pregnant women Public Health England These services aim to achieve a national target of fewer than of women smoking at the time of birth by Statistics from March indicate that the percentage of pregnant women smoking at the time of giving birth has so far only reduced from to NHS Digital It has been difficult to produce effective interventions supporting pregnant women to quit smoking with programmes often relying on Nicotine Replacement Therapies NRTs which have shown limited efficacy as well as low adherence in smoking cessation trials Claire et al The reasons that NRT appears to be less effective in pregnancy remain unclear however it has been suggested that variations in NRT adherence or nicotine metabolism in pregnant women compared to the general population may contribute to this Claire et al One proposed means of harm reduction is offering e cigarettes to women who are pregnant and smoke National Institute of Health and Care Excellence E cigarettes commonly referred to as vapes are battery powered non combustible tobacco products that deliver nicotine and other flavouring chemicals via inhaled aerosol US Department of Health Human Services E cigarettes have been commercially available since the early s Hsu et al Rose et al and evidence from Public Health England commissioned reports using systematic review survey and secondary data analysis methods combined with toxicology analyses suggests that they are less harmful than combustible tobacco cigarettes Goniewicz et al McNeill et al Orr E cigarette use in England in was approximately equating to around million adults using e cigarette products Public Health England Since e cigarettes are the most commonly reported smoking cessation aid in England with more than half of people who formerly smoked in the general population now reported as using e cigarettes on a daily basis Public Health England In people who smoke and are not pregnant e cigarette use is more effective than traditional NRT for smoking cessation Hajek et al Tong et al A Cochrane review reported that e cigarette use significantly improves quit rates with approximately three additional quitters per when e cigarettes were used instead of traditional NRTs and approximately seven additional quitters per when e cigarettes were used instead of non nicotine vaping products Hartmann Boyce et al E cigarettes are being increasingly used as a smoking cessation tool in pregnancy Bowker et al Oncken et al with the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group a coalition of organisations committed to reducing rates of smoking in pregnancy in the UK advocating for the use of e cigarettes as part of smoking cessation in pregnancy services Network The effectiveness and health related safety of e cigarette use to decrease smoking among pregnant women however remains relatively unknown Siu As such a growing number of studies are investigating the efficacy health risks and safety of e cigarette use during pregnancy to inform evidence based clinical practice A systematic review of studies examined e cigarette use during pregnancy in terms of prevalence patterns of use reasons for use efficacy as a smoking reduction cessation tool and health related outcomes Calder et al Overall this review suggested that prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy is similar to that of combustible cigarette use with most pregnant women who use e cigarettes during pregnancy using them as a tool to help reduce or stop smoking combustible cigarettes There was limited evidence suggesting that e cigarette use may have less adverse health related outcomes than combustible cigarette smoking during pregnancy and insufficient data available to draw meaningful conclusions about the patterns of use and efficacy of e cigarette use as smoking cessation tool Given the rapid emergence of evidence on e cigarette use in pregnancy a systematic review of the most recent evidence was conducted to inform stop smoking in pregnancy practice Whilst some recent reviews have considered the impact of e cigarette use in pregnancy these have often focussed on health related outcomes associated with foetal nicotine exposure in animal models with included human studies limited to investigating one or two birth related health outcomes or focussing more on post natal respiratory health Bednarczuk et al Mescolo et al Zhang et al This systematic review included only studies with human participants We investigated a range of factors which must be considered when using e cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool in pregnancy including prevalence perceptions health related outcomes and efficacy as a stop smoking tool Methods Design A systematic review was carried out and written in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines Page et al Ethical approval was acquired from blinded name University ref P Eligibility Criteria Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials RCTs qualitative studies or observational studies that investigated the use of e cigarettes in human pregnancy and or postpartum Participants were people who were had been or planned to be pregnant and their babies Studies also had to report outcomes relating to i prevalence of smoking cessation or uptake of e cigarettes during pregnancy ii health related outcomes iii barriers and facilitators to using e cigarettes whilst pregnant or iv benefits or harms associated with e cigarettes during pregnancy Studies had to present primary evidence e g not be an editorial or commentary article be peer reviewed and be available in the English language Literature review articles were also excluded however the reference lists of these articles were checked for any additional eligible articles to include Dissertations case studies and conference abstracts were also excluded Search strategy and selection process The Cumulative Index to Allied Health Literature CINAHL American Psychological Association APA PsycINFO and Medline were searched for relevant studies on the th February Searches were filtered to search for available articles published from which aligns with the final search date from Calder et al the most recent published systematic review on this topic The searches used for each database are included in the Supplementary Material Zotero referencing software was used to help manage articles identified from the search Rayyan Ouzzani et al a free web and mobile application was used to manage the screening and study selection process Titles and abstracts were screened by two researchers LB and EE and ineligible articles were excluded This process was repeated at the full text stage by the same two researchers Studies where eligibility remained unclear were screened by two new researchers MW and RP Reviewers worked independently in the screening process with conflicts resolved through discussion A third researcher LT confirmed eligibility of the studies at the point of extraction and writing up resulting in the removal of two studies previously included Reference lists and forward citations of the included studies were checked for any additional eligible articles to include During the time of the search studies were only available as pre prints but during the write up of the review they had been published and so the published article was cited in the report instead of the pre print Data extraction Data extraction for included studies was conducted by three reviewers LB EE and LT working independently and without any automation tools Microsoft Excel was used to facilitate this process Disagreements were resolved through revisiting the articles and where needed discussing articles with two further researchers MW and RP Original study authors were not approached regarding missing data Data extracted from studies included author s year of publication country of data collection year s of data collection topic of research study method e g qualitative cross sectional longitudinal observational sample characteristics including sample size age and characteristics about the pregnancy e g trimester singleton outcomes and study recommendations Extracted data was summarised in a table and outcomes were synthesised narratively Study quality assessment Two authors LT and MW independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute JBI critical appraisal tools designed for assessing cohort studies prevalence studies and qualitative studies Lockwood et al Moola et al Munn et al Any discrepancies in quality assessments were then discussed by both authors LT and MW and a final judgement agreed Quality appraisal judgements did not determine inclusion exclusion in the present review Results Study selection The search strategy identified results in total from the three databases plus reference and forward citation searches Figure articles remained after duplicates were removed After title and abstract screening articles were screened at the full text stage The two main reasons for exclusion at full text were articles not reporting primary evidence n and articles not reporting evidence related to e cigarettes in pregnancy or postpartum n Finally thirty seven articles were included in this review Figure Included study characteristics Characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table in the supplementary materials The majority of studies were conducted in

Coleman et al Kim Kurti et al Significant overlap of participants limits the power of combined outcomes across these large population based studies Internal validity was rated weaker because of imprecise measures of smoking or dual use such as retrospective recall and not accounting for smoking behaviours throughout pregnancy Most studies measured smoking and e cigarette use through retrospective self report however some studies incorporated hair nicotine content Cardenas et al or other biological indicators strengthening the validity of smoking behaviour reports Ashford et al

Dobbs Branscum et al Overall e cigarette prevalence was reported to have increased from in to in Head et al Obisesan et al Exploration of sociodemographic variables such as ethnicity education and socioeconomic status in relation to e cigarette prevalence showed women who used e cigarettes were more likely to be non Hispanic White Cardenas et al Head et al Kim Liu et al Regan et al Wang et al young adults Cardenas et al Head et al Opondo et al Regan et al Shittu et al Wang et al and were less likely to be Black women Hawkins et al Testa et al b Studies also reported that women who used e cigarettes frequently had lower education Cardenas et al Hawkins et al Head et al Opondo et al Regan et al Testa et al b Wang et al and income levels than women who did not use e cigarettes Head et al Testa et al b Whereas women who exclusively used e cigarettes had higher education and income levels than both women who used both combustible and e cigarettes Coleman et al Shittu et al and women who smoked combustible cigarettes only Coleman et al Rollins et al Shittu et al One secondary cross sectional analysis study found that lesbian women more often used e cigarettes than heterosexual women in a sample of women n of whom identified as lesbian n as bisexual and n as something else This study further reported that of sexual minorities used e cigarettes in the third trimester however the relatively small number of sexual minorities included in this study s analyses must be acknowledged and interpreted with caution Beck et al Moreover e cigarette prevalence was higher among incarceration exposed recent mothers compared with non incarceration exposed recent mothers Testa et al a A further secondary cross sectional analysis study reported that e cigarette use was more prevalent among women with pre or postnatal depression Head et al whilst another study found women who used e cigarettes were more likely to report symptoms of depression Rollins et al Four studies reported e cigarette use to be associated with increased alcohol consumption during Cardenas et al Liu et al Obisesan et al or in the three months prior to pregnancy Head et al Another study reported that e cigarette use in the third trimester was not associated with adolescent smoking in secondary analyses of longitudinal data Beck et al Health and birth related outcomes Thirteen studies reported health or birth related outcomes Ashford et al Cardenas et al Coleman et al Froggatt et al Froggatt Reissland Covey et al Hawkins et al Kim Oancea McDonnell et al Opondo et al Regan et al Regan Pereira Shittu et al Wang et al Reported outcomes were pre term birth small for gestational age low birth weight and other health related outcomes Pre term birth Eight studies examined associations between e cigarette use and pre term birth or gestational age Four studies reported no association Ashford et al Froggatt et al Hawkins et al Opondo et al whilst two secondary cross sectional analysis studies suggested that outcomes in this area did not differ between women who used e cigarettes and women who smoked combustible cigarettes with only abstinence from both smoking and e cigarette use associated with lower prevalence of preterm birth Kim Oancea Regan Pereira Elsewhere secondary cross sectional analysis indicated women who exclusively used e cigarettes had a higher prevalence of pre term birth when compared to women who did not use e cigarettes and did not differ from women who used both combustible and e cigarettes Regan et al Another secondary cross sectional analysis study reported that late pregnancy exclusive e cigarette use had a similar risk of pre term birth to non use Wang et al Small for gestational age SGA Seven studies examined associations between e cigarette use and SGA Most studies found that SGA was higher among children of women who used e cigarettes compared to women who did not use e cigarettes Cardenas et al Kim Oancea Regan et al Regan Pereira Shittu et al Wang et al Secondary cross sectional analyses reported this risk as equal to risk levels seen in women who exclusively smoked combustible cigarettes Kim Oancea Regan Pereira and women who used both combustible and e cigarettes Regan et al However one secondary cross sectional analysis study suggested that exclusive use of e cigarettes was associated with a lower risk of SGA than dual use Hawkins et al Another secondary cross sectional analysis study reported that women who used e cigarettes pre pregnancy who then quit during pregnancy had a lower risk of SGA than those who continued to use e cigarettes throughout their pregnancy Shittu et al Fully switching from cigarettes to e cigarettes during pregnancy was associated with a similar risk of SGA as in women who did not use e cigarettes with women who smoked combustible cigarettes who switched to dual use during pregnancy demonstrating a lower risk of SGA than women who continued smoking combustible cigarettes only Shittu et al One observational study reported no differences in head circumference between e cigarette exposed infants and non exposed infants Froggatt et al Low birth weight Eight studies examined associations between e cigarette use and low birth weight Two studies reported no difference in birth weight between the children of women who used e cigarettes and women who smoked combustible cigarettes whilst abstinence from both was associated with a lower prevalence of low birth weight Kim Oancea Regan Pereira Another secondary cross sectional analysis found low birth weight was higher among children of women who used e cigarettes than among women who did not use e cigarettes even when an adjustment for dual use was included Regan et al One longitudinal observational study described how children of mothers who switched from any product combustible cigarette and or e cigarette to no product weighed g more at birth than children of women who did not switch Ashford et al Women who used both combustible and e cigarettes were found to have children who weighed g less than women who did not use either whilst children of women who used e cigarettes exclusively weighed g less than those of women who did not use e cigarettes although this difference was not statistically significant in one secondary cross sectional analysis study Hawkins et al Two studies reported no associations between e cigarette use and birth weight in a cross sectional population survey and an observational study Froggatt et al Opondo et al whilst a further observational study found birthweight to be similar between women who did not smoke and women who exclusively smoked combustible cigarettes and between women who exclusively smoked combustible cigarettes and those who used both combustible and e cigarettes McDonnell et al Other health related outcomes A longitudinal observational study reported that e cigarette use was not associated with infant respiratory distress Ashford et al whilst secondary cross sectional analysis from a cohort study indicated that infants of women who exclusive used e cigarettes had lower levels of toxins except metals compared to children of women who used both combustible and e cigarettes where children of women who used both combustible and e cigarettes did not differ from those of women who smoked only combustible cigarettes Coleman et al One observational study looked at foetal mouth movements and described how the degree of movement declined from to weeks for both foetuses of women who did not use cigarettes and e cigarette exposed foetuses Froggatt et al One case control study reported a significantly greater number of abnormal reflexes in both combustible cigarette and e cigarette exposed infants compared to children of women who did not smoke Froggatt et al Attitudes and perceptions towards e cigarettes In total studies reported attitudes or perceptions towards e cigarettes in pregnancy In one study women perceived that e cigarettes were less risky to health than cigarettes irrespective of their own smoking status Dobbs Lu et al In some studies women had concerns about or lacked awareness of the safety and risks of e cigarettes whilst pregnant or breastfeeding Froggatt Reissland Covey Phillips et al Stacey et al although a longitudinal qualitative study reported that acceptability increased when e cigarettes were recommended by a health professional Phillips et al Two qualitative interview studies recruited people who used cigarettes some of whom reported perceptions that e cigarette use could be as risky Stacey et al or riskier Froggatt Reissland Covey than conventional cigarettes One cross sectional survey study reported that people who used e cigarettes were more likely than people who used combustible cigarettes to think e cigarettes were safer than conventional cigarettes Bowker Lewis Phillips et al Another cross sectional survey study found that of women who were pregnant and smoked believed e cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes Hamadneh et al One qualitative study reported that women enrolled in a multi centre randomised controlled trial investigating e cigarettes and NRT as smoking cessation tools in pregnancy reported positive attitudes towards e cigarette use holding beliefs that e cigarettes were necessary e g for harm reduction and this outweighed any concerns Ford et al Perceptions of the relative safety and economic benefits of e cigarettes alongside becoming confident with the use of e cigarettes and support from peers and health professionals were also linked with positive attitudes towards e cigarettes in a qualitative study Bowker et al Conversely one cross sectional survey study found that using e cigarettes during pregnancy was perceived to be less acceptable than using e cigarettes when not pregnant McCubbin et al whilst another study utilising visual elicitation interviews reported that pregnant women using e cigarettes felt negatively judged by healthcare professionals and strangers Grant et al A cross sectional survey study reported that among women who were pregnant and smoked intentions to switch to e cigarettes were associated with instrumental attitudes e g believing e cigarette use is good descriptive norms e g believing other pregnant people who smoke will switch during pregnancy and autonomy e g feeling in control of their decision to switch from cigarettes to e cigarettes Dobbs Branscum et al A common reason for using e cigarettes was to stop smoking Bowker et al Bowker Lewis Ussher et al Coleman et al McCubbin et al Eight in ten women who smoked cigarettes and or e cigarettes expressed this in one cross sectional study McCubbin et al whilst another secondary cross sectional analysis study reported that women switched to e cigarettes either to quit smoking or due to their appealing flavours Coleman et al Effects of e cigarette use on tobacco smoking cessation in pregnancy Eleven studies reported the effects of e cigarette use on smoking cessation behaviours during pregnancy Ashford et al Bowker Lewis Phillips et al Bowker Lewis Ussher et al Cardenas et al Kim Kurti et al McCubbin et al Regan Pereira Schilling et al Shittu et al Wang et al The proportion of women who quit all nicotine products during pregnancy ranged from to Cardenas et al Kim Regan Pereira Schilling et al Shittu et al Wang et al in women who exclusively smoked combustible cigarette to Cardenas et al Regan Pereira Schilling et al Shittu et al Wang et al in women who used both combustible and e cigarettes and to in women who only used e cigarettes Bowker Lewis Phillips et al Shittu et al The proportion of women who switched from dual use to e cigarettes only ranged from to Ashford et al Bowker Lewis Ussher et al Cardenas et al Shittu et al Wang et al whilst to of women dual using switched in the opposite direction to combustible cigarettes only Ashford et al Shittu et al Wang et al One longitudinal observational study reported that of women who only smoked combustible cigarette switched to dual use during their second trimester however one third of these participants then switched back to exclusively smoking combustible cigarettes during the third trimester Ashford et al In a longitudinal cohort study of participants exclusively used e cigarettes at enrolment of whom still exclusively used e cigarettes in later pregnancy and of whom continued this behaviour postpartum with those who didn t continue exclusive e cigarette use switching to dual use Bowker Lewis Ussher et al This study also reported that of women who used both combustible and e cigarettes at enrolment continued this behaviour in late pregnancy By postpartum however one third of these participants had switched to combustible cigarettes only with only continuing with dual use In this study of participants switched from dual use to e cigarettes only during late pregnancy and continued this behaviour postpartum whilst of women who only smoked combustible cigarettes switched to dual use during late pregnancy and switched to e cigarettes only of women who smoked combustible cigarettes and switched to dual use during pregnancy however returned to exclusively smoking combustible cigarettes postpartum Bowker Lewis Ussher et al A prospective observational study in the Republic of Ireland reported that of pregnant women in their sample who exclusively used e cigarettes and of women who formerly used e cigarettes formerly smoked combustible cigarettes Kurti et al When we consider smoking reduction as well as cessation one secondary cross sectional analysis study reported a similar proportion of women who only smoked combustible cigarettes and women who used both combustible and e cigarettes stopped or reduced their cigarette use during pregnancy and respectively Cardenas et al whilst a cross sectional survey study found that more women who smoked combustible cigarettes only reported smoking daily than women who used both combustible and e cigarettes and respectively McCubbin et al This study also reported a higher proportion of women who used both combustible and e cigarettes smoking more than one pack a day compared to women who only smoked combustible cigarettes although this difference was not statistically significant McCubbin et al Discussion Summary of findings This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence published since about the use of e cigarettes in pregnancy Thirty seven eligible studies presented evidence on prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy attitudes and perceptions around e cigarette use during pregnancy associations of e cigarette use with birth and health outcomes and efficacy of e cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool in pregnancy Our review indicated an overall prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy of between and although included studies suggested that this rate may be lower during the last three months of pregnancy When we excluded dual use of e cigarettes and combustible cigarettes such that only exclusive e cigarette use was considered population prevalence reduced to to suggesting that e cigarettes are more commonly used to supplement combustible cigarette use during pregnancy than to replace all combustible cigarette use Our findings suggest women who used e cigarettes during pregnancy were more likely to be non Hispanic White young adults with lower education and lower income levels than women who did not use e cigarettes Similarly both women who smoked combustible cigarettes and women who used both combustible and e cigarettes were found to generally have lower education and lower income levels than women who exclusively used e cigarettes Studies included in this review reported frequent expressions of concern and or lack of awareness about the safety of using e cigarettes when pregnant or breastfeeding whilst demonstrating the significant impact of health professionals advice on people s attitudes towards this issue With regards to health outcomes our findings suggest that e cigarettes do not pose greater risks to parent or infant health than combustible cigarettes however it remains unclear to what extent e cigarettes are advantageous over combustible cigarettes in terms of harm reduction Importantly the majority of studies reporting health related outcomes relied upon secondary analyses of retrospective data The gold standard for research in this area is prospective longitudinal design therefore more studies using this study design are required to improve the quality of research evidence in this area Finally the efficacy of e cigarettes as a tool for stopping smoking during pregnancy remains unclear with quit rates for women who use both e cigarettes and combustible cigarettes appearing similar Return to combustible cigarette use during late pregnancy or post partum was also reported in a number of studies in particular in individuals who switched to dual use during pregnancy rather than to e cigarettes exclusively Consistency with other findings The prevalence of e cigarette use in our review is consistent with the findings from a previous review which reported a prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy of around to in the USA with a prevalence of below in women who had not previously smoked Calder et al A similar prevalence of of pregnant women using e cigarettes has also previously been reported in the United Kingdom Bowker et al Some findings regarding patterns of use were consistent with wider evidence in non pregnant populations with e cigarette use found to be most prevalent in socioeconomically disadvantaged White young adults however a previous review of sociodemographic patterns in e cigarette use found that they are more popular among those with higher educational attainment Green et al Hartwell et al Previous research has indicated that pregnant women generally perceive e cigarettes as safer than combustible cigarettes especially if they are being used as smoking cessation tools Bowker et al Kahr et al Vickerman et al Wagner et al This was supported by our review with a general reported perception that e cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes and are therefore a better option during pregnancy This review also highlighted the significant influence that healthcare professionals can have on perceptions in this area Previous qualitative research investigating healthcare professionals beliefs and attitudes towards e cigarettes during pregnancy and postpartum however has identified limited knowledge and a lack of training in this area Hunter et al Therefore the importance of adequate training to allow professionals to suitably advise pregnant women as well as the general public about the risks and or benefits of e cigarette use is key and should be provided if e cigarettes are to be offered as a harm reduction approach nationally and internationally Switching to e cigarettes can significantly reduce pregnant women s exposure to carcinogens however nicotine exposure is still an area of concern Hickson et al Previous studies with animals and humans have suggested that nicotine exposure alone during pregnancy may have adverse effects in terms of lung development function and brain development as well as impacting behavioural outcomes and reducing birthweight Batstra et al Dwyer et al Holbrook Navarro et al Nguyen et al although similar birthweights for babies born to women who use e cigarettes and women who do not smoke have also been reported Dhalwani et al as well as reduced risk of miscarriage ectopic tubal pregnancy and stillbirth Cohn et al Our review revealed mixed findings relating to associations between e cigarette use and birth related outcomes There were reports of the same apparent risk of pre term birth in women who exclusively use e cigarettes women who use both combustible and e cigarettes and women who only smoke combustible cigarettes as well as increased risk of SGA and low birthweight reported in women who use e cigarettes compared to those who don t although rates for both were lower in women who used e cigarettes than for those who smoked combustible cigarettes This has been supported by a recent investigation reporting a increase in the risk of preterm birth and low birthweights among women who use e cigarettes during pregnancy compared to those who don t Galbo et al It is notable however that this study also utilised the PRAMS dataset therefore investigating the same participants as a large number of the studies included in this review There were also instances of studies reporting no association between e cigarette use and each of these outcomes as well as no association with infant respiratory distress or foetal mouth movements Additionally e cigarette use was reported to result in reduced toxin exposure however abnormal reflexes were reported in infants of both women who use e cigarettes and women who smoke combustible cigarettes as compared to women who do not smoke Hajek et al investigated the efficacy and safety of e cigarettes in comparison to nicotine patches among pregnant women The RCT concluded that the safety profile of e cigarettes is similar to that of nicotine patches however low birthweight g was less frequent in the e cigarette arm of this study versus RR CI p in comparison to nicotine patches This data suggests e cigarettes might be an optional treatment for pregnant women who are trying to quit smoking Hajek et al and supports the use of e cigarettes in stop smoking services for pregnant women Previous research has suggested that e cigarettes are now the most commonly used smoking cessation aid in England McNeill et al with e cigarette use self reported as a key reason for quitting smoking in previous studies England et al Mark et al as well as across the studies in the present review E cigarettes have also been reported to be notably more effective than traditional NRT methods Hajek et al Hartmann Boyce et al Tong et al however a previous review of e cigarette use during pregnancy suggested no difference in smoking cessation rates between pregnant women using e cigarettes and those not using them Calder et al Additionally one study included in this review reported that whilst e cigarettes are an effective means of reducing tobacco consumption through moving from combustible to non combustible products moving to e cigarettes appears to decrease the likelihood of quitting nicotine products entirely Higher quit rates have previously been identified in women who exclusively use e cigarettes than in women who use both combustible and e cigarettes or women who smoke only combustible cigarettes Calder et al Notably most women who switched from dual use to exclusive e cigarette use during pregnancy reported returning to dual use postpartum whilst some women who used both combustible and e cigarettes also reported switching exclusively to combustible cigarettes either during late pregnancy or postpartum Calder et al This builds upon previous reports that the majority of transitions from dual use to single use in reproductive aged women involve dropping the non cigarette product in favour of combustible cigarettes Kurti et al These results suggest that e cigarettes may serve as a useful alternative to combustible cigarettes during pregnancy but that their efficacy as a smoking cessation tool may decrease once the pregnancy has ended Strengths and limitations All sections of the review were carried out and reported following international guidance set out by PRISMA Evidence quality was assured by using multiple reviewers throughout key stages of the process and high reliability between reviewers at all stages The review included a large number of studies all of which were judged to be of moderate or good quality Included studies were also conducted across multiple countries although the majority of research was carried out in the United Kingdom or United States Limitations of this review include that we did not search grey literature or consider studies that were not available in English Many studies also relied upon retrospective self report measures recruiting postpartum women who were asked to recall smoking behaviours during pregnancy potentially limiting the accuracy of data collected although four studies also incorporated biological indicators that could verify self report findings In addition many of the prevalence studies included in this review used the same population of participants from the United States used PRAMS used PATH whilst national differences were indicated in smaller studies with different populations Implications and conclusions Whilst there is increasing research examining the prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy the effectiveness of e cigarettes as a stop smoking tool remains unclear The evidence presented throughout this review suggests that stop smoking in pregnancy interventions should support pregnant people to stop smoking both combustible cigarettes and e cigarettes though exclusive e cigarette use may reduce harm compared to combustible cigarette use or dual use E cigarette use during pregnancy was reported to be more prevalent in women with symptoms of depression in homosexual women and in incarceration exposed women as well as being associated with increased alcohol consumption months before or during pregnancy Interventions using e cigarettes as smoking cessation tool in pregnancy therefore should incorporate support for depression and alcohol consumption as well as offering additional support for sexual minorities It is also important for services to offer postpartum support if they wish to prevent a return to combustible cigarette smoking Interventions must also ensure that health professionals are appropriately equipped with knowledge about the relative safety of e cigarettes to effectively advise and support service users More prospective longitudinal studies investigating the health and birth outcomes associated with e cigarette use during pregnancy are required to improve the quality of research evidence in this area and to allow clearer conclusions about the safety of e cigarettes in pregnancy to be drawn Future studies must also aim to accurately measure and account for the role of dual use i e use of both combustible cigarettes and e cigarettes as well as exclusive e cigarette use when examining associations with health related outcomes More qualitative research is also needed to examine the views and experiences of people who begin e cigarette use during pregnancy to better identify barriers and facilitators affecting the use of e cigarettes as a smoking cessation and harm reduction tool Supplementary Material Search strategies used and the characteristics of included studies are included

Study quality was low for all four studies Conclusions The findings of this review suggest that eHealth interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes for young kidney transplant patients More robust and high quality studies are now needed to validate these findings Future studies should also extend beyond short term outcomes and consider cost of implementation The review was

current review will Feasibility Participants found the prototype mHealth system need to be updated with initiatives evolved during and after COVID easy to use at home and supportive for their

providing care to pill bottle usage into their daily medication taking routine with a ma vulnerable patients while struggling with staff shortages This re jority of them experiencing pill bottle

review demonstrated improvement in dietary checklists and tools which could be seen as a strength of this study outcomes e g sodium fluid intake across an adult population but However there are some significant limitations and this study should evidence was rated as low due to high or unknown risk of bias across therefore be interpreted in context of these shortcomings studies Heterogeneity in intervention type and components made it Firstly results of this review present a small amount of studies all impossible to conclude what elements of eHealth interventions are published before October reflecting the start of COVID effective in this population pandemic Studies demonstrate limited evidence base characterized by As long as there is no unified definition and golden standard of low quality due to a small sample size in relation to the amount of measuring adherence it makes it challenging for researchers and clini outcome measures derived from one treatment centre its preliminary cians to summarize treatment effects across studies and draw definite character no predefined SAP different methods of measuring adherence conclusions what works for this population It has been suggested and nonblinding of participants and study staff increasing the chance of that Tacrolimus is not adequately captured by measuring it in blood a positive bias towards effectiveness of the introduced technologies concentrations due to variation with other clinical outcomes such as Based on current searches across international trial registries and sci rejection However based on the current studies Tacrolimus seems entific databases it is clear that new usability feasibility and effective to be the most objective assessment of adherence as pill bottle openings ness trials studies are on its way which will give us a better does not necessarily mean that patients actually take those pills whereas understanding what is out there and more importantly what works for self reported adherence seems to reflect an overestimation For whom More robust and high quality randomized controlled trials future studies it is recommended to use a combination of objective and should be performed enabling researchers to build up the evidence base subjective measures to assess non adherence with self report ques on the effects of eHealth interventions on self management adherence tionnaire lab report and clinician s observations having the highest and clinical outcomes in young kidney transplant patients sensitivity and specificity Secondly included studies mainly reflect older participants as the As indicated in previous studies the nature of adherence is condition is more prevalent among older patients Future studies should complex but this was not reflected in any of the studies except for one address this by focussing on adolescent and young adult population study in which case management and personalisation is offered given the implications of non adherence in terms of graft survival and through telemedicine Expecting improvement of adherence and clinical acute rejections Also two studies were only focussing on specific outcomes from an electronic pill dispenser in nonadherent patients is immunosuppressive drugs Although this might not represent a unrealistic as they are highly likely to be non adherent to elaborate fully representative sample other factors were representatively pre procedures Innovative and well designed advanced systems that sented across the studies such as gender and inclusion of living and include artificial intelligence might be able to tackle this by embedding deceased donors as well as the use of convenient sampling pre it in a non invasive unobtrusive way into their daily life Monitoring venting inclusion of patients who are adherent already which happens automatically instead of relying on patient input for example through mostly during the first three months after hospitalization For future wearables could be part of the solution clinicians and researchers face studies it is important to include a representative sample consisting of regarding non adherent patients Additionally given the fact that adherent and non adherent patients Recruiting and engaging non adolescence and young adulthood brings on its own challenges e g adherent patients can be challenging but can be supported through independence autonomy this will need to be taken into account into site selection considering patient characteristics minimizing the burden future studies of study procedures for patients following sequential selection of Although innovative eHealth interventions such as wearable devices eligible patients while monitoring characteristics of other eligible pa are being developed data privacy and security issues remain with the tients who were not recruited and compare primary outcome of risk of successful cyberattacks capturing highly sensitive data adherence and other patient characteristics using an existing national Moreover future studies need to take implementation strategies and database Kostalova et al cost effectiveness of adherence interventions into account from a patient Thirdly studies elaborate an earlier review performed in the field of as well as healthcare professional perspective Implementation science transplantation and resemble a recent review but contribute to remains underutilized with implementation aspects underreported the field through its specific focus on technology based interventions in across randomized controlled studies in transplantation For future kidney transplant patients Moreover a more elaborate narrative review studies it is important to include information at study start on context and critical quality appraisal are presented stakeholders sample representativeness feasibility and implementation Finally while the majority of the studies was focussed on treatment strategies to ultimately support implementation in clinical care contexts adherence and clinical outcomes none of the studies assessed self To ensure the development and successful long term use of management It is expected that self managing a condition takes more eHealth interventions end users and healthcare professionals should be time and guidance than was provided by the interventions of the involved from the beginning to prevent a mismatch in needs and solu included studies with a year follow up period This is also tions There should be reliable internet access devices should be pro confirmed by one study implying that there is more focus on acute vided and training offered where needed Patients appreciate flexibility care and case management during the first year instead of focussing on regarding data access fine tuning of intervention content reflecting long term goals such as sustaining adherence and self managing a their unique experiences of transplant care and involvement of their certain chronic condition social support system Increased workload and costs should be avoided by integrating eHealth intervention into the existing workflow Conclusions However this seems challenging with most healthcare systems being outdated and conservative in terms of their infrastructure Financial This review stresses the need for more robust and high quality reimbursement of eHealth interventions seems challenging across most studies with representative samples in the field of renal transplant conservative and resource lacking healthcare systems with a strong lack before any firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of

University of Leicester Leicester UK Corresponding author lorna odoherty coventry ac uk Background One million people in England and Wales experience sexual violence and abuse each year with nearly half experiencing serious sexual offences around survivors access sexual assault referral centres Objectives This research was commissioned by National Institute for Health and Care Research to evaluate access interventions and care pathways for survivors especially those provided through sexual assault referral centres Design setting participants The sexual assault referral centres care pathway was investigated through six sub studies There were two Cochrane Reviews participants Seventy two providers and survivors were interviewed at eight sites the children and young people study involved participants from two sexual assault referral centres A cohort study involving three wave data collection over year sites service users screened recruited used a multilevel modelling framework to explore risk factors for burden of post traumatic stress disorder symptoms at baseline and change at year We analysed costs and outcomes and conducted a narrative analysis survivors We worked closely with survivors and prioritised the safety welfare of participants and researchers Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning

for post traumatic stress disorder and depression Sexual assault referral centres delivered a high quality frontline service for survivors but groups experiencing domestic abuse and some ethnic and cultural minorities were under represented The qualitative research emphasised inter agency collaboration for survivor benefit The cohort study identified a risk triad of adverse childhood experiences poor mental health and economic deprivation which was associated with baseline trauma burden There were important improvements in trauma symptoms a year later These improvements were unrelated to different sexual assault referral centre models Costs and other outcomes were also similar across models Harmful policing and justice practices procedures were identified by of participants In this context trauma competent interviewing techniques regular timely updates and conveying case decisions with care signalled good practice Limitations The cohort study lacked a comparison group reducing confidence in the finding that access to sexual assault referral centres explained the reduction observed in post traumatic stress disorder Conclusions and future work Barriers to access call for concerted efforts to implement trauma informed universal health services The risk triad underscores the value of holistic approaches to care at sexual assault referral centres and timely follow on care Poor mental health was the main barrier to service access beyond sexual assault referral centres The persistence of trauma symptoms a year after accessing sexual assault referral centres signals urgent need for tackling counselling wait lists expanding support options and commitment to lifelong care Multidisciplinary evaluation of sexual assault referral centres for better health provides a

assault referral centres provide support health care and if people wish can gather evidence for a criminal investigation Sexual assault referral centres also open routes to other care support We intended to understand the benefits of sexual assault referral centres and ways to improve care What did we do We interviewed professionals to understand how they worked together We followed up survivors over year after visiting a sexual assault referral centre We gathered the views of children and young people and people from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds We examined existing research to gather evidence of the benefit of care support We worked with survivors to confirm the safety and relevance of our research What did we find Participants were positive about sexual assault referral centres and Independent Sexual Violence Advisors reporting very low harms viewed sexual assault referral centre services as harmful to them They were also satisfied with charities offering counselling helplines and advocacy harms The research gathered mixed feedback about the National Health Service and police with more harm being reported and respectively We found gaps in NHS care for those with complex trauma and long term mental health problems Post traumatic stress disorder affected of participants with the highest being observed for those with adverse childhood experiences poor mental health and economic struggles a risk triad Improvements occurred year later although half of participants still had trauma symptoms We identified new treatments e g yoga as potential alternatives to traditional interventions What does this mean Sexual assault referral centres offer excellent care to survivors but should be accessible to a wider group of people Identifying supporting and careful referral of those with the risk triad mentioned may aid recovery after sexual violence and abuse The research suggests that the NHS and policing justice needs to ensure that they provide good care more often Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health xxiii and

abuse access sexual assault referral centres SARCs each year therefore there has been an urgent need to assess the experiences of these services There is also a need to improve options for care the visibility of and access to SARCs and collaboration within frontline specialist services to serve people of all ages and genders exposed to sexual assault and rape in England This research was commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Research NIHR to evaluate the provision of SARCs We intended to determine the extent to which SARCs meet the needs of victims and survivors of recent and non recent sexual violence and abuse including children young people and other survivors who may be silenced across different communities in Britain Objectives The multidisciplinary evaluation of sexual assault referral centres for better health MESARCH project addressed a range of research questions allowing for the evaluation of SARCs and expanding evidence for different services and interventions across SARC care pathways The questions are as follows For individuals who have had exposure to sexual violence and abuse do psychosocial interventions reduce post traumatic stress disorder PTSD and other poor health outcomes What are providers experiences of delivering such psychosocial interventions What are the experiences of survivors and supporters in accessing such psychosocial interventions What are the implications of inter related aspects of SARCs the everyday work they do the workforce the technology and the organisation for the delivery of SARC services To what extent are SARCs embedded within the overall response by statutory and voluntary sector organisations to meet the needs of survivors What are the health and cost trajectories of those who attend SARCs How can these be compared for different SARC models of service delivery and access to health and Sexual Assault and Abuse Services SAAS What is the effect of different sectors where survivors receive care including any advantages or disadvantages of accessing post crisis counselling in the voluntary sector compared with the NHS What are the experiences of children and young people CYP in receiving care and support from SARCs What do CYP s recovery journeys look like after receiving support from SARCs What are the experiences of access to SARCs by survivors with additional vulnerabilities such as chronic mental health problems and survivors from racially and other minoritised populations such as lesbian gay bisexual transgender and or queer survivors and those with socio economic deprivation Methods An innovative focus on patient and public involvement prioritised the safety and welfare of participants and researchers largely through experts by experience embedded across the project lifecycle A range of mixed methods was employed Systematic review meta analysis and qualitative evidence synthesis for two Cochrane Reviews For the SARC process evaluation we mapped out service delivery undertook thematic analysis of data collected from professionals from a range of SARCs and partners and integrated qualitative data on survivors experiences from the

studies in the Cochrane Reviews were health emergency primary care and clinical therapeutic mental health medico legal similar to SARCs universities and community charity provided services and most studies were from the USA For our primary research our process evaluation study included eight SARC sites and their inward and onwards partners professionals the cohort study followed up survivors attending SARCs the CYP study was conducted at two SARCs the qualitative study included cohort participants and a community non SARC setting Overall voluntary sector agencies a local authority and an NHS sexual health clinic referred people into the sub studies as our main model of recruitment The study participants included professionals and survivors from service providers in the process

Review revealed that interventions helped survivors to better understand trauma and its effects re engage in many areas of life and improve interpersonal functioning Readiness was vital for engagement and may be as important as intervention content Empowering survivors and supporters to make decisions about their interventions for instance having control over when they start and end interventions was an important step in recovery Our process evaluation study showed that SARCs remain an underutilised care pathway for survivors exacerbated by lack of awareness in the general public and thus survivors Routes to SARC care are well established among police forces but poorly developed across some other professional groups e g general practitioners GPs Statutory and voluntary sector organisations working in partnership provides enhanced care for survivors but SARCs and other organisations are hampered by a range of organisational and commissioning structures and processes Service

trauma indicated four or more adverse childhood experiences ACEs and had prior exposure to domestic abuse Seventeen per cent of the users faced major daily financial problems Nearly half of them had pre existing mental health problems at the point of accessing SARC and more than half had attempted suicide Between SARC access and baseline had been prescribed psychotropic medications and had an average of contacts with health social third sector care contacts at months a longer timeframe dropping to at months At baseline of participants had probable PTSD decreasing to at year This reflected an unadjusted mean reduction of points on PCL CI to Cohen s d equating to a clinically important within group change One third of the original cohort was lost to follow up at year differing from those

the location of the ISVA some ISVAs are part of the SARC team and others are located in the community There was strong evidence of a positive association between service use and symptom level at

associated with a point greater score of PTSD symptoms CI to p and pre existing mental health problems with a point difference CI to p Participants with greater financial resources had fewer symptoms than for those with smaller financial resources p Additionally there was strong evidence that being unable to work was associated with a point higher baseline score p For offence related factors there was weak evidence that a delay to SARC of more than days was associated with an approximately point greater symptom score p and a similar level of evidence was observed for an association for perpetrator type where it appears that when the perpetrator was the survivor s partner family member the baseline symptom score was greater The main predictor of PTSD at months was the baseline score A high ACE profile doubled the odds of meeting the PTSD diagnostic threshold at baseline but it reduced to at months and was absent at year SARCs and third sector agencies achieved consistently high standards of care for survivors across sub studies with of participants submitting ratings for these sectors as on a harm benefit scale to However harmful responses were much more common in statutory health and justice settings affecting and of participants respectively compared with for SARCs and for the third sector The children and young people study observed that recovery and healing was influenced by how quickly the CYP accessed support its content and duration the location and context of care how well the services worked together and CYP s interactions with professionals at SARCs and across sectors The embedded narrative study identified vital issues around access as well as risk and recovery in particular inequalities arising from chronic mental health economic disadvantage and family community based abuse highly mirroring the risk triad identified in the cohort study Consistent support for survivors from all professionals and organisations a survivor engages with ability to move away from the location where abuse has occurred and the opportunity to keep trying different therapies or activities supporting recovery were identified as helpful approaches to the recovery journey Conclusions Sexual assault referral centres must recognise the high burden of lifetime trauma and chronic mental problems that affect most service users accessing this service There is evidence that these factors together with socio economic status affect people s PTSD presentation to a greater degree than aspects of the offence perpetrator and time since trauma although these were still important Different types of SARC and ISVA models did not appear to impinge on trauma symptoms at year or the way Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under

within the SARC and onwards support agencies Survivor service use was positively related to baseline trauma which decreased over time and costs did not differ according to the type of SARC or ISVA service accessed This emphasises the importance of raising the visibility of SARCs as a care route overall rather than recommending a specific model of delivery The SARC pathway may deliver benefits to survivors who report clinically important reductions over time especially among those with the greatest burden However half of the study sample participants remained positive for PTSD at year Every recovery journey following a sexual assault or abuse is different and both formal and informal sources of support are important A consistent trauma informed societal response to sexual violence is needed For CYP early support from SARCs and accessible trauma informed support throughout adolescence and into adulthood was critical in young people s recovery Implications for health care Sexual assault referral centre services deliver a high quality frontline service for survivors and an effective gateway to health ISVAs and voluntary sector services A triad of lifetime traumas chronic mental health problems and economic deprivation is apparent which highlights the potential for holistic approaches at SARCs Enquiring about a wide range of background factors may enhance timely access to appropriate therapies see our Cochrane Reviews as well as to social care and advocacy for housing finances and domestic abuse as part of the mul tipronged approach to support recovery and healing among survivors of sexual violence and abuse Mental health difficulties represented the main barrier to accessing services beyond SARCs and people affected struggled to consistently access the primary and therapeutic care they needed in the NHS as well as engagement with justice calling for dedicated ISVA resources with mental health specialism Inequalities are exacerbated in situations where survivors with relevant resources have the ability to pay for the therapeutic care they need and those without resources do not have the ability to pay and are left waiting The findings on risk facing racially and other minoritised groups call for concerted efforts to support people to reach care through outreach programmes and campaigns and implement trauma informed universal health services Narratives of racial and cultural discrimination by services were not dominant in our qualitative enquiry but a profound damage was reported when discrimination had occurred There are vital interconnections between experiences of justice and health outcomes in this con text Harm in police and justice settings was marked and calls for ongoing efforts to improve communication and other practices by the police in this context are warranted Our data identified the good practice witnessed and narratives containing practical measures agencies can take to minimise harms and enhance experiences of justice We found support for cohesive commissioning strategies that promote a collaborative whole systems approach to meeting the wide ranging needs of people after exposure to sexual violence and abuse The research evidences important improvements in trauma symptoms but symptoms persisted for many participants at year supporting calls for tackling wait lists enhancing the therapy offering and a commitment to lifelong care for survivors of sexual violence and abuse Working with survivor stakeholders at all research levels has been demonstrated to enhance fea sibility of

Vol No Chapter Introduction Background and context Evidence suggests that one in five women and one in men in England and Wales have experienced sexual violence and abuse since the age of years Sexual violence is defined as any sexual act or attempt at a sexual act or an act directed at a person s sexuality involving coercion by any person regardless of their relationship with the subjected individual It includes but is not restricted to rape sexual assault child sexual abuse CSA sexual harassment rape within marriage and relationships forced marriage so called honour based violence female genital mutilation trafficking sexual exploitation and ritual abuse Before the COVID pandemic fewer than one in six victims of rape reported to the police In the year ending September the number of sexual offences recorded by the police was the highest level recorded within a month period and showed a increase when compared with the number of offences recorded by the police for the year ending March Sexual violence and abuse is a serious public health concern for which the range of immediate and long term physical and mental health effects are well documented Physical health consequences for women include unwanted pregnancy sexually transmitted infections STIs painful sex chronic pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding For men these include genital and rectal injuries and erectile dysfunction The mental health effects of sexual violence are substantial The incidence and severity of post traumatic stress disorder PTSD is common among women and men who have experienced sexual violence and abuse Other mental health consequences include anxiety depression self harm and suicidality alcohol and drug abuse as well as eating disorders Furthermore experiencing mental health problems is associated with an increased risk of other long term health conditions including hypertension cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal problems The significant health burden of sexual violence and abuse has wider economic costs to society reaching more than billion per year Although a wealth of evidence underpins the substantial negative effects of sexual violence and abuse much less is understood about the longer term health and well being outcomes for survivors In light of this there has been a call for dedicated longitudinal research on the health effects of sexual violence Notably a recent year follow up study in South Africa reported that women survivors were more likely to acquire human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection in that time compared with control group women who had not been raped However the longitudinal exploration of survivor s health and well being remains limited More broadly there are key gaps in sexual violence research with men survivors and survivors who have a disability Additionally there is a lack of research that has examined sexual violence and abuse exposure and chronic mental health problems and comorbidity of health outcomes and understanding sexual health and well being outcomes beyond measuring STI acquisition only Why is research on sexual assault referral centres needed Providing accessible and an evidence based response to survivors is critical The World Health Organization WHO recommended that an initial response should include providing survivors with medico legal and health services at the same time through holistic care in the same location and preferably by the same health practitioner In the USA many states now offer Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programmes or Sexual Assault Response Teams to provide the recommended services This type of support has been modelled in Australia Canada and the UK In England and other parts of the UK investment in sexual assault referral centres SARCs has grown considerably especially as a best practice response for survivors after incidents of sexual assault or rape Sexual assault referral Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty

the care and support needs for survivors of any age and gender regardless of whether the survivor is a recent or non recent victim and to support survivors with the opportunity to make a police report if they choose to do so As highlighted in the National Service Specification for SARCs which outlines the aims and service standards of SARCs the core services provided at SARCs include crisis emotional support by dedicated crisis workers a forensic medical examination FME or nurse led examination to enable the collection of evidence needed to prosecute alleged perpetrators provision of emergency contraception and HIV post exposure prophylaxis referral to sexual health centres and other healthcare services referral for mental healthcare needs such as counselling and to an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor ISVA particularly if navigating the criminal justice system CJS Thus SARCs operate within a wider landscape of Sexual Assault and Abuse Services SAAS across several systems and government organisations including health social care and criminal justice partners As stated in the Specification an effective SARC does not simply provide services to survivors but rather helps them understand what options are available and facilitate their choices with care There are approximately SARCs in England including a number of specialist paediatric sites While NHS England NHSE is responsible for the commissioning of the public health element within SARCs the police and or police and crime commissioners are responsible for commissioning forensic medical examination services SARCs operate with considerable variation in areas where they are located such as in hospitals or community settings and the organisational model in which their services are delivered for example individual SARCs can be led by the police private organisations the NHS or charities To date little is known about how effective and cost effective SARCs are in addressing the physical and mental health outcomes for child and adult survivors There is also a lack of evidence about whether the varying models in which SARCs operate has an effect on their effectiveness to support survivors There are sparse data focusing on survivors access to mental health care after reaching a SARC and how service users of ethnic minority backgrounds as well as sexual and gender minority communities might experience care and support from SARCs Research objectives Aims To evaluate the evidence for psychosocial interventions for survivors of sexual violence and abuse To examine SARC models of service delivery by exploring work practices workforce and technology factors and the integration of SARCs in the broader context of a health and community response to sexual violence and abuse To undertake a year follow up study in a cohort of survivors of sexual violence and abuse to explore the effect of different SARC models of service delivery access to health care and other SAAS on PTSD depressive symptoms quality of life QoL substance misuse violence re exposure sexual health and costs To identify the effect of delivering post crisis trauma focused counselling interventions in the voluntary sector compared with the NHS on health and other outcomes To engage young SARC service users age range years and explore impacts of exposure to sexual violence and abuse on their lives and quality of care and support from SARCs To draw on the cohort sample using maximum variation sampling to ensure a broad range of subgroups represented supplemented by a community sample and to conduct a

Roger Ingham had oversight of the multidisciplinary evaluation of sexual assault referral centres for better health MESARCH project The Committee held sessions at monthly junctures over the project lifecycle used to gather progress updates from the project team including review of the monthly progress reports submitted to the National Institute for Health and Care Research NIHR and the funder s response These sessions assessed adherence to the study protocol and discussed amendments assessed barriers to progress enabled access to guidance and the range of expertise available through the members who linked us with resources and networks and enabled space for problem solving reflection and celebrating the big and small achievements of the project The membership is listed in our protocol and included two members of our Lived Experiences Group patient and public involvement PPI see Patient and public involvement and at least one representative was in attendance at all Committee sessions The NIHR was notified of meeting minutes and actions arising from meetings with the SSC and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee DMEC see Ethics The SSC was also available to provide independent advice as required outside of the scheduled SSC meetings Ethics Oversight and approvals Approvals were granted by research ethics committees and the Health Research Authority before any data collection Approval dates and reference numbers are provided in the Ethics Statement at the end of the report In addition five NHS SARC sites and one onward referral NHS agency confirmed site capacity and capability Amendments to the study protocol and documentation were discussed with the SSC and approval was sought and obtained from the relevant ethics committees These amendments are outlined in V of the protocol The DMEC met on three occasions over the project course with the purpose of monitoring data collection and analyses across all studies risks to the project and making recommendations on the ethical considerations where appropriate Ethical considerations We now outline key ethical considerations that were made across the studies that involved primary data collection SARC process evaluation cohort study embedded qualitative study and the CYP s study In the presentation of findings and quotes we have ensured that participants are not identifiable Where we had permission to use direct quotes from participants we have used pseudonyms chosen by participants or the research team or quotes have been attributed to an unidentifiable label In addition to the project team receiving regular training for conducting interviews with survivors of sexual violence and abuse we developed a safety protocol drawing on safety and distress protocols from our previous published work and based on the expertise of the MESARCH team members of our Lived Experiences Group LEG and SSC staff at Coventry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre and informed by the Charter of Survivors Voices The safety protocol outlined different procedures the project team would follow in relation to key risks The procedures are as follows Promoting the safety of participants Project team interviewers were trained to ensure that if a person expressed a concern about their current safety or well being then they were ready to ask about safety and support the interviewee or participant to seek the help they need Equally the interviewer was trained to enquire and respond if there was a concern based on other cues such as behaviours of the respondent or indirect expressions of fear or worry or risk of self harm or suicidality as well as environment cues such as background noise Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the

the contract set out at the beginning of the research about exceptions to maintaining confidentiality The safety protocol also outlined an approach to discuss safety planning with a participant when they disclosed information and processes for recording disclosures of risk As part of monitoring the safety and well being of participants we used a RAG red amber green system of different categories see Appendix Table The red category incidents involved considering whether we had to break confidentiality to promote safety through mandatory reporting The decision to break confidentiality did not occur in the project Responding to a participant s distress We were mindful that there could be situations where a participant could be distressed at any stage of the research This occurred during of interviews The researchers informed participants that the research could be concluded at any time and were prepared to signpost them to local or national services or connect them with their crisis worker ISVA or Children and Young People s Independent Sexual Violence Advisor ChISVA for further support Although we did not ask participants to share details about the nature of the sexual abuse they experienced the questions included in the interviews were carefully developed to avoid blaming or stigmatising language Interviewers were mindful of triggers that could cause distress or embarrassment Interviewers also reminded participants that they could choose which questions they felt comfortable to answer Researchers were also trained in responding to participants experiencing a flashback during participation in the research and in monitoring whether negative effects were arising directly from the study over time New disclosures and data being subpoenaed by the criminal justice system The project was committed to not jeopardising any criminal proceedings We explained to participants before the research interviews and throughout the research process that if their case was going through the CJS then there was a possibility that the project could be asked to provide information submitted by a participant to the research if requested by the courts If participants had a live case and chose to talk about the incident s researchers were trained to remind participants of the commitments of the research and offered to direct the discussion to another part of the interview New first disclosures or disclosures of new information about a live case would require the team to pass on the information to the police however we had no instance of having to take this action Maintaining safety for researchers It was important that researchers made their role clear to participants that the purpose of the study was intended for research and not for treatment signposting them to appropriate services and responding to safeguarding concerns and disclosures appropriately The researchers communicated with participants and potential participants using their professional details and names through the project phones and by email rather than providing any personal contact details The research team was also prepared to respond to potential instances where a participant might frequently contact the project team and or request to speak with a specific team member We had no instances of this occurring During COVID remote interviews continued to be conducted as researchers worked from home To support staff members involved in contacting participants and conducting interviews all communication and planned calls continued to be documented in a shared calendar and tracking system so that all project team members were aware of when contact occurred The staff members continued to have weekly check ins and regular opportunities for debriefing In March LEG representatives and SSC members recognised the growing effects of conducting the research on those interviewing participants and engaging with data including screening a large number of studies for evidence reviews The LEG and SSC recommended the introduction of regular supervision for staff members In response external clinical supervision was implemented every weeks from May to ensure the staff members were well supported throughout the project NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Data management A comprehensive data management plan was developed for our studies involving data collection We regularly monitored our processes regarding where and for how long personal data and anonymised data sets were stored as well as who had access to these data To manage the personal data and safety notes of participants in our year cohort study a secure tracking system was developed for use by staff members who were interviewing participants enabling accurate recording and tracking of participants personal data such as their contact details when they were due follow up interviews and information about safety concerns this included the RAG system and any actions implemented Patient and public involvement Background Patient and public involvement refers to involving patients members of the population directly or indirectly affected by the target problem and or members of the public in the research process In MESARCH we worked with survivors of sexual violence and abuse While a research context could be empowering and beneficial to survivors in their recovery from trauma negative engagement could lead to re traumatisation The use of PPI to shape how research with survivors is carried out can lead to high quality practice and positive experiences for participants However previous research suggests that there is considerable scope for improving the quality of PPI in sexual violence and abuse research Our research aimed to advance practice in this area Methodology Drawing on principles of co production we worked in partnership with those with lived experience of sexual violence and abuse referred heretofore as the MESARCH LEG MESARCH reflects the shift to research being carried out collaboratively with members of the public who share decision making rather than models of lay consultation and tokenistic involvement Several theoretical positions underpinned our approach First we value a multiplicity of knowledge and have afforded great weight to experiential knowledge within the research process thus creating opportunities for epistemic justice a concept coined by philosopher and feminist Miranda Fricker where voices that are often silenced or marginalised are amplified Second building and maintaining strong relationships with the LEG was central to our approach to lived experience involvement premised on theories of relational engagement dialogical ethics and an ethics of care and reflecting the significance of the human and socially interactive element of engagement Lastly drawing on the concepts of citizenship and democracy the active and meaningful involvement of those with lived experience of sexual violence and abuse in our research promotes the empowerment of survivors This is particularly relevant in relation to involving survivors of sexual violence and abuse who will have experienced disempowerment through abuse communities and institutions To ensure good practice in involving survivors of abuse and trauma in our research we worked closely with Survivors Voices a survivor led organisation that harnesses the expertise of people affected by abuse drawing on their Charter which details principles and good practice for good survivor engagement in research We were also guided by the Rape Crisis National Service Standards adapting a set of quality service standards to meet the needs of survivors of sexual violence and abuse These principles provide a framework against which we have monitored the extent to which our research is trauma informed and achieves authentic survivor focus Methods Our LEG was supported by a dedicated public engagement officer to enable a co design and co production approach across the project LEG members were recruited through survivor support groups delegates at conferences participants on related research studies and recommendations from other researchers Over the lifecycle of the project the group included members participating at different times and brought hours of expertise into the project Members of the LEG were diverse across sex age ethnicity sexuality education employment and life opportunities They brought a wide range of professional and lived expertise as well as various engagement with the CJS NHS therapies Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for

recognising the association between diversity and gains being achieved across the research The involvement of the LEG in the project was guided by a terms of reference document that was co produced and regularly reviewed Involvement was enhanced through formal meetings administered through the lead university participation of two LEG members in SSC meetings to provide a lived experience perspective and contribute to the oversight of the project and ongoing communication through other means as and when it was required The work of the LEG was fully resourced by the NIHR covering people s time travel childcare expenses and conference attendance We also engaged with survivor support groups organisations led by survivors specialist sexual violence and abuse organisations and key stakeholders to further embed PPI across the project Patient and public involvement activity across the project lifecycle Patient and public involvement was embedded across all aspects of the project from its design and delivery to the interpretation and sharing of the findings see Figure Pre award We held a stakeholder event to integrate perspectives from a wide array of third sector organisations and administered a survey in collaboration with a charity that supports survivors of sexual trauma to gather views on research aims and methods The results shaped our choice of primary outcome use of incentives and plan for examining post crisis care We secured a PPI grant which enabled us to co create a vision for the project with survivors and service users we built partnerships with the charity sector and we created a leadership team to include survivorship alongside academic and practice based experience Study set up From the outset and throughout the project high quality training that met gaps in skills and knowledge for teams was critical The research team and LEG participated in five bespoke training sessions delivered by survivor led organisations specialist sexual violence organisations and members of the LEG The training sessions addressed safeguarding issues deepened the ability to understand trauma and respond in a research setting enhanced the research skills of the LEG to enable them to work effectively with the research team and promoted well being and self care We worked with the LEG and sexual violence and abuse charities to optimise not only how we engaged with target service users and survivor participants but also the quality of participation experiences This included developing and refining the safety protocol see Ethics the interview schedules for the cohort study and embedded qualitative study and the participant facing documentation Initiation of the CYP study led to connecting with a local sexual violence and abuse charity where the young people age range years worked with us to design and develop the methods for the CYP study through a series of workshops Recruitment There are particular challenges to reaching survivors for research purposes even where that research offers the prospect of improved health and well being through psychosocial interventions to the individual When the research is observational there is a less apparent benefit to participation Extensive groundwork and reflection was needed to co produce a narrative for engagement with survivors and draw people safely and ethically to the research The LEG was central to identifying and resolving moral questions and dilemmas about the undertaking the research in addition to some of the more pragmatic details of connecting with survivors safely and achieving participation and retention rates needed from a scientific viewpoint Our recruitment videos co designed and featuring LEG members are a good example of a practical response to

the LEG members themselves as captured in the testimony of one member see Appendix Box LEG members also told us that being part of the group has contributed to recovery by enabling safe exposure to triggers The conversations and interactions online by email in person and in print that were part of the everyday work of the project normalised talking about sexual violence and abuse Members have also commented on how being involved in MESARCH and being heard by MESARCH amplifies individual voices and provides a platform for creating change and being part of influencing better responses to others affected by abuse PPI also enhanced the research team s confidence to undertake this work deepening our understanding in relation to trauma and abuse and our LEG members commitment to the project was hugely motivating for overcoming the challenges encountered during the project Our work with the PPI group has also inspired future research around understanding long term physical health outcomes for survivors of sexual violence and abuse and influencing the implementation of trauma informed practice across the NHS considering clinical services beyond mental health building a toolkit of methods for doing better research in this field and growing the evidence base on novel interventions for survivors that reflect survivors individual needs and preferences In an effort to identify any gaps in our PPI provision in MESARCH we commissioned an independent survivor led organisation to evaluate it A summary of the conclusion reached by Survivors Voices is provided in Box BOX A Better Way findings from external evaluation of survivor involvement in MESARCH In the MESARCH team approach we found key features of trauma informed research careful attention to creating a safe environment genuine care for survivors and a commitment to authentic and empowering involvement that amplified the voices of survivors Using the evaluation tools of the Survivor Charter and Involvement Ladder we have gathered clear evidence of trauma informed practice in the approach of the MESARCH team This enabled and supported survivors to make a vital contribution to the project as both participants and co producers centering lived experience at the heart of the research Key strengths were a strong attention to creating a safe environment and demonstrating genuine care for survivor well being built on trustworthy relationships Their commitment to authentic engagement involving survivors as both participants and co producers empowered survivors and researchers This meant the team could successfully amplify the voices of survivors bringing the validity and impact of lived experience to trauma abuse and violence research Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et

No Chapter Evidence synthesis We conducted two complementary Cochrane Reviews to synthesise the evidence of the effects of psychosocial interventions on mental health and well being for survivors of sexual violence and abuse The term psychosocial used in this research refers to interpersonal or informational activities techniques or strategies that target biological behavioural cognitive emotional interpersonal social or environmental factors with the aim of improving health functioning and well being This includes the types of interventions that may be offered to survivors by SARCs and by other services in the voluntary sector the NHS or privately The first review combined published randomised trials from various parts of the world that examined the effects of interventions designed to support adults in the aftermath of rape sexual assault or abuse The second review combined qualitative studies of adult and child survivors of sexual violence and abuse to develop a picture of service users and family members experiences of interventions as well as the perspectives of the professionals who delivered them The reviews are referred to as published articles that include detailed descriptions of the methodologies used studies analysed across both reviews and the findings Our findings underscore the importance of access to psychosocial interventions in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse as a range of psychosocial interventions were effective at improving the mental health and well being of survivors in the short term These include traditional trauma focused approaches such as those recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE guidance e g cognitive behavioural therapy CBT and Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing EMDR which showed the strongest effects for mental health non trauma focused approaches and several emerging areas such as Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories RTM trauma sensitive or trauma informed yoga Lifespan Integration and cognitive training e g neurofeedback Although survivors said that they often found interventions difficult they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits These included positive effects on their physical health mood understanding of trauma and interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re engage with a wide range of valued life domains Survivors highlighted a range of features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered that had an impact on how they accessed and experienced interventions This included organisational features such as staff turnover that could influence survivors engagement with interventions the setting or location in which interventions were delivered and the characteristics of those delivering the interventions Therefore listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions at the right time for individuals can make a significant difference to their health and well being These findings provide support for NHSE s aim to provide lifelong support for survivors of sexual violence and abuse with SARCs being a vital option as a first point of care Our Cochrane Reviews have been translated for a range of audiences and are accessible here www coventry ac uk research areas of research centre for intelligent

was launched in and aimed to advance the support to victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse across England enabling people to recover heal and rebuild their lives SARCs are a vital first point of care within this strategy Service Specification identifies the core services that should be delivered within SARCs including assessment FMEs and health and well being interventions Nevertheless SARCs in England vary considerably in the types of organisations that lead them the staff members who work within them and the care and support services that they provide SARCs are further differentiated based on whom they support with some providing care to adults some to children and others to survivors of all ages Within this context we know very little about how staff experience this work and its variation although we do know that this work can have an emotional toll Furthermore while rates of access to SARCs in England and service users characteristics have been reported elsewhere understanding about survivors experiences of SARC services has been limited One small study reported that SARCs were experienced as a safe haven calming and welcoming and where survivors felt supported and understood In light of these gaps the first aim of this study was to identify key issues and concerns associated with the work of SARCs their workforce and the use of technologies SARC service delivery was severely affected by the COVID pandemic which also witnessed shifts in the type and incidence of sexual violence and abuse Given that our research coincided with the COVID pandemic period we were able to examine the effect of COVID pandemic on SARC service delivery and document the innovation that occurred These findings are reported elsewhere Sexual assault referral centres act as an initial point of contact therefore it is vital that the care and support provided to survivors of sexual violence and abuse is of the highest possible standard and that there is continuity of care beyond SARCs SARCs in England sit within a large and complex network of organisations and professionals that reflect the widespread needs of survivors at different stages receiving referrals from these organisations and professionals and referring SARC clients to them While inter agency and inter professional collaboration has been explored for some years across professions such as social work knowledge regarding collaboration across professionals in the SAAS context is limited A small amount of relevant research has been conducted in the USA but only one example has been described in a European context and none in England Furthermore survivors perspectives have been largely absent in this research Therefore a second aim of this research was to explore the integration of SARCs in the broader context of a health and community response to sexual violence and abuse drawing on perspectives of both professional and service user stakeholders Methods Study design overview The main component of this study was a process evaluation of SARCs A process evaluation is broadly recognised as a method that seeks to understand the work of an intervention how that intervention is delivered and its effect alongside contextual factors that may affect outcomes In completing this process evaluation we undertook qualitative investigation of professional and survivor voices regarding SARC service delivery and integration of SARCs within the SAAS pathway From the mapping of all SARC sites in England we identified several diverse sites to undertake the qualitative enquiry Data used to map SARCs were collected between March and July These data were supplemented with national SARC indicators of performance SARCIPs data supplied by NHSE and gathered from Copyright

EVALUATION OF SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES SARCs between April and April Data were collected from professionals and survivors participating in the qualitative study between July and July We also drew upon qualitative data gathered with survivors as part of the linked cohort study see Chapter between September and May Changes to protocol We planned to use Normalisation Process Theory an effective approach when exploring a new intervention or service However when it came to applying Normalisation Process Theory to our data the services staff and integration of SARCs were not newly implemented Therefore we sought an alternative theoretical approach to capture the importance of effective integration between different organisations and professionals and drew upon theory related to inter professional collaboration Theoretical approach Bronstein s theory of interdisciplinary collaboration has been applied extensively across other fields and in two studies exploring integration within Dutch and United States US models of SARC provision Coordination and collaboration have been hypothesised to be linked with the effectiveness of Sexual Assault Responses Teams in the USA These studies point to the theory s relevance to capturing interdisciplinary collaboration and integration for SARCs in England Bronstein defines interdisciplinary collaboration as a process that facilitates the achievement of goals that cannot be achieved by individual professionals Bronstein s model comprises five components interdependence newly created professional activities flexibility collective ownership of goals and reflection on process Interdependence refers to the dependence between and reliance upon different professionals in working together to achieve their own goals and requirements Newly created professional activities are collaborative acts programs or structures that can help achieve more than that if undertaken independently by professionals Flexibility captures deliberate acts of role blurring in which professionals working together can achieve greater efficiency and effective working Collective ownership of goals relates to a shared responsibility among professionals to achieve goals with a commitment to client centred care Finally reflection on process relates to professionals acknowledging their collaborative roles and evaluating how to effectively achieve and strengthen these relationships Bronstein argues that inter professional collaboration can be affected by several characteristics including professional role e g clear and well defined roles structural characteristics e g manageable workloads personal characteristics e g how collaborators perceive each other and history of collaboration e g prior experiences of collaboration Previous research has highlighted challenges to inter professional collaboration for example perceived power imbalances and different professional focus orientations between staff members these challenges will be explored in the context of this research Sampling recruitment and participants We mapped SARCs across England using data collected from SARC managers through an online survey sites returned data and SARCIPs data We produced a data set which allowed sampling of sites for the qualitative process evaluation and the cohort study see Chapter Using this data set we recruited a stratified random sample of seven SARCs from all sites with strata defined according to service delivery model police led NHS led charity led or private sector size small medium and large and level of integration of services on site embedded ISVA service or not At each site we invited a range of professionals based at the SARC to participate in an audio recorded interview We also approached professionals external to the SARCs whose organisations were part of inward and onward referral pathways We recruited directly through the UK Association of Forensic Nurses to ensure representation of Forensic Nurse Examiners FNEs within the sample We also invited survivors who had attended these SARC sites through the staff We undertook interviews with professionals see Appendix Table Five interviews were conducted with survivors initially We subsequently recognised the wealth of qualitative data being gathered as part of our cohort study NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No in reference to accessing care at SARCs see Chapter The qualitative data from our cohort study provided data from a further survivors who accessed SARCs including the eight SARCs where we undertook the in depth evaluation of SARC services Analysis Thematic analysis TA was the chosen process for analysing the two sources of data in depth interviews with survivors and professionals n and data arising from asking open ended questions about care during the baseline cohort study interviews n Specifically Braun and Clarke s Reflexive TA approach was applied This method adopts a flexible and organic approach to coding and subsequent theme development and it is considered theoretically independent Primarily inductive coding was undertaken being led by the content of the data with semantic coding used the data are considered to represent the explicit meaning of the data The standard TA method was followed including familiarisation and initial code development clustering of codes to initial preliminary themes theme development and subsequent finalising of the thematic themes Coding was undertaken by four members of the team and during the initial coding phase regular meetings were undertaken to inform develop and refine the coding book Once all the initial coding was completed one team member checked all codes for quality purposes and to ensure that the data fitted to the code label This process also refined codes into preliminary themes The analysis then focused on key themes that explained the research questions in ensuring that these themes were distinct and closely aligned to the data Results Overall and as set out in the qualitative data presented in Chapter survivors identified accessing SARCs as a positive approach in their recovery journey Recovery journeys are rarely linear or uniformly positive but survivors relayed that their encounters with SARCs and other specialist services fulfilled what survivors want from services and professionals in the aftermath of abuse In light of the experiences of professionals as well as those of SARC service users the following sections explore key issues concerns and strengths associated with the environment and organisational characteristics of SARCs examining the work they do the workforce technologies used and finally SARC integration within the wider community response to sexual violence and abuse The sections also pay particular attention to the interdisciplinary collaboration across profession al s within SARCs and between SARCs and other agencies focusing specifically on the key elements of Bronstein s model What is the work of SARCs including the types of interventions delivered Sexual assault referral centres provide a vital early or the first point of care for survivors and providing a frontline response to survivors constitutes the majority of their work There is a standard care offering at SARCs based on Service Specification In the research survivors focused on the elements of core services that were salient for them Crisis support was strongly valued by participants the emotional support information and options presented and the referrals made SARC staff tried their hardest not to cause me any more distress of course there was distress and it was uncomfortable but not their fault the FME is an extremely demanding experience and for one participant akin to having a post mortem while you were still alive ISVA support which may be provided directly through SARCs was also highly valued particularly in relation to practical support through investigative and criminal justice proceedings and the techniques to support recovery Counselling increasingly offered through SARCs was considered a largely positive experience although wait lists to access counselling and the restrictions on the number of sessions meant that some survivors felt I was getting somewhere and then it has to stop I didn t think it was good enough that it stopped Another core function of SARCs is access to other services SARCs opened a range of referrals for clients However drawbacks were I was getting bombarded with a lot of people calling me I had five or six agencies calling me the day after my phone didn t stop ringing and the consequence of this as I had to keep going over and over my story It was highlighted how survivors find it difficult to navigate the services and Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by

delivery manager While service specifications set out the core areas of delivery for SARCs variation arose with different leadership models commissioning arrangements geography and the needs of the local community Participants commonly identified typical journeys through SARC services They also noted divergence from primary routes Access needs and how people engaged with the services varied with individuals circumstances e g specific or complex needs location the time since the trauma occurred e g non recent abuse or CSA and external factors such as being on wait lists for therapeutic care and the status progression of criminal justice proceedings The research also documented the effects of the COVID pandemic which saw a step change in access and service provision and witnessed clear evidence of collaboration within and between the services as commented on by this FNE you can t deliver a service like this without being a close knit team While standard care requirements are set out for SARCs by NHSE there is much scope for additional work to enhance provision and access The research documented examples of SARC teams working creatively to ensure that their services could accommodate the range of needs of clients from different communities locally including those whose access to services had been delayed non linear or complicated by different factors One police officer demonstrated reflection on process in how they worked with their local SARC I attend the SARC a lot because if there s been an operational issue even though it may be north of the county I will get invited and then SARC manager and I and others will sit down and go ok how can we deal with this what can we do going forward to make sure that this doesn t happen again Teams developed new initiatives such as in house emotional support or counselling acting as a holding contact point while clients awaited access to other SAAS and other forms of care e g community mental health longer term counselling and enabling video interviewing live link technologies SARC staff expressed a commitment to clients we re here checking in or there s always someone here twenty four seven people do call us and say I m suicidal or I don t know where to turn to I haven t heard from this person They wanted to ensure that their services could support people at any point after sexual violence and abuse and they saw a role for being a point of contact for survivors of CSA and informing survivors about options for reporting and referrals to ISVA and third sector support SARCs expressed that efforts should be made to address public perception that SARC support means police involvement They demonstrated how self referral to services was fostered and also noted the ongoing difficulties for self referring survivors in terms of physically reaching their services in some areas of the country by contrast those who report to the police are usually transported to SARCs by police officers SARC staff operated in line with trauma informed care professionals were keen to see that choice was exercised in key areas such as reporting mechanisms as noted by this crisis worker I think it s really important to allow people that opportunity to validate what s happened to them to try and re balance regain some power in a situation where they ve felt powerless and to have that choice Staff highlighted the longer term storage of forensic data and anonymous submissions to police intelligence as an underutilised service In terms of people s access there was widespread endorsement of anonymous locations and for sites where survivors can provide alternative reasons for being there e g hospital site The staff members were aware that co location with police forces was challenging for survivors SARC buildings ranged from purpose built to adapted and survivor centred design features were strongly supported One such example was entering and exiting the space through alternative doors to signal the beginning and end of the SARC journey at services where clients generally do not return for other care and support Staff reported a range of issues with SARC estates from lack of physical and confidential spaces for client support and administrative work and shared entrance common corridors Forensic rooms were perceived as overly clinical and suggestions were made by professional and survivor participants to address this through features such as wall ceiling decorations The staff members reported efforts to ensure that the SARC was welcoming CYP that furniture was comfortable and that coverings provided to survivors were appropriate e g participants cited instances of gowns being transparent SARC teams expressed concerns about reaching clients in remote areas The shift to greater use of digital services NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No and remote care in response to the COVID pandemic had the effect of mitigating some of the geographical barriers affecting survivors access to SARCs and ISVA care Many survivors also identified a preference for remote contact with providers feeling more relaxed and that the distance of a telephone call is better for me when talking about difficult topics Who is the SARC workforce Across service delivery models staff roles generally seen at SARCs were SARC manager deputy and an administrative member team crisis workers and FMEs FNEs Flexibility in roles at SARCs was common my role covers a lot of areas for example managers and administrators trained as crisis workers Depending on the degree of integration at the site ISVAs enacted their roles in flexible ways as core staff at a SARC employed by the voluntary sector but co located at a SARC with largely visiting remote role or based physically at a voluntary sector organisation Thus many models could be drawn upon to suit the landscape for example some sexual health services have ISVAs NHS SARCs tended to employ clinical staff directly whereas private sector SARCs made greater use of staff banks With SARCs increasingly offering short term psychosocial interventions counsellors were also integrated into the staff of SARCs frequently on a part time co located basis Finally several roles were noted to lend themselves to specialisation with some sites training crisis workers and ISVAs to specialise in the care of particular groups for example CYP individuals with learning disabilities Within the scope of the current research we focus on two prominent workforce issues the nature of the crisis worker s role and related training and challenges to effective interdisciplinary SARC teams The crisis worker s main purpose is to support clients of the service However the role involves a diverse range of task and balancing the sensitivities of cases and needs and expectations of vulnerable clients with the constraints of what can be provided One morning I might be helping with a forensic medical and in the afternoon we might be doing call ups for email enquiries and reaching out to people that have accessed that way I think it s an incredibly difficult role to learn if I m honest because it s so varied and wide There are some repetitions within it that are very quick and easy to learn but there s other stuff that makes it much trickier like around geographical location So understanding what services are purchased in relation to paediatric FMEs in a geographical location which means that if somebody is ringing from name of city and they want to come in do we see them or not Or there s understanding and learning what the service offers outside of the area as well as in the area Crisis worker Without prior experience of the region crisis workers practice might suffer Training varied from across sites with most involving formal learning components for eample safeguarding and a period of shadowing my first client interaction that I shadowed it was kind of a steep learning curve because it s not like anything else crisis worker Shadowing and training more broadly was noted to be variable and rely on standards set by providers The crisis worker s role has not attracted much attention within the research literature beyond the toll it places on individuals an issue also recognised in our research While the role was consistently valued by service users for whom the crisis worker is the first SARC professional they encounter I found it helpful that I received emotional support from the crisis worker when I got there because it was scary and going with the police survivor professional participants viewed the role as lacking incentivisation e g opportunities for progression When a client or when a victim is at the SARC and you ve got private company who run forensic services and you ve got the police and you ve got a crisis worker surely all three agencies should be working together because we re supporting that one person SARC manager meeting the client s needs was a shared goal for staff at SARCs and there was frequent reference to we are quite a tight knit group ISVA However in terms of the challenges to effective interdisciplinary SARC teamsthe nature Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the

subcontracting of SARC roles on call zero hours contracts staff employed by different providers A crisis worker participant contrasted the scenario of where FNEs are employed directly by SARC and the experience of working with FNEs FMEs contracted on an on call basis the other doctors you only see them every now and then so you don t really build up the same rapport with them and obviously they all work slightly different try and suggest the way that you would do it normally just to try and make it easier and quicker because obviously we want to put the victims first so we want to make it easier for them I do think that it s so much better when you work together Implicit here is that placing survivors first requires effective teams and staff who are familiar with each other and the setting While all participants agreed that consistency in staffing was important for team working and reducing isolation flexible contracting was desirable for some professionals balancing other livelihoods and commitments SARC managers did have particular concerns about crisis workers in this regard crisis workers do an amazing job but I think they do just feel a little bit disconnected from the service Despite the workforce concerns that were voiced across the staff members and SARCs included in the study we found very high levels of intra SARC interdependence particularly among crisis workers and FNEs There was strong recognition of the importance of clear communication and inter professional respect supporting each other to reduce the impact of their work and a commitment to providing an integrated service to the client Simple examples such as gathering information from their clients together and sharing information between professionals as appropriate benefited clients in not having to repeat information or re tell about their experiences and evidenced newly created professional activities Collective ownership of goals in pursuit of client centred care represents a key aspect of effective interdisciplinary collaboration Reflecting the impact of this care one survivor commented I felt safe with the doctor I felt safe with crisis worker name who was in the room I didn t feel that anything bad was gonna happen What are the technologies that enable SARCs to get work done This section focuses on two key issues use of remote digital services in providing care and challenges emerging in information sharing across the services The advent of the COVID pandemic meant that SARCs used digital technologies to facilitate service delivery including triaging of clients before they attended the SARC Staff reported that they carefully determined the appropriateness of remote care for different clients Some benefits to triaging were realised in that clients spent less time at the SARC once they arrived Survivors reported both positive and negative responses to the increased use of digital technologies highlighting the need for developing remote services as part of a suite of options and tools The second key issue related to information sharing Different IT systems for different organisations meant that SARC staff members spent considerable time making manual referrals through online systems or secure email systems which added considerably to workload I referred a lady to adult social services because I felt her needs would be met with social care provider But I couldn t go direct with social care provider I had to go through adult social services and they have to make the referral And I was told on that phone call that somebody would be contacting you And today I ve not had a contact and it s been about two weeks so that s something that I am going to have to chase up So that is quite time consuming ISVA This work described by one SARC staff member as their nagging work was frequently highlighted with regard to sharing information with partner organisations Survivors experienced interruptions or delays in access to onward care I haven t received any care I got told I d have sexual health screening that hasn t been sorted or anything I had to go to the doctor s about getting an examination done they were supposed to help sort that out but they didn t Survivor NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No To what extent are SARCs embedded within the overall response to the needs of survivors of sexual violence and abuse The most important external partnerships for SARCs included the police sexual health ISVAs third sector and social care For example our data suggested well established and collaborative relationships between SARC staff and police officers Single point of contact officers in police forces worked directly with SARC managers to develop pathways for survivors and training by SARCs to ensure police officers understood local provision and access Collaboration with third sector organisations was more challenged with any multi agency working we all seem to work parallel with each other quite often and not come together at the top to deliver crisis worker There was a strong sense that collaboration was driven by individual senior members of staff at the SARC and or the partner organisation and involved local implementation Positive relationships at senior levels trickled down and fostered positive cross working seen to ultimately benefit survivors Examples of cross working included co delivery of training and sharing of resources and space Professionals expressed a wish for change For some implementing a more consistent SARC model was the answer with more services under one roof such as integrated ISVA and sexual health services Others recognised existing high quality provision in these areas within their communities and that pathways and relationships should be strengthened Another example was Achieving Best Evidence interviews with some believing these should be conducted consistently at SARCs while others saw SARCs as a place solely for acute crisis care and considered that survivors may not wish to return to these locations Participants pointed out that SARCs have all evolved in different ways in the communities they serve and in expressing how the sector needs to develop in the future emphasised the need for simplification and better approaches to supporting clients with complex needs The role of SARCs is vital but there was real concern about the invisibility of SARC services Survivors relied on the police and others to learn about SARCs I wouldn t have known about them if it hadn t been for the detective survivor In response to the lack of public awareness about SARCs there were several examples of teams initiating outreach services in their communities often targeting groups seen to experience even greater barriers to receiving help e g men minority communities Gaps in knowledge about service provision by SARC extended to important professional groups there are so many more people that need to know about the SARC crisis worker GPs were identified as a professional group lacking awareness of SARC services with referrals from GPs being infrequent This SARC manager talked about the difficulties of engaging with GPs Probably in defence of GPs they have just got so much demands on their time and they don t have free time so we ve put on training events especially for GPs We do the open days we try and target GPs some of them are just not aware of what we re doing they re really out of date the information that they are giving clients From the perspective of a survivor GPs have got such little understanding They don t take it in And then they re like we don t know who you can speak to they just don t know what the right support is Discussion Summary of main findings This work highlights the excellence in care and support being provided within SARCs as such the value of SARCs in the provision of care and support to survivors is supported The contribution of SARC provision to the care pathway extends beyond provision of forensic services importantly fulfilling an early role in coordinating care for survivors However this research also documents the challenges that SARCs and the SAAS sector as a whole experience in addressing survivors needs Drawing on interviews professionals survivors and survivor responses the novelty of this qualitative enquiry is evident in the breadth of participants spanning both inward and onward referral routes as well as SARC staff themselves along with the voices of survivors in sharing about the care and support they received Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care This is an Open

publication must be cited PROCESS EVALUATION OF SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES In addressing the first aim of this work findings have highlighted key issues and concerns associated with the work of SARCs their workforce and the use of technologies In doing so this research documents the high level of dedication of SARC staff and captures their commitment to client centred care and an ethos consistent with trauma competent practice This commitment of professionals at SARC was further evidenced in their response to the COVID pandemic where they effectively utilised technology to ensure that care could be continued while enabling greater flexibility and choice for survivors Appreciating several distinct roles are involved in producing the range of care and options for survivors our findings emphasised crisis workers as vital to a survivor s care journey at SARC Attention to the crisis worker role is fundamental in further developing the workforce of SARCs We found evidence of effective interdisciplinary collaboration spanning across Bronstein s five components of interdependence newly created professional activities flexibility collective ownership of goals and reflection on process both within SARCs and across the sector Despite being hampered by the complexity of how different services are contracted SARC staff worked hard to achieve cohesive teams and ensure that an excellent service is provided for their clients We saw many examples of work that reflected good quality inter professional collaboration specifically inter dependence and collective ownership of goals in delivering client centred care Matthew and Hulton called for research to identify whether there is a link between effective SARC collaborative practice and survivors experiences of SARC services This research answers that call with our findings showing high levels of effective inter professional collaboration found between SARC staff specifically between crisis workers and FMEs FNEs and subsequent positive endorsement of SARCs by survivors However there were factors that can hamper inter professional working within SARC settings The ways in which professional roles at SARC are commissioned can lead to short term teams and unstable working hours of staff whereby collective ownership of goals in pursuit of client centred care is difficult to achieve In comparison consistent teams enabled strong inter professional working and evidenced best practice This generated cultures of transparency and respect more compassionate support and offered a high quality experience of care for survivors Across the sector and moving beyond the SARC setting the second aim of the research was to explore the integration of SARCs in the broader context of a health and community response to sexual violence and abuse In doing so our research gave a positive picture of interdisciplinary collaboration across the wider sector across criminal justice health and third sector organisations Professionals across these sectors clearly engaged in collective ownership of goals in recognising the importance of effective and cohesive care and support for survivors This runs counter to US research where research noted cross system coordination being non existent or lacking consistency with subsequent challenges to the effectiveness of SARC provision and integration However barriers remain primarily in the form of inefficient communication systems for sharing information Effective information sharing systems were highlighted as being critical to enabling strong inter professional working and importantly contributed to efficient working practices reducing the workload burden of SARC staff However this study has demonstrated challenges to optimising the access to and fully realising the benefits of SARC services specifically relating to the invisibility of SARCs SARCs need to be more apparent as a care option for those in crisis particularly if the person experienced rape sexual assault or abuse recently This includes wider community awareness e g families workplaces friends of survivors given patterns of disclosure in personal social networks It is paramount that public awareness of SARCs is prioritised for example through investment in public awareness campaigns This is particularly important for groups of survivors who are underrepresented at SARCs and experience barriers to accessing them NHSE made efforts to address this problem with a campaign in targeting specific groups including black and Asian women men and survivors from lesbian gay bisexual transgender and or queer LGBTQ communities with a focus on youth across these groups A broader campaign was also run in South East England targeting all ages NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Strengths and limitations The study s originality resides in the breadth of the experiences brought to bear on questions about the role and effectiveness of SARC services with input from SARC professionals and stakeholders outside of SARCs as well as the voices of survivors who have accessed SARCs in England While prior work has explored aspects of the work captured this study benefited from the large scale nature of data collection which allowed triangulation of experiences of multiple informants There were important gaps in representing those inside SARCs medical examiners The study also lacked GPs and social workers two professional groups that are integral to early intervention in sexual violence and abuse Implications for health care Enhancing the visibility of SARCs among professionals The findings highlight the need for awareness raising work to be continued and further developed in reaching survivors across all parts of England However gaps in awareness of SARCs specifically highlighted in GPs critically need to be addressed For example current heavy GP workloads may mean that more traditional methods of awareness raising in professional groups at a local level will not be effective Instead more thought should be given to developing collaborative relationships at higher levels e g Integrated Care Boards British Medical Association General Medical Council Royal College of General Practitioners with a clear pathway to facilitating GPs and SARCs to develop local collaborative relationships In summary survivors need to be able to make informed and empowered choices about their crisis care and thereafter Professionals being able to signpost survivors to SARCs provides survivors the option to benefit from specialist knowledge and referral pathways at minimum Our findings also suggested that the physical visibility of SARCs needs further attention for example Walker et al recognised a need to balance accessibility and discretion in locating SARCs Valuing and developing collaboration In other words strong collaborative relationships between SARC staff and other agencies translated into high quality care and support for survivors As highlighted in the National Service Specification SARCs are a mainstream provision linked to other care pathways and must achieve strong partnerships across health and social care the specialist sexual violence and abuse services in the voluntary sector and the CJS However the effectiveness of this collaboration and partnership was affected by two issues Firstly the nature of relationships between SARCs and their partner organisations frequently relied on individual relationship building Bronstein highlights personal characteristics as a factor that can strengthen inter professional collaboration where professionals who view each other with trust respect understanding and engage in informal communication can engage in much more successful collaborations We interviewed many professionals who exemplified this good practice in the way in which they worked with other individuals This translated into effective and efficient working that assisted over burdened service delivery However the sustainability of these benefits is threatened by staff changes Decision makers may want to consider how relationships between agencies can be developed sustainably Secondly inefficient information sharing substantially increased the workloads of professionals There is a need for significant financial investment which simplifies information sharing uncovered a bestWhile it is unlikely that a simple solution exists decision makers need to consider how IT interfaces between organisations could be facilitated and also promote reflection on reviews of referral pathway processes that may be unnecessarily complex This is particularly key given that it has an impacton survivors when their care is disrupted delayed or stopped due to issues with information sharing The commissioning process for SARC staff and the contracting of SARC services and services in the wider sector did not always support staff to collaborate effectively We consider that a secure workforce should be an aim for commissioners in this area Our work has not uncovered a best practice model to achieve this e g one SARC model of staffing that should be promoted

commissioning processes However at a local level two key aims should be focused upon The first is that commissioning should be undertaken more collaboratively across all relevant sectors e g public health criminal justice local government so that there is more coherence to the way in which services are contracted across local regions Secondly commissioners and integrated care boards should review these structures and specifically the processes between organisations with a view to simplification and to reduce barriers that aggravate workloads Recommendations for research Given the gaps in including informants from social work and general practice future research could examine the specific challenges these professional groups perceive in participating in a community response to sexual violence and abuse Furthermore while this research has identified excellent practice in relation to collaboration continued research attention is needed to evaluate these practices to ensure that this captures the complexity of how SARC services are delivered both nationally and internationally Overall we hope to have highlighted the dedication and creativity of staff delivering client centred care and support in the SAAS sector which was reflected in survivors experiences of high standards of care across the sector NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF

for commercial use provided the original work is properly cited See creativecommons org licenses by The text below includes minor additions and formatting changes to the original text Background A cohort study formed a key part of the evaluation of SARCs It is the most comprehensive study of health and well being in a British SARC population being the first to follow up health and well being outcomes in adult cohort and is one among the small number of prospective longitudinal studies internationally involving survivors of rape sexual assault and abuse It takes access to SARCs as the starting point for the cohort It aims to describe the health and service use journeys of survivors in the year after SARCs and examines how the mental health needs of survivors were met in voluntary sector and NHS settings The study uses a multilevel modelling framework to explore risk factors for burden of PTSD symptoms at baseline and reduction in symptoms during the year after to determine whether SARC service models and subsequent care influence outcome and to identify whether participant level factors moderate outcome Methods Study design overview The study design and methods have been published in a protocol study This was a cohort study of mental physical sexual health and cost outcomes over year in adult survivors of rape sexual assault and abuse who had received care through SARCs in England Quantitative measures were implemented at baseline weeks after index SARC access and at and months post baseline The study also gathered qualitative responses at each time point related to quality of care Recruitment commenced in September and the last month interview was conducted in December Changes to protocol The main deviation from the protocol V is that loss to follow up was even greater than anticipated We interviewed only people at months instead of the projected people We did however reach the target sample size at baseline Our cohort underwent several changes before V to cope with challenges to recruitment and these are tabulated in the study protocol Briefly the most significant amendments to our original protocol were reduction in the target sample size from to and reduction in the follow up of years to months each due to the difficulties reaching a trauma population The COVID pandemic triggered a change in inclusion criteria eligibility no longer required service users to present in person at SARC services and we also began to admit self referrals into the research as opposed to requiring referral by a professional Early consultations with our SSC and LEG see Chapter after the study launch led to additions changes in measures for example we added assessments of eating problems suicidality self harm drug use and capability We also changed the minimum age for entry into the cohort study from to years because care pathways are different for those under years and it was seen as a better approach to focus on young people separately see Chapter Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health and

the DOI of the publication must be cited HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF SURVIVORS AFTER ACCESSING SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES Sampling recruitment and procedures Using data supplied by NHSE and based on our process evaluation study see Chapter we divided all SARCs in England into strata based on service delivery model size and level of integration of services Next we randomly selected sites from strata and approached them to participate In line with our planned site recruitment SARC sites joined the research We also recruited of their onward referral partners mainly ISVA services because the primary recruitment model relied on referral of SARC service users to research by ISVAs The requirement to recruit this number of SARC referral partners was unanticipated we intended to have more of the major SARC sites nationally where ISVAs are employed by SARCs and deliver care on site and therefore make referral to the research more seamless However several of these sites were already participating in another NIHR funded study Recruitment of individuals was undertaken in three phases the first involved SARC staff screening service users for eligibility People were considered eligible if they were service users at SARC aged years and had presented in person at any of the participating sites After March the research welcomed survivors who accessed SARC services remotely as well as self referrals these being participants who had not necessarily accessed one of the originally recruited SARC sites The main implication of this was that we could not collect service use data about participants from those sites in most cases we asked the participants for the information where appropriate and safe to do so e g What date did you access the SARC Who was the perpetrator of the offence Returning to the main model of recruitment people were excluded by services if in exercising their own judgement the responsible member of SARC staff conducting screening anticipated a service user may be too unsafe to participate or may encounter difficulties in providing informed consent due to severe mental health cognitive or learning problems We also excluded those who were incarcerated as conducting follow up assessments in prisons was outside the scope of the project Sexual assault referral centre staff completed a screen form for all those aged years presenting to the service recording basic demographic data and offence and referral characteristics and indicating whether the person was eligible or not with any reasons for exclusion indicated These screen forms were assigned a study identification number containing no identifying information and passed onto the project team to provide an indication of the characteristics of the pool of service users pre enrolment SARCs routinely refer on to other agencies and nearly all survivors are offered access to ISVAs thus our approach was to train ISVAs working inside SARCs and in the voluntary sector to invite their clients referred from SARCs to consider joining the research We co produced recruitment materials with our LEG e g video which the ISVAs shared with their clients ISVAs gained consent to pass on the person s name and phone number and preferences for safe convenient contact to the research team Study identification numbers were passed on not only from the SARC to the research team but also from the SARC to ISVA services Thus when a person consented to be in the research we were able to link the person to the service data we held This minimised the number of questions including sensitive questions that we needed to ask A trained project team member established contact within week of receiving the consent from the ISVA or SARC or in a small number of instances other recruited sites settings such as sexual health and contact was made in line with service users preferences Once contact was made by the research team we followed our recruitment and safety protocols explaining the study purpose and gaining full consent see Chapter When consent to participate was established baseline data were collected and the person was enrolled in the cohort study Follow up was undertaken according to participants preferences and months after the baseline interview Sample size The primary outcome of interest for evaluating service user journeys after accessing a SARC was PTSD measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM PCL Our interpretation of models based on the PCL focused on what constitutes a minimal clinically important difference MCID for PTSD Stefanovics et al concluded that differences of approximately of a standard deviation SD could be deemed clinically important both cross sectionally and for within person change As NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No this study involved neither randomisation nor placebo control the analyses focused on changes in PTSD symptoms between baseline and follow up We considered the recommendations of Stefanovics et al in terms of quantifying the change score group difference we would expect that separates an effective treatment from an ineffective one Based on guidelines we anticipated this MCID of SD to approximate to a point difference on the PCL change score however Stefanovics et al propose that an SD based approach is more robust and we also recognised that the magnitude of change on the raw scale metric would be influenced by the length of time between baseline and follow up To allow for four levels in a predictor variable e g four types of SARC service provider up to covariates two time points an expected small to moderate Cohen s f which corresponds to the MCID for our primary outcome variable and an \u03b1 error probability of participants were required at study completion to achieve a power \u03b2 error probability of Based on previous studies our pilot research and early patterns of recruitment and retention we estimated attrition at by the month follow up requiring a baseline target of individuals Participants who did not complete a month follow up were still eligible to complete month follow up measures Data collection and outcomes The form used by SARC staff to screen service users for the research provided initial data on gender age ethnicity offence characteristics including nature of the relationship to the perpetrator and time since the offence occurred referral into SARC and indicators of vulnerability at the point of service access e g history of mental health problems disability substance use At baseline we collected additional detailed sociodemographic information Baseline data were gathered using computer assisted telephone interviews by staff trained in survivor centred research practice see Chapter We enquired about adverse childhood experiences ACEs using the World Health Organization s ACE International Questionnaire which measures exposure to adverse experiences under the age of years We screened for lifetime intimate partner violence as well as in the year up to baseline using the Afraid Controlled Threatened Slapped or physically hurt Screening Measure tool All other measures applied at baseline focused on standardised timeframes and were used to assess change in survivors health and well being journeys over the year period see Table Sexual health will be reported elsewhere Our approach to measuring costs is outlined in the economic evaluation see Chapter After enquiring about service use at each timepoint we asked participants to rate the extent to which four different sectors services SARC voluntary sector NHS policing and justice had been beneficial neutral or harmful to their health and well being using a scale that extended from minus maximum harm to plus maximum benefit Qualitative methods In addition to the quantitative measures and scales indicated above interviews also included open ended questions about participants experiences of care and support in the context of four different sectors This produced an extensive longitudinal qualitative data set to complement the quantitative data One of the study aims was to explore how survivors experienced mental health care in the NHS compared to the voluntary sector As there was so much overlap and movement of participants between voluntary and statutory mental health services it was not possible to examine this aim quantitatively Thus we applied Braun and Clarke s Reflexive TA approach see Chapter to examine our longitudinal qualitative data set Statistical methods Descriptive and unadjusted analyses Baseline sociodemographic offence and trauma related characteristics for the sample were summarised using means and SDs for continuous variables and using ns and proportions for nominal and ordinal level variables Using the chi squared test of independence and the independent t test we assessed for any differences in the baseline characteristics between participants who were lost to follow up from the study at months and those who were retained We also calculated the levels for the

the data on harm and benefit of services for four different sectors SPSS V IBM Corporation Armonk NY USA was used to conduct all descriptive analyses A multilevel modelling framework Unless otherwise stated risk factors and auxiliary variables were selected from the baseline wave of data collection see Box Our research focused on exploring risk factors for PTSD symptoms measured at baseline and reduction in symptoms during the year following the baseline assessment Because of the repeated measures nature of these data with up to three measurements for each participant we employed linear mixed effects models to describe heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of change Therefore we used the lme function from the nlme package in R statistical software The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Vienna Austria using Rstudio see Report Supplementary Material A mixed effects model partitions variance in PTSD symptoms into within participant and between participant variances Fixed effects describe the average pattern of change in symptoms across the year typically a linear or more complex polynomial while random effects represent variation around this population mean trajectory for instance the extent to which a particular individual aligns with higher or lower than average at baseline intercept variability and observes a reduction in symptoms at a slower or faster rate than the average for the sample slope variability Following the estimation of the unconditional model described above we incorporated a succession of risk factors to determine whether each in turn was associated with either intercept or slope differences For this we focused on the maximal sample of those participants providing any PCL data at any wave We fit a univariable mixed effects model for each risk factor By introducing a main effect of each risk factor as well as an interaction between this factor and time we derived parameters for both baseline symptom level and symptom change Parameters represented mean differences in each quantity for categorical risk factors and a symptom difference for a unit increase in x for any continuous risk factors e g total ACE score As multi category risk factors could yield a large number of separate parameters in these models we used Wald tests to produce a pair of Omnibus tests one representing the null hypothesis for a lack of association between x as a whole and the baseline symptom level and the other for the association between x and the slope BOX Variables used in the analysis Organisational level a ISVA SARC or non

data that might lead to bias and we have described our approach to these aspects see Report Supplementary Material Results Characteristics of the setting and flow of participants through the study Overall people were recruited into the cohort study It was later determined that two of these individuals referred into the research by ISVAs and participating up to the month interview had not actually accessed a SARC their data were excluded from analyses Figure shows the flowchart forparticipants in the different stages of the study commencing with screening for eligibility at SARCs The sample of people had accessed care at different SARCs featuring all four of the models of service delivery under investigation participants had attended or otherwise accessed care from a SARC led by private sector companies sites accessed care at NHS led SARCs five sites participants had accessed a police led SARC four sites and participants had accessed charity led SARCs two sites Six of these sites affecting experiences of service users had integrated ISVA services whereas accessing any of the other SARCs affecting service users would have required service users to utilise ISVA care in settings external to the SARC usually charity sector but we did have some ISVA services located in sexual health There was a high variability in the cluster sizes i e the number of participants linked to each of the sites ranging from to with an average of This variability was due to varying levels of commitment to the research by SARCs but mainly by the ISVAs on whom we relied for referrals Occasionally a participant self referred to the research n and for one of these individuals the SARC they attended had not been formally recruited into the project thus adding a site Another situation arose when an ISVA referred a person in the usual manner but we determined that the person had actually accessed a SARC in a different geographic location i e location of the offence reporting Five individuals joined the study in this way generating five additional SARC sites Thus we had regions sites altogether six of which were generated through service users joining rather than the team recruiting the SARC and its referral partners first The most effective model from a research recruitment perspective was a committed ISVA team co located at the SARC The perception in the charity sector that the research was only concerned with SARC practice and related outcomes may have been a barrier to engaging with the project All agencies were remunerated for recruitment on a per client referred basis There was a high degree of variability across the sample in the period between a person s access to a SARC and participation into the study For of the sample a year or more had lapsed since they attended SARC Given how difficult it is to involve people from a trauma population in research especially observation research we had not applied an upper limit on time since SARC access

and respectively Eight per cent of the sample had attempted suicide in the month before the interview and self harmed in that period It is noteworthy that nearly of those with longstanding illness or disability that limited activity also had long term mental health problems In terms of offence characteristics of participants had reached the SARC for help after exposure to sexual abuse during childhood a quarter of people wanted to seek help for sexual violence perpetrated by partners or ex partners and the majority of people in the study sought help after assault by strangers or acquaintances Only under had been victimised as adults by family members other than partners or by persons in positions or trust or authority While most people reached SARCs through referrals by the police over a fifth of participants had contacted SARCs themselves The rest of the referrals were by the charity voluntary sector and a small number from general practice sexual health mental health education and social services The burden of trauma across the life course is summarised in Table The mean number of ACEs was range across the participants who answered the questions and nearly four fifths indicated exposure to four or more adverse experiences As indicated above more than of people sought help in relation to CSA however our research found that more than half of the sample had

of art therapy It was one of the highlights of my year I really liked it Each week we focused on a different medium of art The people who facilitated it an artist and a counsellor did it perfectly

were some instances where care had been extended I really didn t want to finish the counselling so he gave me more initially given sessions which was really good More commonly survivors could access only a finite number of sessions Survivors appreciated the immediate support for example crisis counselling where it was provided and interim support such as check in phone calls provided while waiting for longer term support However long waiting lists to access therapeutic support in the voluntary sector were often mentioned by survivors in addition to limited flexibility in appointment

about it I could cope with arguments with my partner and not have flashbacks It just means I don t have flashbacks any more However for other participants the mental health care they received did not

Certain therapies are not available All you get is the short term CBT DIT EMDR I tried all of these Things that could help me Gestalt are not available and I can t afford them so I am not going to get the treatment I need Participants were often unable to access the mental health care they needed within the NHS even if they were in considerable distress I was suicidal and I had plans They decided I wasn t in need of any help and closed the case or the only support offered was medication As with the voluntary sector survivors also experienced long waiting lists to access therapeutic support from the NHS Of particular concern were the experiences within the NHS of harmful professional attitudes that replicated rape myths and re traumatised survivors These problematic responses from professionals were not reported by participants in relation to the voluntary sector where organisations are more likely to be specialised sexual assault services Overall there were positive experiences of mental health care across both sectors and both sectors face capacity problems However the feedback from survivors suggests that there is greater scope within the voluntary sector for providing care that adequately meets the needs of survivors because of the variety and flexibility of support provided Mental health care from the NHS was often too difficult to access or was inappropriate for the often complex needs of survivors see Chapter Main model Missing data patterns and amount of available data The missing at random assumption on which the maximum likelihood approach to missing data is pinned not to mention the more ubiquitous multiple imputation pertains to beliefs about the difference between responders and non responders something that cannot be refuted using the observed data alone Nevertheless it can be helpful to investigate relationships between patterns and missingness and both model variables and auxiliary variables This research uses a string of zeros and ones to describe missingness patterns For example is attributed to individuals with all missing data for PCL is attributed to those who missed the final wave and is attributed to those with complete data When studying the observed data we have gatherd some evidence of an association between PCL score and missingness but the pattern is far from clear Our a priori belief might have posited that those with more severe symptoms at baseline would be less likely to remain in the study this is not what the data present For example Table shows participants who were lost to follow up after the first wave tended to have lower symptom scores rather than higher symptom scores at baseline and there were no overall differences related to the number of measures people completed see

estimates obtained from a trio of random intercept slope linear mixed effects models When we focused initially on the complete case sample of participants we observed an estimated mean symptom score of points at baseline and an average improvement i e reduction of points across the year follow up The baseline random effect has a variance of \u03c4 corresponding to an SD of indicating that we would anticipate of the participants to have symptom scores between i e and i e at the first wave The variance in slope is also substantial \u03c4 corresponding to an SD of indicating that we would anticipate of the participants to have an improvement in the range of to across the year of follow up The other role of the random effect SDs here is that they link back to the original power calculation and the quantification of the MCID The MCID for symptoms scores at baseline is at points on the PCL and the MCID for improvement across the year is approximately Finally it is worth commenting on the correlation between the two random effects \u03c1 which is modest in size and negative Thus there is a tendency for the variance in score to decrease over time or in other words greater improvements are observed among participants who entered the study with a greater burden of symptoms Changes are subtle if we move to the right in the table and introduce the participants who provided an incomplete set of PCL measurements We can observe the average yearly improvement reducing slightly to points which is to be expected given the previous observation that participants providing one measurement had slightly lower scores at baseline and the observation above that there is a negative correlation between baseline scores and the rate of improvement Multivariable models

from a single linear mixed effects model with the relevant interaction terms For all models presented a series of covariates has been included however their own parameter estimates are not shown The primary goal of model adjustment here is to address potential bias problems due to variation in the timing of response and loss to follow up The specific adjustments made for each risk factor are listed in the table footnote Finally results are shown for the sample of participants providing at least one measure of PCL across the three waves The analysis sample for each risk factor varies slightly because of a minor amount of missing data and this is also summarised in the footnote Organisational level factors There is little evidence here to suggest a relationship between PTSD as measured by the PCL and either the type of ISVA or the type of SARC However we will describe the information shown in the first table see Table to aid the interpretation of the subsequent tables which are in the same format For the first model ISVA location we observed that on average survivors who attended a SARC ISVA were estimated to be points lower on the PCL at baseline with a CI from points i e points lower to points i e points higher In terms of slope survivors attending a SARC ISVA had a point greater reduction in PCL however once again the CI was wide and the range of values consistent

here is a composite derived from data from all three waves see Table We derived an average value for each participant with the denominator depending on the number of variables collected three for those with complete data two for those with one missing wave and one for those with one variable usually only the baseline measurement The resulting scale was markedly skewed and was log scaled which rendered it normal in appearance While normality in independent variables is not necessary for inferential purposes it can be beneficial for improving the linearity of associations There is strong

level and little evidence of any service experience factor being related to improvement in symptoms across the year Characteristics of the individual and the offence We observed several factors from this third and final domain to be strongly related to baseline PTSD symptom level as measured by the PCL see Table Firstly each additional ACE is associated with a point greater score of symptoms at baseline CI to p and evidence of mental health issues with a point difference There is weak evidence p that a delay of at least days is associated with an approximately point greater symptom score and there is a similar level of evidence in support of an association for perpetrator type where it appears that where the perpetrator is the survivor s partner or other the baseline score is greater There is strong evidence p and an apparent dose response for symptoms being lower for those with greater financial resources and finally there is strong evidence p that being unable to work is associated with a point higher baseline score With regard to the slope model there is little worthy of note It is evident that the main determinant of improvement at least when quantified in this way is symptom burden at baseline While there is some evidence here that improvement is greater for those with more ACEs the structural equation model showed that this was being driven by the strong association between ACEs and baseline symptoms Discussion Summary of main findings The cohort study fulfils two major goals of the MESARCH project Firstly it addresses questions about the effectiveness of SARCs and the onward pathway of care adding longitudinal findings to several existing mixed methods in this field Second it enables analysis of health and well being journeys for survivors of sexual violence and abuse after contact with services We are not aware of any other UK based study that has followed up a sample of survivors of rape sexual assault and sexual abuse There are some longitudinal data available in relation to young survivors in the UK with smaller samples and shorter timescales and a small number of international studies with adults with the South Africa longitudinal study conducted by Abrahams et al being the closest in terms of design Participants in our cohort were SARC service users aged years They were largely similar to SARC service users nationally although this shifted somewhat in the wake of the COVID pandemic where people accessed SARCs remotely the time to care profile shifted and likely interacted with how the COVID pandemic led to reductions in some forms of sexual violence and abuse stranger and acquaintance assaults increases in other areas partner perpetrated and online forms and a pattern of non recent survivors such as survivors of CSA coming forward for help Our research captured this varied picture and recruited people approximately days after they had accessed a SARC Cohort participants were predominantly women and belonged to non minoritised ethnicities and their age ranged from to years Survivors reported a high burden of lifetime trauma Although suffering from ACEs is not deterministic having four or more ACEs is related to an increased likelihood of experiencing chronic health conditions such as cancer cardiovascular disease type diabetes respiratory diseases and poor mental health Notably in our study three quarters of participants had four or more ACEs contrasting sharply with rates of approximately reported in population based studies Nearly half of the survivors had pre existing mental health problems at the point of accessing SARC more than half had lifetime experience of attempted suicide had been prescribed psychotropic medications Although our sample had a good spread on socio demographic factors faced major daily financial problems For offence related factors there was weak evidence that a delay of more than days to SARC was associated with more PTSD symptoms and a similar

was greater The profile of perpetrators differed from ONS data on experiences of sexual violence and abuse nationally with a greater proportion of abuse among SARC service user by strangers and acquaintances over partners ONS data suggest that nearly half of the sexual violence and abuse cases is committed by partners This signals an access issue for survivors of domestic perpetrated sexual abuse Sexual assault referral centres and third sector agencies achieved consistently high standards of care for survivors across sub studies and harmful encounters were at a minimum This was in stark contrast to the NHS and police where the frequency of harmful experiences affected and of people who rated these sectors respectively and our qualitative studies have generated many insights into how to improve care in these settings Post traumatic stress disorder proportions and means at entry to our study were consistent with data cited at baseline in international intervention studies with survivors of sexual violence and abuse Seventy per cent of participants had probable PTSD and achieved important reductions at follow up points on the PCL equivalent to SD which was our threshold for judging a minimal clinically meaningful difference We found an important triad of risk between ACEs long term mental health problems and socio economic deprivation and these were the main predictors of PTSD at baseline A third of the original cohort was lost to follow up at year consistent with treatment studies in the field While those retained and lost differed on degree of socio economic deprivation people with more trauma symptoms at baseline were not more likely to leave the study We consider this to be an important observation and reflect the impact of our trauma informed research practice see Chapter The service use is described more fully in our economic evaluation see Chapter but there was strong evidence of a positive association between frequency of service use and symptom level at baseline This was also consistent with the ACEs related research on costs We observed a trend towards improvements on health measures for the sample over the year of the study While examining in depth aspects of health in our sample beyond PTSD is outside the scope of this research we present the QoL data as an example of what is emerging from our work When using the final timepoint for comparison the MESARCH cohort sample was found to have poor QoL across three of the four domains on the WHOQoL BREF relative to the general population In their study assessing the QoL in people with a variety of illnesses Skevington and McCrate reported the following scores for the WHOQoL BREF for the control group a sample of more than participants who were considered well Physical vs in MESARCH sample Psychological vs Social vs Environment vs It is noteworthy that there was no difference on environment related QoL in our sample that connects with important themes of access to health care and safe environments which we highlight about in Chapter This study did not detect differences in outcomes on PTSD at year by SARC service model accessed or on accessing a SARC provided ISVA This was an important finding and core part of our investigation Although there was a trend towards benefit from charity led SARCs over those led by the police NHS and private sector organisations we had too few service users accessing charity led SARCs to have confidence in this finding Without a control group we cannot demonstrate causality however it is promising to observe improvements among those that have accessed the SARC care pathway The main predictor of PTSD at months was the baseline score With of people still exhibiting PTSD symptoms over a year later that would interfere with their daily functioning there is still a gap in survivors accessing the right care for their recovery This is crucial to address to avoid future costs of violence especially given what our Cochrane Reviews have demonstrated in terms of the efficacy of interventions There is also wide evidence from our qualitative work of a range of novel and alternative treatments and therapies seen as acceptable and beneficial to survivors that may offer cost effective NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No ways of promoting good health and

families communities and societies are wide ranging and substantial There is a paucity of evidence on the outcomes of different interventions and programmes targeted at addressing sexual violence and abuse and on the costs associated with such violence Economic evidence is vital to ensure scarce public resources are used optimally Although the literature is limited in volume there has been some recent consideration of appropriate methods for economic evaluations in this area Economic evaluations aim to inform decisions by comparing the costs and outcomes of health interventions to ensure scarce resources are used in the best ways possible to improve health and well being Decision makers need to make difficult decisions around which programmes and interventions should be funded Very few economic evaluations of interventions and services focused on survivors of sexual violence and abuse have been undertaken and those that are published are often limited in their scope The aim of this component was to compare the costs and outcomes associated with different organisational aspects of SARC service delivery If some SARC models are more strongly associated with reducing PTSD and improving QoL and other mental physical and sexual health outcomes than others there are likely to be important cost implications for the healthcare sector for the wider public sector and for society as a whole Methods Resource use and costs For the initial analysis a UK NHS Personal Social Services perspective was adopted when conducting the economic analysis accordingly only direct costs to the health service social care and SARCs were deemed to be relevant This was followed by a wider analysis focusing on public sector resource use as a whole Resource use data were collected prospectively to estimate the costs associated with different models of SARC service delivery This included services attended after initial attendance at a SARC to capture the whole service pathway experienced by survivors The resource use monitored included the cost of service use within SARCs e g consultations treatment NHS and social care resource use after initial attendance at SARCs e g GP visits sexual health visits contacts with social workers This was distinct from the resource use within the NHS SARCs third sector resource use after initial attendance at SARCs e g counselling information and advice and wider public sector resource use for example in relation to housing and other social welfare systems Relevant unit costs for health resource use and treatments were identified from established national sources see Report Supplementary Material The total cost associated with each service pathway at different follow up points was estimated using a micro costing method where unit costs were assigned to the number of utilised resources As healthcare costs are substantially skewed CIs around mean differences were estimated using the bootstrap method All costs are expressed in UK currency for As necessary costs were inflated using the Hospital and Community Health Services Pay and Prices Index Discounting of costs and outcomes was not required as the study was concerned with a month period As no information was publicly available on the costs associated with services in terms of different types of SARCs police NHS charity and private led services we Copyright O Doherty et

assumed that there was no difference in the costs associated with resource use such as consultations across the various SARC types NHS led private etc There is currently considerable debate about the cost burden on different sectors but no definitive data are available on actual cost differences However all costs were varied extensively in the sensitivity analyses Health outcomes The primary clinical outcome for the MESARCH study was participant reported PTSD symptoms collected using the PCL see Chapter Self reported health related QoL was assessed via the EuroQol Dimensions five level version EQ D L questionnaire completed by participants at baseline and follow up points The EQ D instrument is a preference based measure consisting of five dimensions mobility self care usual activities pain discomfort and anxiety depression The EQ D instrument was selected as it is recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence NICE and has been used for patients experiencing PTSD and in other similar contexts Following NICE guidance utility values were calculated by mapping the L descriptive system data onto the L value set The mapping function developed by van Hout et al was used for the analysis to allow consistency with NICE recommendations The mapping function uses data obtained from a survey of the UK population to derive a utility based value Following the trapezium rule the generated score was used to calculate quality adjusted life years QALYs gained at months to inform analysis of costs and utility The ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults ICECAP A instrument was used to measure capability wellbeing The instrument consists of the following five attributes stability an ability to feel settled and secure attachment an ability to have love friendship and support autonomy an ability to be independent achievement an ability to achieve and progress in life and enjoyment an ability to experience enjoyment and pleasure This instrument was included as there has been wide recognition of the limitations of EQ D and other health related QoL measures in the context of mental health conditions The capability approach is concerned with the evaluation of a person s ability to achieve functionings in life that are important to them Such functionings can range from basic considerations such as being nourished to more complex aspects such as self respect Overall the capability approach attempts to capture a more comprehensive picture of individuals when evaluating programmes or services rather than just limiting the space to health alone Changes to protocol We had originally planned to undertake a cost effectiveness analysis of different SARC models based on organisational structure in terms of the primary clinical outcome which was reduction in trauma symptoms PTSD based PCL However our analysis of the clinical outcome data demonstrated that significant clinical differences in terms of SARC organisational structures were not evident see Chapter It was therefore judged appropriate to conduct a full economic evaluation in the form of a cost utility analysis only focusing on cost per QALY gained The data are initially presented as a descriptive analysis of costs and outcomes in the form of an extended cost consequence analysis followed by a full economic evaluation in the form of a cost utility analysis This allows assessment of service use and costs for participants It was originally planned to develop a decision analytic model to evaluate the longer term impacts of the different types of service delivery on costs and outcomes However this was not judged to be appropriate based on the results of the cohort study which did not indicate meaningful clinical differences based on SARC organisational structures Base case analysis To compare the costs and benefits of different SARC service delivery models a within study analysis was undertaken A descriptive analysis of the service use and costs associated with different SARC models was undertaken as the first step a cost consequence analysis This involved analysing the service pathways followed by those accessing services We assessed costs and outcomes in a disaggregated manner for SARC pathways to provide information on the costs and outcomes associated with each NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No model The main analysis was based on the reported health related QoL examining changes at and months The secondary analysis examined changes in capability As shown in the previous chapter analyses of clinical outcomes demonstrated that there were no significant differences in terms of the primary clinical outcome which was a reduction in trauma symptoms PTSD based PCL based on SARC type Hence a cost effectiveness analysis based on the primary clinical outcome for the study was not deemed appropriate A full economic evaluation in terms of a cost utility analysis was performed to compare the cost per QALY gained at months for different SARC types Following an assessment of the level of missing data a complete case analysis was undertaken for the cost utility analysis and only participants who returned the resource use and EQ D question elements at all time points were included in the analysis It was not possible to employ multiple imputation methods because of the extent of missing data and a complete case analysis needed to be undertaken to explore changes in resource use and costs over time A similar approach as that outlined in Chapter was adopted to analyse differences in characteristics between participants at baseline Sensitivity analyses A series of one way deterministic sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the impact of the assumptions and estimated values included in the base case analysis Uncertainties around costs and outcomes were analysed and plausible ranges were specified using information from the study and from the literature To account for uncertainty due to sampling a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken involving a non parametric bootstrapping approach applied to derive paired estimates of mean differences in costs and utility values The paired estimates were presented on scatterplots for the cost utility analysis on the cost effectiveness planes STATA StataCorp LP College Station Tx USA version was used to perform the analyses Results Overall participants were recruited at baseline Baseline interviews were conducted nearly days after participants had accessed SARCs Overall participants completed the NHS resource use questions at baseline Data on NHS resource use at all time points baseline and months were obtained from only participants see Table In total participants completed the EQ D L questionnaire at baseline dropping to participants by months see Table Complete EQ D data at all time points were obtainable for only participants Health outcomes The analysis of the primary clinical outcome showed that there was no statistically significant difference based on SARC model type in terms of a clinically significant reduction in PTSD symptoms see Chapter Hence this section focuses on describing the data on health related QoL HRQoL collected during the study The mean EQ D value at baseline was similar across all SARC types at baseline and improved over the and month periods although remaining below population norms see Table The analysis of mean QALY gain over the month period was slightly higher for participants in police led SARCs but there was no statistically significant difference between the SARC models in terms of QALY gain see Table The results for the ICECAP A

followed by sexual health centre visits A high proportion of the contacts related to mental health services and when the range of mental health services are combined the rate of access was similar to primary care Service use after the initial SARC visit was similar across the different models of SARCs Overall reported use of NHS services had decreased at months Once again reported service usage mainly related to GP services with continued access of mental health services NHS service use further decreased by months The examination of costs associated with NHS service access across all time points showed that costs were similar across models complete case analysis see Table Third sector and broader public sector costs Reported resource use for other public sector services is detailed below A wide range of services were accessed by participants at all time points with reported levels of use decreasing over time For policing and criminal justice services contacts with police

with reported use decreasing over the time points Cost utility analysis The results of the cost utility analysis are presented in Table The police led model resulted in slightly more QALYs but was slightly more costly than the NHS led model However the differences in costs and outcomes were not statistically significant level As a secondary analysis broader societal costs were explored see Report Supplementary Material This assessed costs incurred by participants and their families Impacts on participants and their families were substantial For example respondents reported important effects on their employment and productivity Sensitivity analysis For details of the deterministic sensitivity analysis see Report Supplementary Material For the probabilistic sensitivity analysis the results of bootstrap replications were plotted on a cost effectiveness plane for the cost utility analysis see Figure and Report Supplementary Material This analysis suggested that there was uncertainty around the differences in costs and outcomes between the SARC models as replicates were distributed almost equally across all quadrants in terms of both effectiveness and cost Accordingly there is uncertainty around whether different SARC models are more or less costly than the alternative models and whether they are more or less effective Discussion Summary of main findings The data collected in the study suggested that participants accessed a wide range of healthcare services and other public sector services in the period between attending SARCs and joining the study but over time service use decreased The analyses undertaken suggested that the QALY gain and costs between SARC models were similar The cost effectiveness plane constructed to incorporate uncertainty around each point estimate in the results shows that there is considerable uncertainty around any estimated differences in costs and outcomes This is similar to the findings presented in Chapter which suggested that there was little evidence to suggest a relationship between PTSD as measured by the PCL and the SARC type However this study has only focused on those who have accessed SARCs The lack of a comparator arm means that it is not possible to assess how resource use and QALY gains compare for survivors who did not access such services Those who experience rape or sexual assault have a

that there were also substantial economic impacts on participants and their families e g time off work The results of this analysis suggested that access to services and costs were similar across SARC models Participants reported improvements in HRQoL over the month period under consideration although this remained below population norms The absence of a comparator arm means that it is not possible to compare HRQoL for those accessing SARCs with those who did not access SARC services Although the research base is limited there is evidence to suggest that a high proportion of those who develop PTSD are likely to face long term impacts on HRQoL Strengths and limitations This is the first analysis of health outcomes and resource use for those accessing SARCs in England Detailed data on resource use and health outcomes were collected The analysis also considered the broader costs for participants and their families associated with experience of sexual violence Given the limited literature focusing on the economic evaluation of services and programmes to address sexual violence and abuse the study provides useful data to inform decision making in this area The main limitation of the analysis was the level of missing data on resource use and QoL at all time points Accordingly multiple imputation methods could not be employed because of the extent of missing data and a complete case analysis needed to be undertaken Excluding those who did not complete the resource use questionnaire at all timepoints may have introduced bias and some level of inefficiency The bias may be based on the finding that certain groups including more disadvantaged groups were more likely to be lost to follow up Furthermore among those who were retained the resource use section of the interview was the section more often omitted by field workers in situations where the person reported lacking time or that the interview was too difficult for them to complete In this sense the study may have underestimated service use Caution is also needed in interpreting the level of service use at baseline while it covers a period of approximately months median was days there was a high variability in the timeframe between SARC access and the baseline interview Another limitation was that the follow up was only for months which may not have allowed longer term impacts to be fully captured Recommendations for research The data collected in the study suggested that participants needed to access a wide range of healthcare third sector and other public sector services There is a gap in understanding about the extent to which SARC service users access voluntary sector care and support in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse The study reports on important aspects of resource use in the voluntary sector for SARC service users specifically charity led SARC services and voluntary sector provided ISVAs However a full analysis of the voluntary sector resource use by SARC service users e g helplines support groups counselling advocacy services domestic violence services was beyond the scope of the current research This is a gap our research will fill in future analyses There is a need for greater understanding of the costs and outcomes for SARC users compared with those who do not access SARC services which was not possible in this study It is also important to assess the longer term service use and Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for

young people s experiences of sexual assault referral centres and recovery journeys Background It is estimated that at least of girls and young women and of boys and young men in England and Wales are sexually abused before the age of years It is likely that far more children are sexually abused when compared with the number of cases that are identified by official agencies The little research that has explored access to SARCs by CYP has predominantly reported trends in data such as the referral sources and per cent reported across regions in England or the impact of the nature of the abuse In CYP accessed a SARC in England and Wales most were girls and young women and only were from black Asian mixed or other non white ethnic backgrounds which is far below the proportion of children from these backgrounds in state schools and nurseries and supported by local authority children s services due to sexual abuse Over the years for which data have been available SARCs under reach to children from minority ethnic backgrounds has remained consistent During the police constituted two thirds of referrals of CYP to SARC followed by from local authority children s services All other referrals from health education or voluntary sector accounted for only each Self referrals or referrals from family and friends accounted for and another of referrals came from other sources There is very limited empirical research that explores the role of SARCs in CYP s recovery from sexual violence and abuse To date only one prospective cohort study has explored the mental and sexual health outcomes of year olds who attended SARC in a year period This study observed that the presence of a psychiatric morbidity months post SARC attendance was associated with baseline psychosocial vulnerability defined as previous social services involvement mental health service use self harm or sexual abuse but not assault characteristics Khadr et al recommended that CYP require comprehensive support to address high levels of pre existing vulnerability and psychological comorbidity and to prevent re victimisation In our Qualitative Evidence Synthesis see Chapter no studies specifically focused on children s experiences of SARC However a small number have explored experiences of therapeutic services and interactions with professionals outside of the SARC context Notably The Making Noise Project explored CYP s experiences of support among those who experienced sexual abuse in the family environment Of children reported that they attended a SARC however there were limited details about their experiences with SARCs In light of the limited evidence base about the role of SARCs in CYP s recovery from sexual violence and abuse this was to the best of our knowledge the first qualitative study to explore CYP s experiences of SARCs and their recovery after SARC Methods Study design overview We conducted semi structured interviews with CYP about their experiences of attending a SARC and what their recovery looked like afterwards Qualitative inquiry was important to enable CYP to articulate Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under

CENTRES their own experiences A focused approach to study recruitment was used see below recruiting CYP who attended one of two paediatric SARCs in two geographical regions in England These were sites where the team had built relationships to work closely with three linked third sector organisations ensuring that CYP were supported before during and after the study Changes to protocol The intended sample size of as proposed in Protocol V was not fulfilled Challenges to recruitment are discussed later in this chapter Theoretical approach Our theoretical approach was underpinned by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child whereby all children have the right to make their voices heard in matters that concern them while having the right to protection from harm and exploitation We recognised the importance of ensuring that the research did not lead to children experiencing further harm in light of the potentially long term and wide ranging detrimental impacts of experiencing sexual abuse during childhood while not wanting to exclude CYP from the research opportunity The approach was also informed by theoretical developments in the sociology of childhood viewing children as those able to make meaningful contributions towards issues that affect them rather than being objects of enquiry thus researching with children as has been acknowledged in inter related fields This study was underpinned by Critical Realism acknowledging that individuals or societies socially construct independent worlds and there are different yet valid perspectives about reality Critical Realism recognises that there is an independent reality as well as a subjective interpretation of it which is influenced by individuals interpretation of this reality at individual and social levels Sampling and recruitment Recruitment relied on SARCs and third sector organisations identifying eligible participants and connecting them to the research team When appropriate the professional introduced the study to the CYP and provided the leaflet participant information sheet PIS and directed them to the recruitment video With the consent of CYP interested in participating and the parents of those aged years contact details were securely shared with the research team who contacted CYP to discuss the study further Those who agreed to participate and the parents of those aged years provided informed consent Eligible individuals were years old in person SARC service users between August and December CYP were not approached if the assault occurred month ago and or if in exercising clinical judgement the professional at SARC or third sector agency anticipated the CYP might encounter difficulties in providing informed consent or understanding the interview content due to mental or physical health issues cognitive impairment learning disability or poor English language skills CYP were not approached if they were known to be in an unstable or unsafe situation We were prepared to overcome barriers to participation for example through the use of interpreters It was discussed with third sector organisations that it might be appropriate for them to provide additional support to CYP as someone who was present in the research interview if the CYP requested or being available for a debrief or follow up support afterwards Two SARCs and three third sector organisations passed on details for CYP and we enrolled The first CYP research interview occurred on August and the final interview was conducted on January Of the we did not enrol some no longer wished to participate n some arranged the interviews but later changed their minds n and we received no responses or communication from others n Recruitment challenges and strategies The study initiation was delayed due to COVID As the SARCs were NHS based NHS studies that were not yet live or not primarily focused on COVID were not allowed to progress Furthermore the third sector organisations initially had no capacity to assist due to the impacts of COVID pandemic on their services Once the SARCs and third sector organisations had capacity the research team conducted training sessions to equip sites in their understanding of participant eligibility The research NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No team worked with organisations to identify strategies and appropriate times for them to facilitate conversations about the research with CYP There were occasions when SARCs and third sector organisations regularly shared contact details however there were often periods when this was less frequent This meant that recruitment was slow as there was a small pool of individuals from which we could approach at any given point in time Some CYP were quickly enrolled into the study while it took longer to enrol others Recruitment challenges also related to the service landscape of third sector services While one organisation experienced major staffing shortages exacerbated by COVID pandemic staff found it helpful to meet with the research team every weeks to discuss recruitment progress As another organisation had staff members join their team at various junctures we attended their team meetings at different time points to explain the research opportunity In the final year of recruitment a third sector organisation had capacity to assist enabling a wider pool of CYP to be approached Participants One boy cis gender participated along with adolescent girls cis gender At entry to the study three were aged years two were aged years and seven had just turned years At access to SARC seven were aged years and five were aged or years Ethnicities included White British n Indian British n Black British n and White British and Black Caribbean heritage n While no CYP was known to have a physical disability two were neurodiverse attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism diagnoses At the time of participating all CYP attended secondary school or th form college Eleven participants lived with non abusive parents and one lived independently All CYP were referred to SARC by the police and seven had a FME Some also received remote support from the SARC At the time of accessing SARC the time since the index offence took place varied among the sample days n between days and months n more than months n and over months n We spoke to CYP for months to years after they interacted with the SARC Information provided by SARC indicated that across our sample the index offences involved nine rapes and three sexual assaults and the perpetrator included a family member n peer n and someone in a position of authority n Criminal justice outcomes included one withdrawal due to the perpetrator being re interviewed eight cases were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service or police and three were under police investigation There were no recorded prosecutions in our sample Conversations with children and young people We conducted interviews that we referred to as conversations We were mindful about language as we did not want CYP to compare the research to a police interview as the research was not about them providing an account of the abuse experiences We also wanted dialogue that was accessible and comfortable By adopting qualitative participatory methods we wanted CYP to have the opportunity to articulate their experiences in their own voice CYP were encouraged to challenge misrepresentations clarify and interpret comments they and or others made thus increasing collaboration All CYP chose to engage in dialogue during the conversation and one young person additionally shared a drawing as she felt this better demonstrated aspects of her journey Conversations lasted for minutes mean minutes Analytical approach We adopted Braun and Clarke s Reflexive TA approach which can be used across a range of research questions sample sizes and data collection methods The approach complemented our Critical Realist perspective We used Braun and Clarke s six phases of TA familiarisation with the data coding generating initial themes developing and reviewing themes refining defining and naming themes and writing up Analysis was recursive enabling movement back and forth between phases Transcripts were coded by hand GC and FL who were involved in speaking with CYP remained reflexive throughout the research considering how preconceptions values and beliefs impacted how the study Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O

organisations statutory health education and CJS impacted their recovery We firstly present key findings that were specific to CYP s experiences of SARC followed by key themes related to CYP s recovery journeys overall Children and young people s experiences of SARCs Children and young people had positive experiences at SARC acknowledging its key role in enabling holistic care through conducting FMEs providing medical care that provided reassurance and offering referrals to organisations for further support Many CYP told us that they did not have prior awareness of what a SARC was until they disclosed to a trusted individual and reported to the police One young person had prior awareness through social media where they had learned of others experiences of what SARCs were like I had heard of it before I got most of the information actually from Tik Tok where others were all telling their own stories but both good and bad I would say my experience is better than a lot of the ones I d heard of Serenity Children and young people reported that although they had been anxious when they first attended the SARC the staff made them feel comfortable and welcomed At the start I felt a bit nervous I didn t obviously know what was going on properly I didn t really want everyone to look at me but then by the end I felt a bit more comfortable Ben Children and young people appreciated SARC staff communicating clearly to them before and throughout the FME They explained it very well what was going to happen like the whole swabs and how it s going to work She said to me It s not going to hurt but you might feel a little bit uncomfortable Aurora I had a full body examination done for bruises and marks I had a couple of STD tests I had another internal examination for bruising on the cervix They d show me what they were using and they let me know every step of the way what they were doing Serenity Children and young people valued having opportunities to make decisions during the FME They gave me the option for the support worker to stay in the room as well like behind the curtain to talk to you to distract you so that was really good that helped Somaya The SARCs in our study were based in hospitals and the CYP had mixed opinions about how suitable this was Some appreciated the hospital environment as it provided a sense of anonymity Others thought it felt clinical and could have been more welcoming NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No When I kind of turned up to the SARC it made me nervous because it just gave me hospital prison vibes I think I would give it more kind of homely I know obviously they have to be like professional and medical but I don t know if there was something more kind of welcoming Lola Children and young people highlighted the importance of being able to take literature from SARC home that they could read when they felt in a better place to engage with it They also valued receiving a care pack It s like a massive relief the way they told me that I can go home with this really good quality stuff And I could relax myself I could clean myself Serenity The service provision landscape after SARCs Children and young people believed their recovery was impacted by the service landscape in which support services were provided post SARC this led to many experiencing continued poor mental health and further trauma symptoms Long waiting lists for counselling delayed CYP accessing support Some suggested that time spent on waiting lists could be better managed by services so that their mental health did not worsen One CYP has been presented as an example of this There was this lady that would call me once a month when I was on the waiting list That happened or times and she sent me workbooks They had lots of quotes powerful messages and activities to do like naming things you ve achieved since what happened to you getting you to think about positives I found them helpful Lola Some CYP described how they accessed support through digital apps which they engaged with at their own pace particularly while waiting for counselling CYP often found these apps themselves and thought they could help them manage physical and mental health impacts associated with their trauma For some long waiting lists for counselling from third sector organisations led to them starting counselling provided by their school However this still had its limitations I think they said that it would be a long wait I think it was like a year and a half However the school gave me counselling but they couldn t be very helpful because I was in my last year and I didn t know the counsellor and I didn t even do that for long because I was in the last year of school Somaya Those who had positive experiences of support often felt that its duration was too short This was particularly difficult when CYP had developed positive relationships with those supporting them CYP felt frustrated about being unable to share details about the abuse with their therapist when their case was going through the CJS Thus long waiting lists short term support and criminal justice guidance impacted their health and well being Children and young people felt that there should be considerable financial investment into services to educate people about sexual abuse and support those who had experienced it I think there needs to be more funding put into recovery groups for people who have been through this kind of thing People who have been through this kind of thing need a way to rebuild their identity and give them that sense of community More projects that work around the stigma of boys who have been sexually assaulted Projects to educate people and then projects to help rebuild people and their self esteem after this has happened Clara Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a

Organisations and systems working together Children and young people emphasised the importance of professionals working well together within and between organisations at SARC and post SARC as this had implications on the support and care they received The staff seemed to work well as a team They understood each other and the comfortableness I felt or I could see with them was put onto me I felt like I could very much trust them They were very patient with me They really understood how it was for me Serenity One young person explained how a staff member in school worked with a third sector organisation to ensure she had a safe space to engage in virtual therapy sessions during school hours Working together in this way enabled her to receive support seamlessly CYP highlighted the importance of joint working within education settings particularly when the topic of sexual violence and abuse was part of the school curriculum The well being officer was messaging my teachers for me she was like Oh she s feeling a bit like this today maybe not do this or maybe not pick on her as much in class like don t get her to put her hand up all the time She helped me to work with my teachers especially as I do health and social and we had to learn about sexual abuse Yolanda Many described the critical role of their ChISVA who provided them with updates and explained criminal justice processes because of their good relationships with other organisations such as the police CYP felt that their ChISVA fulfilled their role as their advocate However CYP told us how there were missed opportunities for support even when professionals tried to work with other agencies I remember there was one time I was with my detective She casually said in conversation Oh you should tell your social worker this this and this and I was just like What social worker And she was like When I set up your case I arranged for a social worker to be in contact with you You should have had one from the start I was like this whole time she thought I had a social worker because she had said to them You need to go do this And nothing ever happened Clara Children and young people emphasised the importance of inter agency communication by professionals following a disclosure of sexual abuse Aurora shared how her teacher responded by following safeguarding processes but it was not communicated how quickly her parents and the police would be notified Obviously knowing about the whole sexual assault she teacher couldn t keep it to herself And I think that she had to call safeguarding and obviously safeguarding had to call the police and then she called my mum about it I knew that she would have to tell someone because obviously I m under But I didn t realise it was going to be like super super quick Aurora Children and young people valued healthcare professionals working together so they did not have to explain their experience of assault multiple times Somaya shared how the SARC communicated with her GP but as the GP did not acknowledge her sexual abuse when prescribing her medication this led to her feeling as though the GP was not concerned with her overall health NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No SARC had told my GP It says on like my history or something now They just kind of without questions sort of prescribed the medication Like they could have asked me and gave me the option and like tried to check my overall health or tried to like support before prescribing I don t know like if they maybe like cared about my overall health rather than just being like Oh this is for you Somaya Children and young people expected professionals to work together to help them build their support system by signposting them to other local services ranging from housing to sexual health However CYP and their parents sometimes found it overwhelming and confusing when many services contacted them at once Thus CYP recommended a more joined up approach between organisations Principles underpinning a trauma informed approach Children and young people s healing was influenced primarily by their experience of interacting with professionals CYP provided examples of positive interactions and ones that felt damaging CYP described the following principles that can be seen to be promoted in trauma informed approaches to supporting survivors Feeling empowered through having choice and control Feeling empowered through having choice and control was important to CYP as the abuse had taken this away from them This involved professionals making them aware of opportunities where they could make decisions One CYP appreciated making decisions about how they made contact with their ChISVA For example if their ChISVA sent them a text message they could decide when to reply without feeling pressured to respond immediately CYP also reported that having options about how they could engage with services face to face or remotely enabled greater accessibility Within therapeutic settings CYP valued flexibility and options in how they communicated their feelings often in creative ways which could also be used as a tool outside of the therapy room I think it s sometimes when you can t find the right words for something sometimes just like an image can show that and portray that rather than describing it in detail Lola As part of feeling empowered CYP valued clear communication particularly while navigating the CJS A lack of communication often led to CYP feeling as though they were not valued There would be like months where I wouldn t hear anything which is obviously very natural But there would be things going on behind the scenes and I don t think sometimes that information was passed on soon enough Cece Not being judged or blamed Children and young people valued interactions where they did not feel judged or blamed for the abuse This was conveyed through what professionals said and how they communicated Just being able to know that you can go to someone with your problems and your feelings and just know that you re not gonna be judged for it and they re here to help you Bel Children and young people described examples within criminal justice processes where language came across as blaming or judging them A lot of the letter I felt was blaming it on me Basically at one point they just said there just wasn t enough evidence and I was happy with that But then they went on to sort of blame me and was like You could ve They went on to say like You didn t Basically I didn t seem upset enough Sophie Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for

Journals Library and the DOI of the publication must be cited CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE S ExPERIENCES OF SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES Children and young people explained how interactions with professionals could be confusing because the tone and approach could vary depending on the purpose of the interaction I would have liked a bit more warning that the police interview wouldn t be the same as the small talks at home It was the same guy that came round to my house that did the interview and he was completely different and it was really formal They were acting like I was lying because of how they were asking stuff But then he came round again to our house and he was lovely again and he was like we wanted to let you know that we believe you It was all fine but obviously in that moment it was so different Lola Being treated as a whole person Children and young people emphasised the importance of being treated as a whole individual particularly by those providing therapeutic support While they wanted to be understood for what they had experienced they did not want to be defined by the abuse It was important that their resilience and strength was acknowledged even when they were struggling You get the vibe that she sees the whole person like she sees everything that I ve been through actually the good the bad the lows the highs So she knows I m not just a negative person but actually when I m struggling and when I m not Sophie Children and young people valued services treating them as a whole person through the way in which they promoted CYP s actual and felt safety such as providing them with taxis to access the service Ideal characteristics or qualities of professionals Children and young people identified key qualities that they believed professionals should have all stemming from the principles identified by CYP which could be described as trauma informed While CYP felt that professionals could be trained in these they recognised these could be inherent qualities within a person which should be considered when recruiting professionals into job roles Empathy Children and young people said that professionals should listen and show empathy not just in their words but through their body language CYP felt they could distinguish between those who showed authentic compassion and those who did not Experiencing genuine empathy and compassion had a long lasting impact for CYP It s like everything from the tone of voice to the body language to the actual words that are spoken You really just have to show it It s those people skills It felt comfortable and friendly whilst also giving that professional level of support She s one of the biggest impacts on my life I will never forget her Clara However there were damaging implications on health and decisions about pursuing justice when empathy was not conveyed The way they would like look at me sometimes or the way they word it it made me feel like is this really all worth it Just simple things like looks and phrases lack of communication it twists the mind Especially after these events you overthink a lot and it s dangerous for some people Serenity Providing a personalised response While CYP recognised that professionals had high caseloads they believed this should not compromise genuine engagement with individuals and building trust This required professionals to be organised invest in meaningful relationships with CYP and work with other professionals who had more NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No established relationships with CYP CYP felt this would lead to providing personalised support bespoke to the individual It doesn t feel like you re just talking to a textbook It s not generic it s not full of buzzwords It s personal My ChISVA didn t sound like a talking textbook she sounded like a real person and it felt like I was talking to a friend Clara Children and young people valued professionals tailoring support and being creative in their communication particularly if they had a disability When support was not tailored this negatively affected their engagement with the support With my autism I need specific questions to answer because I didn t really know how to explain my feelings and she would just sit there in silence for ages at a time It was really awkward I could never get anything out I never felt welcome there It just never helped Serenity As part of this CYP felt that the type of therapeutic support available to them through services should be varied recognising that some therapy types might suit some people more than others and this would facilitate engagement in therapy Knowledge and expertise Children and young people believed that as part of providing a personalised response professionals should be trained in understanding the nature of sexual abuse and its impacts and were aware of factors that could impact healing such as difficult relationships at home the level of ongoing contact they had with the perpetrator or experiencing domestic abuse CYP valued reassurance about professionals level of understanding Some described the negative impact of professionals or systems not consistently showing awareness of the wider context in which abuse occurs particularly in relation to the CJS This system isn t very inclusive It s not very accessible and a lot of ethnic minorities and young black girls are subject to sexual violence at a young age and you have people in the system who don t understand those backgrounds don t understand the sociology behind them and how they ended up being the victims of what they were I think it s just leading to a lack of justice being provided There s not an understanding of the lives of the people that are involved Clara Children and young people felt it was critical that healthcare professionals particularly had general training about sexual violence and abuse when working with any young person even if they were not aware that they had experienced sexual violence and abuse This was important in the context of conducting general medical consultations and examinations Others felt that professionals did not always fully appreciate the devastating effects of all forms of abuse which led to its minimisation CYP recommended the importance of professionals receiving specific training Calm and resilient Children and young people often remarked that professionals should be calm and resilient while recognising that professionals needed support to hold others trauma CYP reported that the calm and resilient nature of professionals could also be influenced by the physical environment in which they provided support which could be beneficial particularly if young people were accessing support from challenging home environments Just have a calm environment where it grows onto them Because it s the worst when you re feeling like

impacted their lives and how their experiences of accessing support helped to improve these effects Factors such as being unable to access support or re victimisation exacerbated these effects One important outcome was CYP gaining understanding of sexual violence and abuse and how it affected them knowing it was not their fault and they were not to blame By receiving appropriate support CYP found it beneficial to recognise and confront what happened to them When your family blame you your school blame you it feels like it is your fault but then when somebody finally goes it wasn t your fault what happened you kind of feel at peace with yourself Ashleigh This led to CYP experiencing improvements in their physical and mental health their education interpersonal relationships and being able to re engage in a wide range of areas in their lives CYP valued being provided with tools and techniques they could use once formal support ended I think the support has made me more capable of looking after myself I can notice more in myself I can identify my emotions and the real reasons behind them I think I m more calm Before I would have outbursts a lot and I d get really angry quite quickly Yolanda Recovery is ongoing Children and young people explained how their healing was ongoing and this was not the same for everyone CYP recognised that there were time points when they felt ready to start receiving support and times where they did not Some felt tensions between not feeling ready to engage with support while being afraid that support may no longer be available if they did not take it up Although CYP knew their rights to access support at another point some felt unable to ask for that support again if they had previously refused it CYP also highlighted the significance of being prepared for formal support to end and having a sense of closure as part of their recovery We really got on and then it sort of feels a bit like a break up that you re never gonna see her But then when she sent the letter that was nice because it sort of put it all together like how much we d done and accomplished Lola Motivation to make changes for others Children and young people s experiences of SARC and support post SARC motivated them to engage with opportunities where they could be heard Some support services provided CYP opportunities to participate in a consultation group once formal support ended where they could influence service delivery This enabled CYP to remain connected with services and make changes for others Children and young people told us that they felt motivated to participate in our research study for a number of reasons Because of CYP s positive experiences with services they wanted to ensure that others received positive support I feel like my motivation has just been to help others When it happened I was in a very down place and I m now a much happier more creative just independent person now I want people to know that it s not gonna be like horrible for the rest of their lives Polly For others negative experiences of support or areas where they felt could have been improved fuelled their motivation to ensure changes were made for CYP in the future NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No I hate the thought of someone I know to go through this and have the same experience where actually one small change would have made the broader difference I m keen to give my opinion because I wish things were different for me in some areas Sophie I know that I will be at least making some difference and I m giving my time my thoughts and my energy to this research I want to campaign for change My own experiences of the criminal justice system made me passionate about helping people Clara Discussion Summary of main findings This study is the first of its kind to explore CYP s experiences of SARCs and their journeys post SARC Our findings demonstrated the uniqueness of recovery in this group of survivors Recovery was influenced by how quickly CYP accessed support its content and duration the location and context of care and how well services worked together Healing was also affected by life events that CYP experienced which included sexual re victimisation Re exposure to abuse served to aggravate trauma symptoms and undermine engagement with services Children and young people had positive experiences of SARCs and valued their role in offering them a FME and connecting them with onward support services As the majority of CYP in the study did not have prior knowledge of SARC this raises questions about SARC awareness among younger populations and the importance of professionals awareness of SARCs when responding to disclosures of sexual violence and abuse Among the majority of those we spoke to SARCs played a role in responding to recent sexual offences which relied on CYP disclosing abuse In light of the costs to the NHS of delayed disclosures of sexual violence in childhood and lifelong impacts for survivors it is paramount that professionals are prepared to recognise and manage disclosures effectively Children and young people felt that their recovery was impacted by the limitations associated with the broader service provision landscape of services accessed post SARC Accessing delayed and short term support was the norm There continues to be an urgent need to invest in resources for services to minimise the negative health and well being impacts for young survivors that are exacerbated by not receiving timely and long term support Our findings support other research that has shown young survivors managing their own mental health and well being while waiting for support While adequate resourcing of services may take time CYP in the study suggested that there were benefits of services managing waiting list times such as providing psychoeducation Children and young people identified principles that were key to their recovery which could be described as principles underlining a trauma informed response to supporting survivors Recovery outcomes not only were dependent on timely support but were also impacted by CYP s interactions with professionals at SARCs and across sectors including specialist sexual violence services statutory health education social services and the CJS Thus trauma informed principles and certain qualities associated with professionals such as showing empathy and compassion not judging CYP providing a personalised response and empowering CYP all play a role in CYP achieving long term gains in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse These principles and qualities reinforce key messages from our qualitative evidence synthesis see Chapter about what factors impacted survivors engagement with interventions and recovery outcomes Notably the lack of a trauma informed approach was associated with poor or delayed healing Therefore early intervention and a consistent trauma informed approach across professionals could prevent long term negative health and well being impacts for young survivors Further exploration is needed to distil what trauma informed practice looks like across sectors that are specialist SAAS Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of

NHS services and how professionals can be trained This supports observations that demonstrate that adult survivors contact with support services alone does not reduce trauma symptoms rather it is the quality of services and survivors assessments of their interactions with professionals that appear relevant in promoting recovery The study also observed that when the opportunity is provided CYP valued being part of informing and developing services to help others For some this aspect played a key role in their recovery journey As noted by Bovarnick et al choosing appropriate levels of participation for CYP s engagement is important going forward carefully considering how opportunities will empower CYP whose needs their involvement serves and whether participation can be enacted ethically and meaningfully Strengths and limitations This study provided detailed and novel insights into how SARCs and onward services impacted CYP s recovery However it replicated some of the problems of access to services with the voices of young participants from black communities and diverse cultural communities of individuals with physical disabilities and of boys and young men largely missing in this study There were also limitations in representing SARC services with only two paediatric services involved We hope that reflections and learnings from our qualitative study of diverse adult survivors see Chapter can speak to some of the risk and access issues affecting members of subpopulations missed in the current study Implications for health care It is paramount that a trauma informed approach is adopted across universal and specialist settings as professionals may unknowingly interact with individuals who have experienced sexual violence and abuse Therefore attention should be provided to equipping professionals through training As delays to receiving support can negatively impact CYP s health and well being urgent investment is needed to resource services adequately In addition services should consider ways to manage opportunities while CYP are on waiting lists for therapeutic support which could be beneficial to their recovery There is also a need for greater education about the role of SARCs and onward support services among any professional a young survivor may interact with to build CYP s support network Recommendations for research Involving groups that have been under represented at SARCs is vital to gain increased understand ing about barriers to accessing support and how services can be tailored to better meet needs Further research needs to distil what trauma informed practice means in different sectors and identify barriers to its implementation The voices of CYP should be part of informing research studies throughout their lifecycle and in the development of services These opportunities should be safe and trauma informed spaces NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Chapter Access to sexual assault referral centres among racially minoritised and other disadvantaged survivors Background People with minority characteristics may be more likely to experience sexual violence and abuse than other members of the general population For example a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC survey conducted in the USA found that lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to be victims of rape physical violence and or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime than heterosexual women Similarly in a study of minority stress by Lefevor et al non binary gender individuals were harassed sexually abused and subjected to traumatic events at higher rates than either cis gender or binary transgender people approximately half of non binary individuals reported one of these experiences Other population characteristics that may interact with risk for sexual violence and abuse include mental health disabilities and socioeconomic deprivation There is a high prevalence of recent sexual and domestic violence in those with severe mental health problems Studies have also highlighted the risks faced by neurodiverse people and those with learning disability Despite the potential for higher rates of victimisation in some groups evidence suggests that they may be under represented among those seeking support for sexual violence and abuse Men people who identify as LGBTQ people from ethnic minority backgrounds people involved in sex work and older adults are often under represented among those accessing SAAS including SARCs relative to estimates of abuse in different sub populations As many as in men are known to have experienced sexual assault since the age of years but may experience gendered barriers to getting help While an audit of service users at St Mary s SARC in Manchester UK showed over representation of black and dual heritage service users individuals from other ethnic minorities especially those from Asian backgrounds were under represented Given this under representation of minority groups within SAAS and SARCs relative to the risk some of these groups face there is a need to better understand some of the barriers they may face in accessing support Barriers are likely to include fears about encountering homophobia transphobia racism or other forms of discrimination from those who provide services and shame or guilt associated with help seeking and minority stress There is also a need to understand the recovery journeys of people with different types of characteristics so that support services can draw on this understanding of what different types of people may find helpful and be as inclusive and welcoming as possible to anyone who has experienced rape sexual assault or sexual abuse This chapter therefore sets out the methods and findings from a qualitative investigation of the experiences and recovery journeys including barriers and facilitators to service access of members of the MESARCH cohort as well as people recruited from outside of SARC services Methods Study design overview This qualitative study was embedded within the wider cohort study presented in Chapter and involved interviews with individuals who had and had not accessed SARCs following exposure to sexual violence and abuse at some point in their lives It employs a story telling approach to gather data with participants and applies narrative analysis This chapter is underpinned by narrative constructionism this is an interpretive and socio cultural approach that positions those

narratives are seen to have been passed down and co constructed through participants social and cultural worlds This chapter sets out to explore people s actions and efforts to help themselves in relation to the occurrence of abuse and violence and the impacts on their lives in particular where individuals hold identities associated with marginalisation or minoritisation This could relate to identifying as a member of a minority cultural or ethnic group identifying as transgender having chronic or long term mental health problems involved in sex work through coercion or choice or being homeless Thus approaching narratives as the cultural and social resources available to participants and upon which they construct the big and small tales of their lives and experiences of trauma and abuse and help seeking is viewed as an appropriate orientation for this work We acknowledge that without clear explanation terms such as story tale and story telling which are central to narrative methods could be unhelpful even harmful in this context Indeed ontological relativism the basis for viewing knowledge in this study conceptualises psychosocial phenomena as multiple and created This may seem at odds with survivors expressed need for being believed and a positivist stance that a single truth related to individuals victimisation exists Our research takes the position that all participants are believed with full understanding of the role of being believed in survivors healing and recovery People s stories are not constructed within a vacuum this form of narrative enquiry enables the participant to share their experiences in the order of importance that matters most to them This also enables the researcher to look at the whole person and not just that part of a person s life that is under investigation We also believed narrative enquiry would minimise reductionism and draw attention to power dynamics related to gender sexuality race and socioeconomic status operating in everyday life that may affect help seeking For us storytelling is used as a way to gather powerful accounts and authentic voices that centre the survivor as the story teller and the researchers and MESARCH LEG member or experts by experience as story analysts Use of the constructionist approach enables the study to advance one of its key aims to access the critical personal socio cultural and political narratives about people s capacities to keep themselves safe and seek help e g from SARCs in the aftermath of exposure to trauma and abuse as well as those narratives that influence their recovery journeys while conferring anonymity and contributing to future forming research Changes to protocol The study was unable to recruit in the community to the projected target of Group culturally and linguistically diverse people who had never accessed SARCs due to the particular barriers of stigma silencing and abuse faced by marginalised individuals and groups We engaged with eight willing community based organisations these agencies reflected on the difficulties in engaging with their target communities and how they run outreach programmes using workshops about confidence building and group activities for many months before issues related to safety and abuse can be raised Despite the challenges the MESARCH cohort study did recruit of survivors from a range of cultural ethnic or linguistic backgrounds therefore we focused our efforts to understand about barriers for these individuals expanding beyond our target number of Group We experienced no difficulties recruiting the planned participants for our third group Group were individuals in the cohort study with minority characteristics other than cultural or linguistic diversity e g LGBTQ identity people with a disability men older people Theoretical approach Reflecting the specific aims of this study intersectionality was employed as a theoretical framework for guiding design data collection and analysis It is a valuable lens for interpreting the experiences of people intentionally accounting for a relational web of factors that may help or hinder their safety access to helping resources and recovery This web of factors includes gender and sexual identities ethnicity socio economic status nationality and immigration and a range of other protected characteristics such as mental health age and disability Another important and linked theoretical underpinning is the potential for survivors to be marginalised or othered within their own NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No communities Survivors may be isolated for having poor mental health for example or discouraged from seeking help for their health concerns Similarly domestic and sexual violence and abuse may be seen as private family matters victims and survivors attempting to exit abusive relationships or seek help especially from outside of that community may be seen to bring shame on families communities Othering may also apply where minority populations are treated as them by institutions made up of us e g inadequate policing responses to a report of a rape by a gay man or by a non English speaking migrant woman Many people who participated in MESARCH would say in reference to the abuse and what occurred afterwards that they experienced events that had life changing consequences Narratives may serve to rebuild a person s shattered sense of identity and meaning and thus the research was also concerned with capturing these narratives Participants and settings All participants for this story telling and narrative analysis study were aged years at the time of their qualitative interview This part of the MESARCH project set out to engage three sub groups of survivors Survivors that had accessed a SARC and self identified as being from any cultural ethnic or linguistic minority community in England Group Survivors in the community who self identified as being from any cultural ethnic or linguistic minority community in England but had not accessed SARCs Group Survivors that had accessed SARCs and considered themselves to be from any other minority e g LGBTQ community or had a disability or held a characteristic that may lead to experiencing marginalisation or vulnerability in this context e g men survivors homeless individuals those with long term mental health problems such as psychosis or complex PTSD Group The SARC sample i e Groups and was drawn from the MESARCH cohort study using maximum variation sampling to represent a range of characteristics The setting of the MESARCH cohort study is described in Chapter Group consisted of people from minoritised groups who had not accessed SARCs and were likely to have experienced delayed help seeking This group was more difficult to recruit We relied on voluntary sector organisations that provide support after sexual assault rape or abuse and or those with community ethnic minorities outreach services aimed at engaging seldom heard populations Recruitment and consent See Chapter for a discussion of the ethical principles governing the MESARCH project Group and Group It was explained to all participants joining the cohort study that they may be approached following completion in the cohort study to participate in a further interview as part of our embedded qualitative study It was explained that this would employ an unstructured approach as distinct from the relatively structured cohort interviews to hearing about the person s views and experiences Participants were also reminded of this after the month cohort interview to provide people the opportunity decline further contact If people had actively withdrawn from the study see Chapter for flow of participants through the study then we did not reach out to them again Groups and were contacted initially by email or in line with their preferences for contact and provided with a PIS and a new consent form for the qualitative study Interviewees were offered a range of ways of engaging with the qualitative study and most chose a video meeting This had not been done for the cohort study all phone interviews and for those who had previously engaged with our research a video link provided an important opportunity for further rapport building with the research more broadly This led to several MESARCH participants attending the MESARCH conference see Chapter Before starting the interview the main pillars of consent were checked explaining

baseline until we had achieved a comprehensive mix of experiences Group To recruit Group we engaged with staff at eight charities voluntary sector agencies in London the West Midlands and East of England The staff members then approached their clients and services users inviting them to contact the researchers The MESARCH project operates an empowerment model of engagement with survivors and aimed to be trauma informed prioritising survivors perspectives needs and choices This was even more critical with Group For example we needed to recognise that survivors of abuse are not a homogeneous group and that some survivors face more oppression and silencing than others Relative to other survivors people eligible for our Group may be more isolated and socially and economically disempowered and at greater risk of negative responses e g disbelief racist and victim blaming attitudes threats by family or community in relation to disclosure and or their help seeking may be influenced by practices and attitudes that normalise violence against women and children We considered a wide range of ways of enabling safe and empowering participation for these survivors We minimised any references to sexual violence and abuse and used the features of story telling to enable participants to share as much or as little as they wished and to start and end the story of their help seeking journey wherever felt right for them Potential participants were provided the opportunity to have an interpreter and or a support worker present at the interview and or access to therapeutic or support sessions afterwards provided by the agency through which the participant was recruited Once contact was established we provided an information sheet and asked potential participants to complete the consenting process If needed this was verbally translated before the interview Interviews were offered through a range of modalities At the conclusion of the interview we gathered some basic sociodemographic information from Group participants matching the variables presented for Groups and see Findings below The conversation We generally referred to a conversation over an interview as the former may be experienced as less formal and daunting for participants An interview schedule was used to guide interviews adapted to each context and group as appropriate for example asking about SARC experiences in Groups and but minimising reference to specific service types in Group however overall a story telling approach was adopted The guide was carefully designed and pilot tested to minimise any potential distress for the participants Story telling and biographical narrative interviews are different from semi structured interviews Story telling is linked to broad narratives interested in exploring in depth lived experiences including contexts identities different stages of life and ways of sharing personal and collective experiences This encouraged survivors to tell the story of their help seeking journey We undertook hours of data collection with an average interview duration of range minutes At the conclusion of interviews we offered debriefing an honorarium of in the form of a shopping voucher and offered to cover any expenses incurred such a childcare All participants in this qualitative study consented to audio recording of interviews and these were transcribed verbatim before pseudonymisation and analysis see Chapter for handling of data Analysis Narrative analysis captures a range of methods that have in common their focus on stories Visual narrative analysis focus on how and when an image was created structural narrative analysis focus on how stories are told and linguistic features used and personal narrative analysis focus on evolving personal life biographies are all examples of types of narrative analysis We selected dialogical narrative analysis because it promotes examining what is told in the story its content and how a story is put together in terms of the narrative resources that are deployed Further dialogical narrative analysis considers what occurs as a result of telling the story its effects Smith refers to narrative as a practical NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No medium and the primary medium for action p making it consistent with the goal of many MESARCH participants After a history of assault I think I was more frustrated by it I just wanted to do something productive and so I contacted SARC about the project I feel the research is empowering me I don t feel the shame I used to feel about It s a heavy weight to hold on your own having this dialogue in a way that will help others is just very good and the wider project s goals for impact It is reasonable to blend narrative methods and in fact dialogical narrative analysis blends performative narrative analysis how the interviewer and interviewee perform a story together and why something is said in an interview with thematic narrative analysis what the content of stories is Story telling in combination with dialogical narrative analysis potentially achieves a range of functions that are consistent with intersectionality as a theoretical framework for interpreting the findings They allow us to approach and understand about the various ways in which survivors might experience oppression risk barriers and delayed care based on multiple and often minority identities Stages of the analysis We followed steps of dialogical narrative analysis set out by Smith We conducted indwell ing the notion of becoming familiar with the stories through multiple readings and also thinking of each participant as a person with a story to tell We identified the big stories those that take time to tell contain substantial detail and reflection over major life events or experiences and small stories the mini side stories that people tell in relation to everyday things within the transcripts Next we identified narrative themes or patterns running through individual stories by attending to what is repeated and significant for the story teller using colour coding for different themes and making notes in the margins Over coding was avoided as it tends to break down the text too much for narrative analysis to be effective Identifying the structure of the story or stories was about establishing how it was constructed It can be considered visually by plotting time and the trajectory of the story for example a story about moving through the criminal justice process may be depict ed as a positive curve e g getting closer to a trial date or a decline e g going from having high hopes about getting justice to a notification about the case being closed by the police with little explanation followed by the conclusion of support from the ISVA Smith also includes a series of guiding questions to extend the dialogical narrative analysis further for example identity questions How do people tell stories about who they were or who they may become and function questions How might this story or telling it be useful to the survivor Narrative analysis attends to the particular by looking at the data as a coherent whole To achieve this we created core stories for each participant in the embedded qualitative study critically maintaining the participant s own words throughout and removing extraneous material We moved fragments of themes together and integrated events into a temporally organised whole with a the matic thread The final step in our narrative analysis was for the four researchers and two Lived Experiences Group members to move from story analysts to story tellers through the co production of compos ites This involved the researchers reading and re reading the core stories and identifying and discussing common themes plots and threads across the core stories We examined these themes plots and threads for linkages with our research question as well as allowing these to emerge in ductively e g connections between cultural background and risk We clustered stories or themes within stories tacking together sections of participants stories and importantly retaining the soul of the narrative p Typologies of narratives arose from the study that communicate the central points about the oppression barriers gaps and opportunities discussed by participants we shared stories and created composites that emphasised temporality and captured common themes in survivor journeys of recovery and healing Given the wealth of data available our follow up on this research will share composites that convey what the telling of stories within the MESARCH project can do for survivors as

told of persecution over their sexuality from their family in their country of origin Main narrative findings The core stories developed with survivors shared many narrative plots and arcs central to addressing questions about barriers to access to SARCs other SAAS NHS care and justice related services We first present typologies of risk in relation to sexual violence and abuse three sub themes see Table these were not intentionally examined but were a pertinent feature of participants narratives intersecting in important ways with identities about mental health prior trauma cultural heritage and social disadvantage Second we present typologies that foreground the most significant and urgent access issues identified by our sample eight sub themes We also showcase aspects of best practice in enabling vulnerable and or minority community survivors access SARCs and other settings Finally typologies about recovery and healing are presented Twelve sub themes address what defines promotes and prevents recovery in this context The narrative study provided in depth data to complement findings from the process evaluation and the reporting of clinical outcomes in the cohort study Typology of narratives about risk As survivors recounted their experiences following sexual abuse a perpetual cycle of repeated exposures to increasingly severe and complex risky situations emerged In this typology each composite compiles how the cycle of risk manifested and what risks survivors described themselves experiencing through their journey thus far Gender based violence the curse of being a woman A large sub sample of our narratives were voices of individuals from a racial minority background As women reflected on their journey a core collection of stories emerged around the oppression of women due to historical patriarchal values and gendered double standards that were socio culturally reinforced A prominent theme across the narratives was forced marriages Within forced marriages women experienced a severe decline in both mental and physical health For some this also involved migrating to a new country but for most it was leaving one chaotic environment for another Women described as being bound living in a daily hell where they were raped beaten berated and in some cases physically abused by their in laws Throughout the narratives women transitioned from beliefs that were ego syntonic to ego dystonic Women described being conditioned from an early age about what it means to be a woman in their culture Such beliefs became ego syntonic because this was the only one they had ever known and it was seen across generations before them hence oppression was their perceived norm strongly reinforced by family and the wider community There were powerful accounts of forced marriages and of the atrocities that occurred within the marriages Across all of the stories there were turning points where women began to resist the harmful socio cultural norms and make a bid for freedom Though freedom was sought the road to freedom was one met with multiple experiences of re victimisation The composite Mehar illustrates this through a story entitled The curse of being a woman see Box Belonging to a culture that oppresses women Mehar s life was dictated from the very beginning her life was to be handed to a man of her parents choice and she would dedicate her life to pleasing him Her fate was sealed from birth forced to endure multiple gender based abuses in her early years in preparation for adulthood I remember as a child I was being mould

community You know the culture we have grown up is very patriarchal The rules are different for boys and girls When we were young we were told that we would be married off at a very early age and we wouldn t have a choice I was very heavily sedated heavily guarded by the family I was transported to India and kept there for years against my will and forced to marry someone My dad said to me if you think about running away I will find you I ll kill you and I ll go to prison I totally believe that he would do that So I was forced to marry a stranger and things went into a snowball after that I moved to England and I was forced to support his sponsor his visa to England All I was told is you have to please the husband I was raped by my husband it was daily rape for eight and a half years of my life I didn t used to eat for days I was underweight depressed getting beaten I had to go to my in laws at the weekend to do all their work I eventually ended up leaving him My family had disowned me at that point My mental health had deteriorated I couldn t see a way out of it I went into a catalogue of addictions like alcohol eating painkillers left right and centre to numb the pain I had so many episodes of overdosing This is what honour based abuse does to you you get bound by tradition in the after effects of trauma because your parents don t teach you to be independent I wish my dad

Umang I guess culturally it s not something that we d ever discussed we re not taught about sex education when we re growing up We re not taught about consent We re not taught about abuse It s always perceived to be something that couldn t or wouldn t happen to us because of how we are quite reserved as people like the culture that I come from just the topic of sex and anything one massive taboo We were virtually forced to go to our uncles we don t even know we were forced to hug people we don t even know That s apparently part of culture and that s what I mean by my mum and dad s relationship I did not see any consent around the whole I ve not been taught I ve not been taught consent around my own body When I was about I was also taken advantage of by my Arabic teacher As soon as I told my mum guess who got told off Why is he doing that to you What for Why What have you done Instead of questioning the actual situation she questioned this Literally minimising my voice The education is always keep things to yourself I m ashamed that it happened I felt that heaviness on my shoulder because my family is thinking oh I m doing whatever I want succeeding going ahead with following my dreams When actually it s far beyond that It is just far beyond that I will never tell my family because they would not talk to me for years I would be the one blamed for it because they are narrow minded and ignorant I shouldn t feel shame for something that wasn t my choice But it s a shame because I know how other people are going to perceive me now That s the shame that stopped me from telling people that I probably should have told who would have wanted to help and support me in that time Recently I went to the local place of worship and spoke to one of the p riests I explained the situation with them about domestic violence The backlash from that was you have to make it work you know he s a man you have to give him attention you have to cook for him you have to clean for him And I thought o ne problem with the whole culture is you know brushing things under the carpet and making things seem that everything will be fine if you try a little harder You know we make domestic violence or sexual abuse look like it s nothing it s a trivial matter I wonder why it happened I d love to know People sexualise girls as exotic Oh you look like Princess Jasmine men always sa y quite inappropriate things I sometimes wonder whether being dual heritage did make a difference Another part is I think that young black girls are sexualised a fair bit more at young ages

understand about healthy relationships They reflected on how silence was reinforced by culture family members and the wider society leaving them feeling powerless but also ashamed when sexual abuse

of abuse Lifetime trauma lifelong cycles of trauma This theme represents cycles of trauma and abuse affecting many participants in the MESARCH project and to an even great extent in our narrative study sample Survivors indicated cycles of violence wherein their early life trauma led to deteriorating mental health which exacerbated risks for further abuse The composite of Madison is entitled Cycles of trauma which captures abuse in childhood coupled with unmet mental health needs and how this exacerbated subsequent abuse and experiences of multiple victimisation see Box The cycle of trauma connects with sub themes of homelessness addiction and repeated patterns of abusive relationships Typology of narratives about access to care for survivors Victims and survivors not recognising abuse or lacking access to information This access typology draws together the many narratives relating to how survivors minimal awareness of abuse could delay help seeking Achieving awareness of coercive behaviours can be particularly problematic because of the insidious nature of domestic abuse and the subtle and exploitative ways in which perpetrators enact abuse see Box Participants accounts highlight the vital role of communities in making information about abuse available People may seek such information at critical turning points in their lives when they may struggle to name the abuse but identify that they are unsafe and at risk see Box Such information BOX Cycles of trauma Madison I had quite a chaotic childhood I had complex trauma from an unstable family background I don t have like a proper family because of my childhood abuse My father didn t sexually abuse me but systematically hit my mother during my childhood I really didn t have anywhere to turn I got to the point of breakdown with post traumatic stress and flashbacks and then that escalated into psychosis and being really really unwell despite all the efforts to maintain my mental health Over the years I ve been a victim of multiple sociopaths and psychopaths These are the sorts of people that I ve attracted as a result of the abuse I ve suffered I ve found that when you ve been in a life threatening situation where you are told to perform sexual acts and you do it then it s very difficult to avoid coercion in any kind of future relationships and control because you ve been in that situation Unfortunately I ended up running away when I was from an abuser and ended up getting abused by a police officer So that s how that started And then as an adult there s been a couple of experiences This was just the tip of iceberg I ended up being in a homeless accommodation in the same town I am still living in today And that is one of the roughest places you can be We lost our house We lost all our possessions Pretty much everything Just to get away from it They local council put me in an accommodation with a woman who used to be a prostitute funnily enough and she tried to pressure me into all sorts And at that point the only way I could cope was with prescription medication which was milligrams of antidepressants gabapentin propranolol and diazepam and alcohol and cocaine I couldn t drink in the morning because of work so cocaine did the job and I could just function My addiction was taking off days off sick were getting a little bit more Then it got to the point where home life was crumbling It became this vicious cycle I ve become a person that just exists My physical health isn t good either and I think it all stems from the abuse I just think the whole thing has systemically battered me NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No BOX If what happened didn t fit in a box it doesn t mean it didn t happen I just wish there was more help initially when people go through sexual abuse that there was kind of more help around what a healthy relationship is and more information about what constitutes saying no Because obviously we have a stereotypical thing where it s like you literally shout No no no no but you don t talk much about like the freeze response or like you ve given him what he wanted because you re scared I think there need to be more conversations around coercion and stuff like that because that s a big concept that I struggled with for many years I said no initially but then I got so scared so I just went along with it and I think that would help so many more victims if that was more talked about rather than just the stereotypical stranger in an alleyway and you re shouting No We have such a black and white view of what rape is But even like the media and stuff portray it differently now because it s not just black and white So we are getting there but I think it s important for victims to realise that if what happened to them didn t fit in that box doesn t mean that it didn t happen BOX Extract from a life narrative to forced marriage and beyond When I was I knew this marriage stuff was looming but I always believed I would have a choice in it My dad and his brother took me to Yorkshire and there I met the man who was going to be my husband I wasn t allowed to be alone with him and we were literally there for half an hour The transaction the deal had already been done What do you think asked my dad on the way home No was my response My dad s words were That s the man you re going to marry whether you like it or not That s when I most wanted a professional in my life or a poster to say I can just talk to somebody It was just like I can t tell anybody about it I was thinking where am I going to run away to anyway I haven t got a qualification to my name So I went through with it I did it at years old and it was surreal days of wedding but I felt like I wasn t there must go beyond addressing the black and white forms of abuse such as physical violence to encompassing hidden forms as identified in Box Individuals formally and informally and organisations across communities being able to ask about abuse when suspected and providing appropriate responses which includes linking victims and survivors to sources of help were cornerstones of access in this research The research identifies many instances of workplaces see Box and university staff supporting survivors to make sense of their difficulties and the abuse and providing information and referrals BOX Workplaces as integral to linking survivors to support I was moved to England and I was forced to sponsor his visa to England I was still under threats and blackmail from my family for the first few years of that marriage I was coerced to have children because it would restore honour I had two sons from this marriage He was alcoholic and abusive throughout this marriage and it took me years to finally get out of it The incident that really changed things was that we were moving in slow moving traffic he was driving me to work and leant over and opened the door and almost pushed me out If it wasn t for the seatbelt he would have thrown me into traffic That shook me I went into work crying and the matron there called me in her office and she asked me what had happened I broke down because judging from the way my parents treated me and the way I was blackmailed and emotionally threatened by my parents that nobody will help me I had a feeling that if I asked for help I wouldn t be helped The matron she calmed me down and she told me there s help for all this Go to your GP there s domestic violence services get your paperwork out bring it to work and store it there we ll keep it safe for you So I did that and took all my boys birth certificates passports and everything and I just left them in the office and I called my doctor and I told her what was happening and she put me through to domestic violence services A few weeks after that I found out that my ex husband was going to take the boys to India We had a major blow out because he was asking for the passports Luckily someone from the Public Protection Unit had called me and arranged to put markers on the house so that if there s any incident and I call then the police know it s priority So I called the police after that and they came and they got us I broke free from the marriage and ended up in refuge provision for a month with my sons

abuse occurs in family settings or environments and communities where abuse is silenced Abuse thrives when helping resources are relatively distal for an individual or community for example linguistically diverse communities may struggle to engage with awareness raising campaigns posters and pamphlets when not designed with their needs and barriers in mind Box identifies the potential of sustained campaigns against abuse and in relation to articulating less well defined aspects of abuse It also draws attention to the multiple ways in which agencies across the third sector can support disclosure and access to justice and SAAS at a critical turning point Potential entry points to care for sexual violence and abuse missed Many participants alluded to recognising that what was happening was abuse but experiencing considerable barriers to escaping the situation Picking up at a later point in the narrative To Forced Marriage and Beyond our participant reflects on not being asked about abuse in an antenatal setting even when they were presented on a third pregnancy loss and in poor health see Box This signals missed opportunities for enabling access to care for sexual violence and abuse exiting domestic abuse The participant in Box explains about why being asked is so important and why spontaneous disclosure without the question being asked is unlikely These cases show that some signs of abuse may be more opaque than others e g miscarriage or mental health problems but this study shows that even when the signs of physical violence were apparent health professionals may have avoided enquiring The following narrative identifies a range in the experience of quality of responses from health providers see Box Many opportunities arise to put a lifeline out there as survivors seek help for the direct effects of abuse as well as other health related issues over the course of experiencing domestic abuse It draws attention to the value of health professionals being able to ask and offer support Professionals do not always recognise the communication difficulties experienced by people who have been exposed to abuse Unless I m asked specific questions I wouldn t know how to communicate because for so many years I d been told to basically keep my mouth shut and told what to say and how to act Related to the difficulties survivors of trauma may experience in communication and decision making the final composite voice see Box shared in this section centres on the vital role and capacity of the NHS to open access to care BOX Campaigns and voluntary sector organisations as enabling access to statutory services One day I saw something or I heard something or I saw an advert that described grooming which alerted me to his behaviour It wasn t until that point my late twenties probably early thirties before I understood exactly what grooming was It all made sense Before I reported it to the police I spoke to the NSPCC I d spoken to several charitable services over the phone for advice I reported it to the police via the NSPCC They made the call on my behalf which helped a lot as it was someone else taking that responsibility for me and there was no turning back now I had taken inspiration and courage from a quote in Lemony Snicket s book The Ersatz Elevator If we wait until we re ready we ll be waiting for the rest of our lives which helped me make that decision I was absolutely devastated about making that phone call I felt guilty about reporting them but I needed some closure to the abuse that I suffered over years of it I needed closure and that was the only way that I was going to do it because if I didn t cut him off myself after a period of time after I d healed myself and moved on he would creep back into

accident and emergency I look back now and I think actually all the times I went to the GP and said my anxiety meds aren t working and I kept going on different tablets Had someone asked me then maybe I would have said something But I needed someone to ask me the question I needed someone to ask me the question When you have all your choices taken off you by someone even making a decision like that you feel like you can t There was one occasion when I went to hospital because I was covered in bruises on my arm Finger print bruises In my head I d talked myself into thinking it was a side effect of my medication my new tablets They couldn t find anything wrong with me they didn t understand why the bruises were there They didn t think it was a side effect I was just a bit dehydrated No one asked how I got the bruises I was hoping someone would ask me so I could tell them It was hand shaped like fingerprints no one did I think there was multiple missed opportunities there With the GP I can understand because they didn t see me again it was COVID It was over the phone so they re going off what I m telling them But with those bruises I think maybe they did I think a lot of people are scared to ask although it s part of their job It s always better to ask the question put a lifeline out there BOX Health professionals sowing the seeds for disclosure Discussing bits and pieces that happened after with GPs was quite difficult You re trying to say that you re unwell and you can feel it in your body Like you just feel uncomfortable in your own skin You always get this bog standard response of we re not qualified in that area to deal with those issues And that s always really disheartening because their response is speak to the police It s on you and it s just on you You have to go search for that help That was the response that seemed to happen a lot And then after a while you just stop asking because what s the point While I was with him I had to go to sexual health services twice because he cheated a lot So he gave me chlamydia twice Even back then and this was before the incident they clearly could see something from the outside of the relationship I remember both times they said If you ever need to come in and talk or if you want to come back for a check up later on that s absolutely fine One of them gave me her name Book an appointment with me and I will be here Like there was just so much more effort They were brilliant Same for the hospital I had a miscarriage and we ended up going to a hospital and they were amazing There was one lady there She actually pulled me into a room I hated just him touching me and she must have noticed because she pulled me aside and she was like Just need to talk to Macy about you know medication I m just going to take her into this side room She asked Is there domestic abuse going on I just looked at her and I remember just sort of like holding back tears We can get you out with your daughter if that s what you want I remember thinking that is all I want and I wanted to say it but I just couldn t get the words out but they were incredible BOX Health professionals promoting key decision making for survivors My GPs have all been really brilliant When I came out of emergency services I got a phone call from him GP and he just said to me I m allowed to override the Hippocratic Oath in your situation because I ve been sent the medical and physical reports from A E and your life is in serious danger and if you haven t gone to the police by such and such a time this afternoon I have been guided and I have the authority from the legal medical practice to go on your behalf to safeguard your life but it would be better coming from you At the time I was like Grrrrr I hate you But I guess in the long run he was doing me a big favour and other people You know they care They care They re more medical I mean mental health that s their interest as well but not as much as like psychotherapists and everything that s my personal experience of my GPs I would say that mental health services have professional experience of people who ve been through severe trauma which enables them to actually open up the field of decision making So having been in a vulnerable position where even making simple decisions has been almost impossible and having been coerced and controlled the mental health services have done the opposite They have actually opened up the field of decision making helped me see how I can be part of that decision making process regarding what medications to take what activities to fill my day with and I would say that that s consistent as an inpatient and as an outpatient Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms

discrimination as blocking access to safety justice and dignity Most participants from culturally diverse backgrounds in this study did not raise racial discrimination enacted towards them as a barrier to accessing SARCs or other forms of care and support after sexual violence and abuse However among those that did the implications of negative and even discriminatory responses for safety well being and progress after abuse exposure were profound The longer composite we present for Simran see Appendix Box highlights the extreme demands facing those who flee domestic abuse all the more marked when a person is trying to keep children safe is isolated has no access to resources and lacks the language skills to manage a complex high risk situation While Simran s story highlights many elements of risk and recovery see later sections our interest here is in the participant s difficulties in accessing what they needed initially Simran s story demonstrates an increasing degree of disempowerment resulting from early interactions with the police other professionals e g social workers interpreters and settings e g hotels and short term accommodation It aggravates the poor state of her mental health and a lack of trust in institutions and services meant when the opportunity for accessing justice more formally did arise Simran was unable to participate in this process Simran was far removed from a SARC sharing her sense of isolation in day to day life I didn t know a doctor and I never went to any temple I didn t know how to go She struggled to communicate to the police about the domestic violence and abuse let alone the sexual violence exposure She was also relying on her child to communicate about their situation to the police and thus she experienced many constraints on what she could disclose There is a strong access theme throughout concerning Simran s daughter s education and which was clearly a priority for Simran engagement around her GCSEs and A level examinations was severely disrupted by the abuse and the upheaval of escaping abuse and temporary accommodation persisting over years Overall this composite shows that examining access in an intersectional framework is critical Understanding racial disparities in access to care and other opportunities requires that we consider power dynamics associated with race such as gender and socioeconomic status which may also have operated here Simran shares about the lack of safety in the refuge environment and how little control they had over who accessed their space People used to knock on our door and my daughter used to be scared We used to get so scared that flashbacks started coming and there wasn t any lock controlled by us there s only one they refuge staff control and we used to think anyone can come and we didn t sleep at all both me and my daughter Simran s mental health needs are substantial but progress towards therapeutic interventions was clearly slow and she reported being on a waiting list for counselling This study intentionally engaged with individuals from a range of different minoritised populations Participants drew attention to important steps taken by agencies to improve access and experiences of service users It was really really helpful to have someone there that I could ask the questions of and just to talk it all through It s with an ISVA that deals with people that are LGBTQ I m married to a woman so I fall into that category I suppose you feel a bit more comfortable knowing that the person on the end of the phone understands

Capturing the essence of the interplay between sociodemographic status and access to health care therapeutic care and justice we present Fay s full narrative see Appendix Box While Fay does find herself at the SARC soon after contacting the police and accessed some services thereafter there is a sense that the care pathway does not hold her on it particularly effectively I had to have the Hep C Hep B injections and I had another blood test as well I should have had a follow up last June but never got a follow up phone call to say Please can you come in so I ve not had a follow up from that

older woman I think the older you are the more difficult it is because I feel that maybe some people are like Oh nobody s going listen to me I m not worth nothing I m not worth the bother Mental health personality disorder used as a bit like a weapon The research has identified mental health diagnoses and longstanding or complex mental health problems as one of the most significant barriers to care and justice for sexual violence and abuse across our sample Box introduces this issue with the person pointing out that their mental health was a greater concern in terms of accessing justice than their cultural background Black British with Afro Caribbean heritage This extract presents concerns about being believed in the CJS and also about how the process of pursuing justice could aggravate their mental health condition Across the sample we detected that mental health was less of a barrier to accessing frontline services such as SARCs and helpline services in the voluntary sector e g MIND SHOUT and the Samaritans than it was to progressing cases through the CJS and accessing appropriate forms of mental health care Many participants of the MESARCH study and those invited into this qualitative study were living with complex PTSD and or had diagnosed personality disorders Such individuals struggled to seek for appropriate care with Jane s core narrative see Appendix Box being illustrative of the many doors that close on survivors with complex mental health Cultural narratives influencing reporting of sexual violence and abuse Here we address how dominant social political and cultural narratives presented in the media about justice for sexual offences can interact with the pursuit of justice and influence how people think about help seeking Box highlights the benefits of SARCs as an alternative or conduit to the police It shows the work undertaken by survivors in balancing the costs of reporting with the costs of not reporting Another participant also explains the work and mental navigating that survivors need to do in the lead up to reporting In this instance see Box accessing EMDR through the NHS changed my life completely and provided them the strength to report the abuse This was particularly needed given their expectations of a negative police response We also gathered evidence of providers grappling with how to guide and respond to queries from their clients about accessing justice see Box Shifting societal and institutional responses to child sexual abuse facilitate access While crime data can be discouraging including such aspects as the low conviction rates for sexual offences there is another perspective on the public response to abuse that arose in this research Steve s narrative see Appendix Box provides a survivor s perspective on how shifts in social responses to BOX If it went to trial would they rip me apart for having bipolar disorder I did have like worries about my mental health more than worries about my cultural background to be honest I think the bonding with the ethnic minorities counsellor was just like a nice add on kind of thing but I definitely had more worries about my mental health playing a part with all of it I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in It s still quite fresh The assault happened in so I was still getting used to medication and getting used to the disorder and everything Still quite fresh with talking to a psychiatrist and my GP That was something I did bring to the ISVA actually I was worried about if we did go to trial would I be able to handle it mentally Also if it went to trial would they rip me apart for having bipolar disorder and not believing me because I have bipolar disorder I went to my GP not long after the assault and was kind of like Look this has happened to me I think I may need like some extra mental health support just in case because I m not sure if I can deal with it Or if I will deteriorate because of the assault and

and stuff what do I do What are my next steps I think it just gave me like options of what local clinics and stuff and then when I phoned they booked me into that one I hadn t even heard of SARCs before that I guess in my head this is quite silly but I used to watch a lot of Law and Order SVU In my head I was like You go straight to the police and they do all the paperwork all the tests and all of that And I was kind of like I don t really want to go to the police right now I literally went to the SARC the very next morning and it was like a surprisingly nice experience they would be welcoming and kind and I was like being offered way too much food so it was quite sweet You don t know what to expect when you re going through that experience definitely But yeah it was really good They gave me the options if I wanted to take it to the police there and then And also the sexual health referral like on the day or if I wanted to refer myself So I accepted all that Had the swabs done and everything I didn t want to report for a very long time I guess because I d seen the stats already of how it s dealt with and how you re very unlikely to get a trial and stuff and how it s unlikely to go further than a trial and everything And then when I went to the ISVA she was telling me like almost the pros and cons and letting me make that decision just kind of telling me Well this is exactly what would happen and it was kind of like a really long experience and would kind of get like I already know if it did get to trial you do get dragged through the mud almost And I was like I m not sure if I want to do that I m not sure if that s good for me and my mental health But then the more I was thinking about it the more I was thinking that I can t let this happen to someone else as well Then it didn t go to trial or anything they didn t fit into it I was disappointed about it for a long time But then I was also like well I ve seen the stats and barely anyone does I was like

the police not for any particular reason but I ve read a lot online You hear bad stories about the police So I didn t go in with a particularly good outlook but I thought I ll try it see what happens because it s a historical thing I don t know if they can prove it It s just my word against his The police have been absolutely wonderful they ve kept me informed Every couple of weeks if I ve not heard anything they ll give me a message or they ll give me a ring I ve always had a point of contact Even the interview process was easy to do they told me where to go it wasn t in a big scary police station it was in a housing estate No one would know where you re going I always felt very well informed of what could or could not happen which I really appreciated BOX Professionals influence decisions to report or not I think when I went to rape crisis centre the first time it was kind of said to me that there s not much point you reporting it to the police because of how low the conviction rate is Although obviously conviction rates are really low and we see it every day I think that completely put me off reporting it because I felt well if they re even saying it what s the point kind of thing But even if nothing happens reporting it means a file is open I wish that I was supported more with the whole police thing Because by the time that I reported it in I didn t have any evidence on me so it couldn t really go anywhere But if I had supplied stuff back then because I did have like the texts and stuff I could have provided more evidence then than I did in sexual abuse have enabled him to take steps towards justice and alleviate some of the burden on him mentally and socially that he had experienced over decades Accessing the right care and therapies Within

mismatch between therapy offering and needs The research gives a sense of services struggling to consistently and effectively provide care for sexual violence and abuse and mental health needs This is apparent at the primary care level where guidance is sought and in psychiatry services that may lack trauma informed practice see Box Typology of narratives about recovery and healing Reading of the narrative interview transcripts has highlighted three core narratives that broadly map people s experiences of recovery These include narratives aligned to a sense that I cannot narratives aligned with the sense that I am recovering and narratives aligned with the sense that I feel recovered Each of these core narratives is set out below and the sub narratives that participants drew on to explain where they are in their recovery journeys are identified I cannot recover Participants whose journeys aligned with this core narrative identified a number of factors and experiences that contributed to the challenges in recovery see Table These include experiences after rape sexual assault or sexual abuse that continue to make a survivor feel unsafe such as having to live in or near the place where the assault took place or not knowing if the perpetrator was still around and able to reach them There is also a strong connection between having trauma from childhood complex trauma poor physical and mental health and lack of recovery within these narratives A sense that there is broader societal support for the perpetrator also comes through as damaging to recovery Societal support for the perpetrator A number of narratives draw out the sense that perpetrator behaviour can be considered normal and not warrant intervention by the authorities as indicated in Box below where the participant reports on the response of some of her friends when she disclosed to them that she had been raped BOX Poor practice in primary and secondary settings in enabling access to therapy They didn t really give me much help they were kind of like Oh well you ve already been in contact with the rape counselling and then you don t have another appointment with your psychiatrist until this time and like maybe you can phone in to talk to the nurse for a bit and I was like Well I don t want to talk to the nurse I want to have like a proper appointment where I can sit down and discuss my fears So I kind of felt a bit let down I did have one recent experience that really knocked me off I moved into my new flat in a completely different area so they had to give me a new psychiatrist and a different doctor My new psych nurse like in our first get to know each other basically just went Oh by the way have you ever been like assaulted or abused in the past I was just like What Surely that s not the way that you word things to everyone and surely you can understand that could be quite triggering for people I was like Yes I have Then she was like Oh can you tell me about it No care no care just very clinical I think that is like one of the big issues with psychiatrists anyway and it did really like knock me off I don t know how to tell her she s not doing a good job at this BOX Normalising and diminishing response to a survivor s experience of sexual assault They friends kept saying Oh that don t surprise me of what the perpetrator did and then it goes Oh one of his friends said He s done something to other people in the past which made me feel sick to my stomach Was like it felt like they were er what s the word supporting him the perpetrator and not understanding what happened behind those closed doors Especially when he was in the house share and nobody was there like I couldn t do anything It made me feel very vulnerable like it still does to

course she had been offered to reduce her risk of being a victim again in the future It illustrates the tendency for society to place the responsibility for not being raped or sexually assaulted on women although of course not all victims are women rather than on perpetrators and their behaviour Complex trauma and physical illness Participants whose narratives featured a lack of recovery often talked about having complex trauma rooted in experiences of childhood abuse or childhood trauma They talked about the effect on their physical and mental health see Fay s narrative in Appendix Box Participants with these experiences found it difficult to access services that responded to complex needs a or week programme is identified as incapable of addressing this complexity see Box Physical or visual reminders of the abuse or the abuser Another feature of narratives focused on the lack of recovery of the participant was related to being reminded of the abuse visually One example of this was where a participant describes moving back to be near her family hoping for their support with caring for her children only to be confronted with her abuser again see Box For another participant smartphones sending reminders of old photos could cause flashbacks Participants faced many situations not necessarily unsafe situations which served as reminders of past abuse and could trigger a response and obstructed recovery I am recovering Within the narratives there are stories about the long and ongoing process of recovery Many people talked about having achieved some sense of recovery or having made progress in that direction There was a sense of hopefulness that recovery would come and that a range of factors were identified as important or linked to the process For example moving to get away from the location where an assault BOX Programmes for spotting perpetrators I remember someone at some point saying about some course I could identify red flags or predators and I just thought Wait what Why do I have to do that work I thought he was my friend Like nothing about him gave me the impression that he was a predator They re implying that you re some kind of idiot who just lets predators in your door I just remember thinking Why does that programme even exist Like why are we making women sit through these programmes that make them feel like they re stupid for having let this person into their lives because actually predators are really clever and they find ways to do it It s the men we need to work on They re the ones who need to go on the courses Pause We can work out which ones are the predators and put a sticker on them They re the problem not us I just Yeah I remember when they offered me that just being like Hello BOX Deep trauma identified as too complex for a brief time limited therapy You know these week not even week week courses you know I don t know how they expect someone with trauma to get everything out in those weeks You know because you re only in there for minutes and by the time you re settled in and ready to talk and something comes up they ve got to leave For me it just stirred up a whole bag of emotions just spinning around like a washing machine There s many parts to my personality now that I just don t understand I don t understand me anymore I don t know I just I mean my days are getting shorter and shorter because sometimes I suffer insomnia as well Through the night you re going over what has happened and the event so consequently during the day I might want to have a little sleep and I can actually sleep in my chair sometimes My energy levels are completely bust I just don t do very much I get up eventually I have a shower By the time I ve done that I m exhausted Come downstairs have something to eat and then I need another rest because I ve done that I ve exerted myself doing that I think I m a burden on everyone I think sometimes it will be simpler if I wasn t here and they could get on with their lives

to the family village where I was brought up back into the pit of depravity I suppose thinking that would be a good move with my two daughters because my family had shown some kind of interest in helping me which didn t happen I was out of They were in control again and I wasn t in control of my own life or my children s lives So the depression got really bad Obviously this family member who had committed the abuse when she was a child was in the village as well so I bumped into him quite often And I d have this slight numbing effect whenever I Well if I saw him I wouldn t ever speak to

the abuser above People also talked about their efforts in engaging with the internal process of tackling mental health problems and a growing sense of passion for seeking justice and seeing justice as part of a bigger societal picture Having good support from others in their lives was also important People also discussed various types of physical activity or exercise as being helpful for recovery Justice and its relationship with healing For many survivors of sexual violence and abuse there is no court process as many cases do not pass the threshold of evidence required Some of the participants had had cases where the justice system was involved however and that was playing an important role in their recovery see Steve s narrative in Appendix Box For others there was a sense that getting justice was part of an important statement about the wider issue of violence against women and sexual violence and abuse in society It s not just my battle to fight either It s not just about me and my body that he actually stripped of dignity and it was just so atrocious but it s actually an offence against the state There was a sense that people were putting life and recovery on hold while waiting for their case to go through the justice system as illustrated in Box Struggling with mental health problems and getting support Everyone described the impact of their assault on their mental health and well being and generally struggling with the ups and downs as part of the recovery journey Getting the right support could be difficult Examples from some of the narratives are

kind of person who would always want adventure and to do these fun things and I m just the kind of person who is like doing like the safest most stable thing possible I d love to get to a point where I feel okay to take risks and I feel okay to do the crazy things that I used to do and know that I would be able to like fall back on myself and that like I ll be fine So that s my aspiration The journey I m on at the moment I think because I have this investigation I have court dates that type of thing it s very much like split in the back of my brain I haven t really felt it and that works really well for me and I m going to have to deal with it formally in the future and I think it s a really good idea not to think about it beforehand So my approach has been for the whole last year erm uh back of the brain don t think about it Deal with it later And that s okay I think Like it s going to be shit down the line and then I m going to dig it out and then it ll be fine Copyright O

TO SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES AMONG RACIALLY MINORITISED BOX Experience with mental health problems I do still think about it to this day Since then I ve suffered with anxiety and depression just constantly It s alright at the moment but I wouldn t say it s the best and I wouldn t say it s the worst I felt that it has massively affected me it s affected my mental health to this day It s almost two and a half years since it happened but it still affects my mental health today I tried to do talking therapies but what they instantly wanted to do was not trauma therapy but behavioural therapy CBT for the anxiety and the depression so I just cancelled that because they could never actually solve what I was actually thinking of and go for the trauma I m still waiting on the trauma therapy They said they d call or email me when it s available I ve had no email and I ve had no call but I ll still wait for that one BOX Experience of pre existing mental health problems I ve been in therapy for about years now The medication has its ups and downs trying to find the correct um like counselling that you need to do and kind of thing but it s been quite good and very supportive My mental health in the beginning following the sexual assault wasn t as bad because I was kind of convincing myself that nothing happened it wasn t that bad because I was quite intoxicated when it the sexual assault happened I was trying to convince myself every possible way that it wasn t what it was it was fine Then it started to give me really bad flashbacks and PTSD on top of my already severe and anxious like severe depression and anxiety that I ve had I was unable to leave my room I was trapped in that room for a very long time I never have like I have never had good sleeps like just with it Mentally I m doing a lot better I still get the help I still have all the contacts if I need any help but I m doing a lot better BOX Mismatch between body and brain and impact on decision making The frustration for me is that it feels like my brain is somehow stuck in the past but also like well it s just not quite matched up with my body My body s telling me something like You need to rest now And I m still so restless that I need to kind of pace myself or do excessive exercise or I m so tired that I just stay in bed for days and days on end My body s telling me one thing my brain is telling me something a little bit different sometimes and I ve found that mismatch to be quite challenging I ve found that when you ve been in a life threatening situation where you are told to perform sexual acts and you do it then it s very difficult to avoid coercion in any kind of future relationships and control because you ve been in that situation I won t go into the details of date of assault but it was over a forty eight hour period It makes you lose confidence in your own decision making I ve found decision making quite hard even just basic decision making and then you let other people take over and I guess that s why I got into the drug scene briefly Using mind body connecting activity as therapy e g yoga meditation A number of participants whose narratives aligned with having made some progress in recovery and who had hope for recovery talked about having found various forms of mind body connecting activity and physical activity as helpful including running marathons yoga meditation and art therapy Excerpts from their stories illustrating this are provided see Boxes Accepting that recovery is a process and there are ups and downs Another feature of stories that conveyed recovery expressed a sense of hope for the future and an acceptance that recovery would take time and include both better times and difficult times These participants wanted to keep working at their recovery journey Examples of these hopeful narratives are provided see Boxes and Supportive partners and other relationships The importance of positive supportive relationships in recovery was discussed by most people In particular new partners featured within people s narratives see Box People often talked about supportive friends and family members and an example of the contribution of parenting to thriving in the years after exposure to sexual violence and abuse has been provided see Box NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No BOX Online yoga classes have helped I do yoga an online yoga class which I find quite good for grounding Yeah I m finding the yoga s actually really really helpful It s just I ve had the same teacher it s I get it free because I m on benefits but it s through those WEA courses online They re really good but the tutor s very very good and um yeah I think it is I m finding that quite helpful Um yeah I think mostly feel safe BOX Exercise yoga meditation and journal keeping have helped Sometimes I get like not flashbacks but just like vivid memories really or things will just make me think of stuff and I will have nasty nightmares about stuff that happened So that could definitely kind of give me a wobble I feel good I have like ups and downs It feels like hard work sometimes to stay okay but I have lots of things I do and ways of managing to cope and just to generally kind of keep me feeling okay and it really helped I think a lot of it has just been the way I think about things I think I never thought of myself as a strong person and it helped me to realise I am I just kind of being able to like feel that in my body and think I am strong just kind of helps me I exercise regularly I run and do workouts yoga meditate and keep a journal They re all things that kind of help me feel okay or help me if I m not feeling okay BOX Running marathons and setting personal goals has helped The complaints and that aside I ve been okay I ve tried to find my focus again in things that I enjoy I like running triathlons and stuff like that I ve set myself some pretty big goals for this year It s to help me focus and give me that sense of purpose to be driven towards a new achievement which has really helped in my recovery I don t want or need pills to make me feel better I just want to celebrate what I can do be the very best I can be I m doing a half marathon two marathons months apart and in between I ve got a couple of events already booked a half IronMan in July which will be amazing as I ve never done anything as crazy as that before I am keeping myself busy with all these challenges and that is what drives me to becoming a better version of myself BOX Art therapy has helped I ended up having art therapy with specialist provider of sexual violence support services in the end and they were really really good I think after the sort of initial experience I was a bit wary bringing up the dissociative identity disorder as a main issue and I figured maybe I could work through it without that being at the forefront of the therapy I could do the work outside of the sessions as well and so if I had anything that I didn t maybe I thought she wouldn t understand or I I didn t want to bring it up then I could do that outside So we did the sessions on Zoom so if I wanted to then I could show her the work or email her photos and things The collaging was was my favourite I had a real aversion to watercolours because I found them difficult for a good artist to paint with but we worked through that which was really cool We started doing painting because I ve always been quite afraid of mess so that really really nice to overcome that I think it helped with the DID because it helped personalities that expressed themselves without necessarily needing to speak particularly when I didn t have anyone to speak to so that was really useful in those alone times But it helped with everything as well BOX Continuing the recovery journey and working at it I just wanna continue on that journey and be a little bit more stable a little less emotional I don t know if that will ever happen for me because these are things that affect your life but I d like to contain it a bit more And for me I know what the end goal is I want to work You know once I have gone through all I need to go through because there s a lot I ve got to unpack I want to help other people like me I wanna work in a children s CSE child sexual exploitation home I want to help other people and turn my misery into something good I m currently in the process of writing a book bit of an autobiography of my past experiences trauma and

assault But it still is not something I ve forgotten Things will remind me of it It s harder than I thought it would be to brush those moments off I ve moved away from uni by design to get out of that environment but like it s still with me mentally and I guess it s changed the way that I kind of carry myself and I know that although I was doing really well on my anxiety before that then after that it s just been like a massive spike and I ve had to build from there again I m definitely not healed from it I don t know if that s anything in my soon future Um I think that I m happy to like openly accept it like say it happened And like if it s like in conversation like I m not going to shy away from it Um but I think there s still part of me that feels like if I had done something different like it would have never happened I know that s not how I should feel but but yeah I think things things are starting to change and I think one of I guess the biggest tools in that is social media I ve found a lot of helpful resources which is surprising but I would say I m hopeful that everyone s better equipped BOX The care of a supportive partner But then I met my ex and he was a really gentle person and I actually think that was a huge part of my healing journey Actually I think it was one of the most significant things that happened to me was getting into a really loving kind nurturing patient relationship with someone who was just when it came to things like consent he was all over that To feel like I d met someone who knew Despite his flaws and the reason why we broke up like made me feel like I have like autonomy again of like what I was doing BOX Relationship with child has been a powerful source of help My son I m very focused on him he s doing really well I m so proud of him People say You re a single parent you do really well for yourself and he s thriving as well Those positive words to hear that from other people is really uplifting It s me and my son in the future and he s my rock He is if I didn t have him I probably wouldn t be here today I m also very grateful that I didn t take my own life those years ago as I wouldn t have achieved any of the things I have done so far Moving away Lastly in relation to those in the process of recovery participants often referred to having to move away from the location where the assault or abuse had occurred to aid recovery This maps onto to similar comments about barriers to recovery see I cannot recover above Boxes provide examples drawn from three narratives of recovery BOX I need to get out I m leaving I tried to make the area and the flat where assault happened a place where I could feel happy and reclaim that space but actually what I realised over the months is that I wasn t able to do that so I did need to vacate I would say that was the kind of real crash well more like a sense of Right I really do need to get out because being in the area was just haunting me When I vacated which was in March so six months later I got to the point of breakdown with post traumatic stress and flashbacks and then that escalated into psychosis and being really really unwell despite all the efforts to maintain my mental health I kept going to recovery meetings like various sorts of twelve step meetings online mental health groups So I was checking in at every turn but then there did come a point where I thought Right I just need to get out I m leaving BOX Not able to move but tried to change things I didn t move I did want to move but finances obviously don t allow that So I ve had to literally change the d\u00e9cor of my house everything to try and avoid the reminders I ve basically redecorated moved everything around of that side to try and basically forget it it still hasn t fully worked but it s at least something I am still holding out hope it s just that I might try again with the doctor and ask for therapy or see if I can go private NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No BOX Moving away provides space to process things As I grew up I sort of carried on at the mental health services at school as well and at university and then eventually managed to move out of the family home where the abuse has taken place so that was a huge step in terms of being able to process things in a space of safety I think having that safety mentally sort of allowed loads of repressed memories to come up That s when I realised I wanted and was able to get help properly I started by approaching name of SARC that helped me access specialist provider of sexual violence support services and they were brilliant They were really really helpful I also later on went to provider of ISVA services I feel recovered For some participants they were able to tell a story of more complete recovery They still expressed experience of trauma and having been on a journey but felt that they had reached a positive place that they could call recovery In addition to the factors described by those participants above additional features of these narratives included commentary about recent societal progress in talking about sexual violence a further range of therapies and support and getting good consistent support from a range of sources see Table Societal progress talking openly and online help One participant talked about the experience of a growing openness in society to discuss the issue ofCSA and found this very helpful for recovery see full core story in Appendix Box Similarly the growth in online information to support self help and learning was identified as beneficial by another participant and a source of empowerment see Box What works is different for everyone What was noticeable about the narratives we gathered from participants was how every person s path to recovery differed In addition to the commentary about meditation yoga exercise and art therapy outlined above other helpful therapies and strategies included EMDR see Box spirituality and religion forgiveness see Box and a type of visualisation meditation see Box Consistent support from all sources A final feature of the recovery narratives among those who seemed to feel the greatest sense of recovery was the consistency of support they had received from a range of individuals and support BOX Access to information a powerful tool for self help I don t think I would have recovered as well if I didn t do my own research and my own self help but obviously the internet can be a dodgy place and you can end up making yourself feel worse But I think trying to increase my self awareness around what happened to me and the effects like reading into the complex PTSD side of things and stuff constantly working on yourself has really helped me get to where I am today Because what I was like after that incident compared to now is two different people and like I said it wasn t because of therapy or anything It was a lot because of my own work that I put into it I think having sort of good resources online and stuff is really helpful BOX EMDR helped I ended up having EMDR therapy through it was free so it was through the NHS It was great to have access to that it changed my life completely Absolutely completely changed my life Since my EMDR therapy I m fine to talk about everything it s not a problem really Nowhere near as much as it used to be After the first session it was really difficult and it bought up all the memories again that you try and forget but the way they make you that your brain sort of starts working instead of being like this triggers me you know you see it out and about and instead of triggering you you think of yeah there s that thing You carry on with your day I don t fully understand how I did it They talked you through you know you ve talked through a particular scenario not even the worst part of your experience it could have been any part and you just let your brain take you where it took you It was really strange after two or three sessions seeing that particular scenario that you go over and over seeing how your brain changes I was already feeling so much difference That therapy it was before the COVID pandemic so two and a half years ago and even still I feel okay Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al

RACIALLY MINORITISED BOX Forgiveness helped That was also sort of a similar time when I decided that I was going to forgive my dad and I called off the police investigation and actually I just managed to close quite sort of that chapter and start working on the forgiveness and forgiving my mum as well and having more of a relationship with her So for my mental health that was definitely the best thing I think outside of the space created by church there is so much encouragement and rightfully so for people to come forward to report these things to make sure that justice is served and that we get justice for what s happened to us I feel maybe a teeny bit guilty saying it because I know that other women struggle with the coming forward but for me it s been so much easier and so much more valuable to actually just let go of it and forget about it and I know that s a privilege that I have that other people don t have But for me it s been the right thing definitely BOX Visualisation meditation helped My mental health team dropped me after the trainee left But luckily there was the spiritual lady I don t know what else to call her She did things alternatively like visualisation techniques with you Basically it was like meditation Understanding that I can distance myself Like if I m with a group of people and I don t feel comfortable at any point if there were any actions words anything like that I can still pour love to those people without emptying my cup Like you are allowed to have connections from a distance You re allowed to take two minutes to yourself When you re sat in a group full of people and you know you re suddenly in a panic or a whirlwind you re allowed to sit there and just go sorry guys I m just out of this conversation for a minute Um and just visualise yourself It s things like visualisation like light coming from your feet up to your head Like just your inner lightbulb where you re protected and no one can hurt you services This is illustrated in Steve s narrative see Appendix Box Positive skilled responses from a range of people support organisations and the wider system can contribute to a sense of strong support even when criminal justice proceedings are slow or non existent There s a sense of sharing the burden within these narratives such that the recovery and healing journey is not done alone but in collaboration with range of professionals and agencies with family and friends and with colleagues and communities Discussion Summary of main findings Our analysis of the participants narrative data has been presented across three different typologies We identified narratives relating to narratives relating to risk of experiencing sexual violence and abuse accessing support in the aftermath of sexual assault or abuse and narratives relating to recovery aligned to lack of recovery progress in recovery and hope for the future and feeling a sense of recovery We purposively sampled people from minoritised and underserved communities from our wider cohort study and included a sample of people from outside of our cohort recruited through third sector organisations to include voices of those who have not accessed support through SARCs These analyses likely represent the largest scale qualitative investigation to date of the experiences of such a diverse range of minoritised groups experiences and journeys in the aftermath of rape sexual assault and sexual and domestic abuse Our findings highlight the fact that recognition of what constitutes rape and abuse may act as a barrier to seeking help and that many forms of sexual violence and abuse can occur in a complex web of community and family norms which serve to hide the abuse and create additional barriers to seeking help and support including the opportunity to escape from abusive domestic situations The health and social care workforce needs to be culturally competent in understanding when they might need to ask questions and to do so in safe ways Disseminating information about how to access support in safe ways to people in all communities who may be suffering or at risk is needed to support better access NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Professionals also need to be trained to be confident in intervening when a victim survivor may not feel able to take the first step but they are in danger In Simran s story see Appendix Box it is clear how the structure of the system inadvertently acted in a discriminatory way to block her and her child s access to safety justice and the right support to recover There are additional experiences shared that draw out the positives of a LGBTQ focused response and the potential negative influences of intersections of social disadvantage older age and pre existing mental health conditions can have Together these serve to highlight the need for outreach and services that take account of these characteristics This is particularly pertinent where we have evidence that some minoritised groups may be at greater risk of sexual violence It was interesting that although we did not set out to explore risk of victimisation our participants presented narratives around risk In addition to the risk of re victimisation that experiencing abuse can bring the risk narratives also drew out some of the ethnically and culturally minoritised experiences of people for whom that characteristic was relevant Risks included the taboo nature of discussing relationships and sex and deeply entrenched patriarchy as well as cultural practices such as forced marriage and honour based violence Changes in societal and therefore professional understandings and attitudes towards victims survivors of sexual violence was cited by participants as helpful in relation to both access to support and their ongoing recovery journey There was recognition that people are more open to talking about this issue than in the past and a greater tendency towards believing survivors and aiming to be trauma informed Accompanying this societal change is burgeoning information available to people on the internet which was included in one of the recovery narratives of our participants The availability of online information and psychoeducation for support can empower survivors to take control of their recovery journey Continued pervasive societal norms that act in support of perpetrator behaviour was also cited however as detrimental to recovery journeys H ence our data reflect helpful societal progress but the need to continue to push to further this empowering and supportive agenda These findings align with recent discussion in the academic literature about the need to understand better the structural and social causes of sexual and domestic violence in our attempts to prevent it and support those who are victims of it There were challenges identified in relation to accessing the right kind of care with many of our participants talking about unsuccessful attempts at therapy and inadequate offers of care that did not suit their needs Ultimately our narratives where there is hope of recovery demonstrate a level of acceptance that recovery will be a long road and that a range of different therapies and mind and body connecting activity such as yoga and meditation may be useful for that process These findings reflect those from our two Cochrane Reviews to some extent which provide emerging evidence of benefit from less traditional interventions and therapies such as trauma informed yoga see Chapter of this report Similar to our qualitative Cochrane Review which found that interventions led to a wide range of benefits the narratives of our participants showed recovery as having a range of different outcomes that they viewed as beneficial including reductions in anxiety and flashbacks and the ability to engage in activities that they enjoyed doing such as physical activity and volunteering Narratives of access and of recovery encompassed the particular challenges there are for those who have complex trauma to deal with These are often individuals who have experienced a number of ACEs including abuse and neglect who have a pre existing mental health condition and who may be experiencing domestic as well as sexual violence They may have been victimised many times and be at risk of re victimisation They may also have children to take care of Services are not set up to provide the tailored bespoke multi faceted and multi d isciplinary care that survivors with these patterns of abuse need The narratives of our participants show this poor response to complex cases is likely contributing to the lack of recovery experienced Copyright O

TO SExUAL ASSAULT REFERRAL CENTRES AMONG RACIALLY MINORITISED Strength and limitations Large scale qualitative inquiry into the support and recovery experiences of survivors of sexual violence is challenging to accomplish A strength of this study is that it has achieved the collation of detailed narratives of these experiences from a large sample of SARC service users as well as survivors who have not accessed SARC The sample likely represents the most diverse to date in terms of its representation of cultural linguistic and ethnic groups It includes people of different genders and sexual orientation and a range of ages and levels of socio economic status and education It highlights the hope there is for recovery across these diverse groups but also the gaps in support that exist for those experiencing complex trauma and from the most underserved communities A further strength of this study is the way it complements the more traditional cohort and health economic analysis of outcomes valuing multiplicity of knowledge and giving weight to experiential knowledge Its inclusion within the research process has created opportunities for epistemic justice where silenced or marginalised voices are amplified As one participant put it I wanted to really have a voice because I felt in other areas when I was speaking up before about how I was feeling it was getting diminished or just ignored We acknowledge that a limitation was that we reached far fewer participants from non SARC support contexts than intended Those we have reached provided detailed narratives and provided insights into the complexity of intersecting forms of marginalisation how these interact with sexual violence and abuse risk and the nature of barriers to service access This part of the study further illustrated the resilience of individuals and communities in the aftermath of abuse and the creative and personal ways in which people navigate life after trauma Implications for health care Health and care and support services have an important role to play in the recovery of survivors of sexual violence and abuse Getting a good response from services matters and can contribute to good recovery The response of wider society matters too though e g see our whatareyoudoing campaign and efforts to improve cultural and societal norms that may contribute to sexual violence and abuse and create the context for recovery are needed as well Better outreach and training for staff to support those still in abusive environments to escape abuse and get support are needed Support for those experiencing complex trauma histories multiple victimisation with complex mental health and personal circumstances are also needed to avoid exacerbating health inequalities and meet the needs of the most vulnerable survivors Recommendations for research Future research should focus in more depth on those with the most complex needs and who do not make it to care through SARCs Given that minoritised groups are often least likely to access support in the aftermath of sexual violence via SARCs it is not yet clear whether SARCs are the best care option for all NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Chapter Discussion This section overviews the key findings from across the MESARCH project studies considers limitations of the project overall sets out overarching implications for SARCs and for health care more broadly and makes recommendations for future research Main findings Given the breadth and complexity of this year project we have presented the key mixed methods findings according to a typical SARC pathway Pre SARC A primary focus of this research was to understand what promotes or deters access to SARCs Through sharing their personal narratives and experiences participants shaped where and when their story starts with most of them taking us far into the past This lifespan lens underscores how for many survivors risk for sexual violence and abuse begins early in life This risk is reinforced by power dynamics connected with race gender socioeconomic status religion sexuality and disability shown by our research team and others Our qualitative study identified gender based violence rooted in gender inequality as a risk factor especially poignant among the racially minoritised community sample of non SARC attendees Another theme concerned silencing We gathered widespread accounts of risk arising from a lack of early education and everyday discourse about relationships intimacy and sex When sexual violence and abuse did occur the milieu of customary silence rendered survivors voiceless and unable to draw on otherwise available informal support networks and certainly not formal support While there was a clear historical context for silencing among many of our older participants and a clear minoritisation context for many of the culturally diverse participants silencing and shame about abuse was ever present in narratives irrespective of time place or people s backgrounds The absence of tools for talking about abuse and seeking help and the debilitating context of shame was exploited and could perpetuate the abuse The final area of risk concerns a triad of trauma poor mental health and insecurity Individual and composite narratives bear witness to life struggles as people strived to exit cycles of escaping abuse leading to unstable unsafe living conditions and escaping chaotic risky living thrusting people back into risk victimisation and all this occurring in a context of long term mental health problems which included substance misuse among the most minoritised participants in our samples A central tenet is that trauma itself is a risk factor that continues to compound and shape risk and recovery Our quantitative analysis on risk and mental health burden at entry to our cohort study effectively triangulated these qualitative findings Consistent with the findings of other studies of people affected by sexual assault and abuse and attendees at SARCs of participants joining the study had a prior history of mental health problems For survivor level factors pre existing mental health problems were associated with a point difference on baseline PTSD compared to those without long term mental health difficulties each additional ACE was associated with a point greater score on PTSD symptoms there was strong evidence and an apparent dose response for PTSD symptoms being higher for those with fewer financial resources with a point difference and strong evidence that being unable to work was associated with a point higher baseline PTSD score As such it is critical that we adopt an intersectional framework for considering the implications of MESARCH findings for two reasons Firstly we need it to make sense of their complexity we are witnessing layers of interconnecting power dynamics at play in the lives of survivors that relate to gender race socioeconomic status and disability especially if we consider the burden of mental health as frequently the basis for survivors being unable to work Secondly there is the sheer scale Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health and

options build workforce resilience skills and competencies and achieve effective lifelong care must draw on a framework that centralises parity Bearing in mind that the quantitative data are provided by participants who have managed to access help it is concerning to consider the risk profile in communities and subgroups who are unable or prevented from getting help We do not wish to lose sight of the fact that abuse crosses all sociodemographic lines and our sample included many individuals and communities without traditional risk factors two thirds were educated to A level or above approximately half reported few or no financial problems and many people were in work and the vast majority of participants was not racially minoritised Yet our careful categorisation and analysis of the sample s characteristics revealed a burden of childhood trauma ACEs that was noteworthy Nearly four in every five participants in the study indicated four or more ACEs widely considered as a threshold beyond which people are at risk of poor long term mental and physical health outcomes Sexual assault referral centres access and experiences of care We now move beyond discussing risk to presenting insights into people s experiences of accessing SARCs and then the care and support obtained in that setting Rich data from across the project extend our understanding about access to SARCs as well as to the wider context of health voluntary sector and social care services and justice addressed further on see Figure Survivors in this project had accessed SARCs and delays and barriers to accessing SARC resided at individual family and community levels such as people not knowing about SARCs not being ready to seek help not being able to After the incident that happened to me I was in

specific crisis emotional support and forensic care were not priorities and were neglected for long periods with pervasive long term effects Overall nearly of the recruited sample had accessed SARCs in the first days since the sexual assault down from a pre COVID pandemic level of and the most typical perpetrator type was acquaintance followed by partner perpetrated sexual violence and abuse and strangers of people in the sample had sought help in relation to exposure to CSA Approximately of people had a FME The delivery of health care and support by SARCs was consistently evaluated by survivors as exemplary This finding was consistent across our cohort study process evaluation and narrative study of minoritised groups Our findings revealed no indicators of systemic harm and half of the survivors accessing SARCs rated them as or above for benefit in meeting needs arising from exposure to sexual violence and abuse While behind every number there is a person and the research has examined individual level responses just four individuals reported SARCs had been harmful to them This was the lowest rate of harm detected across any sector in this research Our SARC process evaluation emphasised the importance of cohesive regional partnerships between SARCs and multiple statutory and voluntary sector agencies This was also observed and articulated by survivors with regard to their satisfaction with on site care referrals and follow up We view SARCs as a vital gateway to recovery and it is often survivors first encounter with care in relation to sexual violence and abuse As such it is crucial that SARCs provide a safe individualised response that facilitates the person to continue on the care pathway as our research shows that there are multiple factors that can derail a person from continuing this journey Post SARC access and experiences of care One of the main features of care after SARC was the ISVA service a professional to advocate for and support survivors through the criminal justice process Depending on the local model some survivors continued care with a SARC provided ISVA for others they were referred to an ISVA provided by the voluntary sector ISVAs were integral to an effective pathway and for the most part survivors did not report difficulties accessing ISVA services and adapted during the COVID pandemic to receiving that care online Furthermore survivors reported high levels of satisfaction with the support provided by ISVAs In the study there were more than contacts with ISVAs at baseline had an ISVA falling to at year in line with the reduction in open cases from to Participants expressed difficulties when ISVA care was withdrawn in response to case closure and there appears to be variation nationally in the extent to which ISVAs can be accessed or maintained independent of criminal proceedings The problem of access was much greater in relation to counselling services in the voluntary sector Capacity issues did not affect SARCs to the same degree and many survivors accessed other forms of support at SARCs e g information and advice structured emotional support sessions to assist them in the time they were on waiting lists Young people did express concerns especially young people from minoritised backgrounds This system isn t very inclusive It s not very accessible and a lot of ethnic minorities and young black girls are subject to sexual violence at a young age and you have people in the system who don t understand those backgrounds don t understand the sociology behind them and how they ended up being the victims of what they were I think it s just leading to a lack of justice being provided There s not an understanding of the lives of the people that are involved The findings of the study suggested that participants accessed a wide range of healthcare and other public sector services with GP visits and police contacts comprising the highest number of reported contacts Although service use was higher among our participants at baseline representing a period of nearly days since participants had accessed a SARC this decreased over time for example NHS contacts reduced from almost four contacts at baseline to less than one contact per person at months covering to the previous months While a full embedding of the wider health and social care access experiences within wider literature

Journals Library and the DOI of the publication must be cited DISCUSSION survivors mental health as a primary barrier to access in all settings For example in the NHS survivors struggled to be provided with psychological care specific to sexual abuse when they had co existing mental health diagnoses because the latter was focused upon There were parallels here with survivors in domestic abuse services where there were gaps in care for the sexual abuse that had been perpetrated by partners Another common scenario was being unable to access therapies on the NHS seen as appropriate for complex trauma Yet another was NHS referral loops patterns of GP referral to mental health and discharge back to GPs who were often seen to be ill equipped or unwilling to support mental health needs of survivors Formal mental health expertise to identify and support mental health concerns remains limited within the SARC skill mix the MiMoS project found that staff lacked clarity about pathways into the mental health services together with high thresholds for accepting service users and long waiting lists As we did with SARCs we explored survivors experiences of harm and benefit in different sectors post SARC The findings from the voluntary sector services replicated what we found for SARC a median of suggesting that half of the people rated maximum benefit scores across a rich landscape of support provision for survivors The median score for the NHS was with a notably higher proportion of survivors indicating that they experienced a harmful response from the NHS Coping and recovery for survivors occur in a justice context and while this study captures widespread evidence of positive action police and justice lagged considerably behind in its harm benefit profile While of participants indicated benefit scores more than a quarter of the sample indicated they derived harm from their interactions and experiences The whole investigation process has been just as traumatic as the abuse or in another way worse While health care and other support services have come a long way towards providing safe effective and compassionate care for survivors society continues to grapple with its poor performance in meeting justice needs While an in depth discussion of findings on these aspects is beyond the scope of this research the next section distils some of the key findings on the factors influencing recovery Effectiveness of SARC pathways for survivors of sexual violence and abuse Central to our endeavour was to understand what impinges on outcomes for survivors There were many outcomes assessed in the cohort study here we summarise the quantitative evidence for a reduction in trauma symptoms PTSD based PCL as our primary outcome complemented by survivors voices on recovery journeys People entered the cohort study with a high trauma load scored above the diagnostic threshold for PTSD There was strong evidence of associations between PTSD at baseline and past trauma burden e g ACEs health profiles chronic mental health problems and socioeconomic factors e g economic deprivation The study also found weak evidence that sexual violence perpetrated by partners family members and people in positions of trust aggravated PTSD and there was a small effect of time since trauma more time to SARC more trauma detected at baseline At year the sample as a whole had achieved a MCID mean reduction in points SD however were still above the diagnostic threshold There was no evidence for differences in PTSD at year related to models of SARC service delivery participants had accessed i e charity police NHS private sector provision Cost utility analyses also identified no significant difference in cost per QALY gained between these different models of SARC service delivery Similarly we did not detect an effect of the ISVA model i e SARC ISVA or non SARC ISVA Although intensity frequency of service use was associated with trauma at baseline we detected no effect of level of service use over the year or did we detect an effect of harm benefit from the police justice response on the PTSD outcome Thus the only predictor for PTSD at year was the baseline burden of PTSD which has been shown to be strongly determined by several well defined pre offence characteristics and to some extent non recent sexual violence and abuse and proximity to the perpetrator Our research also suggests that those with the highest trauma at baseline had the greatest improvement Furthermore while those with four or more ACEs had twice the odds of probable PTSD at baseline t his reduced OR at months and effectively was null OR at year It would be promising if months of care and support could dilute the effect of the ACE profile Showing clear parallels with our study Khadr et al reported based on a study of young survivors that the presence of a psychiatric morbidity months post SARC was associated with baseline psychosocial vulnerability defined as previous social services involvement mental health service NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No use self harm or sexual abuse but not assault characteristics Khadr et al recommended that CYP require comprehensive support to address high levels of pre existing vulnerability and psychological comorbidity and prevent re victimisation Our own CYP study observed that recovery and healing was influenced by how quickly CYP accessed support its content and duration the location and context of care how well services worked together aligning with findings from our process evaluation and CYP s interactions with professionals at SARCs and across sectors Our process evaluation and narrative analysis helped contextualise these quantitative findings On the whole SARCs working with ISVA services is suggested to be an effective gateway to care for survivors I feel that the support I ve had from the ISVA service from SARC has given me a better outlook on life A vast array of other factors interacting at different levels played a role in survivors healing journeys see Figure Some overlapped with access barriers and enablers see Figure Finding therapeutic fit for presenting issues and importantly past or complex traumas and this being available within statutory health services was a gap that arose post SARC Furthermore perceiving that justice had prevailed and holding a belief that the police were thorough respectful communicative and honest about the investigation was important in recovery and healing Effectiveness of SARC pathways for children and young people Our CYP study showed that the holistic care and support provided by SARCs played a critical role in young survivors recovery Their access to support at SARC relied on professionals referring them to SARC once they disclosed the abuse Improvements in young survivors physical and mental health education interpersonal relationships and re engaging in a wide range of areas of their lives was affected by how quickly they accessed support its content and duration the location and context of care CYP s readiness to access support was impacted by factors such as re exposure to abuse living situations or the quality of relationship with a professional This mirrors findings in the context of CYP experiencing domestic abuse where readiness to engage in support involves a complex interplay of individual relational and contextual Prevailing culture and Community Family Survivor society Gender and racial Level of support and Pre existing poor discrimination in responses from mental health processes systems services includng SARCs challenges recovery Responses of friends institutions and wider and family to society thwarts

attribution the title original author s the publication source NIHR Journals Library and the DOI of the publication must be cited DISCUSSION factors Notably when young survivors in this study experienced cohesiveness of support between professionals across and beyond the SARC pathway they had an increased sense of safety Importantly interactions with professionals that lacked a trauma informed approach at any stage of their recovery was associated with poor or delayed healing This supports findings that show how accessing a service in itself does not necessarily improve trauma symptoms Rather it is the quality of services and survivors interactions with professionals that lead to long lasting positive effects Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for survivors of sexual violence and abuse Sexual assault referral centres represent a gateway to pathway of care for survivors that ideally opens up options to various psychosocial interventions These may be accessed through NHS services including Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression programme formerly Improving Access to Psychological Therapies IAPT and community mental health where many of the traditional trauma focused interventions are offered Such therapies are also available in the voluntary sector which additionally offered survivors in our studies a wide range of arts based body based counselling and social interventions There are many examples of people accessing therapies through private routes due to being unable to access support they felt they needed or access that in a timely way Our Cochrane Review synthesising findings from randomised controlled trials from various parts of the world found a large reduction in PTSD symptoms and depression at post treatment following psychosocial interventions compared with controls Our review also suggested that CBT with a trauma focus such as Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing Therapy and other exposure based therapies e g EMDR probably benefit survivors of sexual violence and abuse over non trauma focused intervention However trauma focused interventions may result in higher treatment non completion and some survivors may continue to experience a high symptom load post treatment In response to the limits of trauma focused interventions there have been calls for more effective approaches to the management of PTSD especially for sexual violence and abuse exposure One contribution of our review is the synthesis of several novel treatments across a range of promising new areas such as RTM trauma sensitive or trauma informed yoga Lifespan Integration LI and neurofeedback Some of these treatments have been shown to be effective among survivors of other types of trauma e g RTM while other therapies have scarce evidence in any population Strengths This mixed methods multi study project is the most wide ranging analysis of health and experiences of care among survivors of sexual violence and abuse in the UK to date It adds to the contribution made by Hughes et al on SARC service users mental health and alcohol and drug use needs by examining quality of care and service provision in four sectors over year There is an absence of longitudinal research in the UK investigating the health and well being of survivors over time We undertook recruitment baseline assessments and two follow ups with survivors in the context of NHSE s model for the provision of SAAS in England generating not only an evaluation of SARCs but the entire care pathway Notwithstanding that this subpopulation represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of wider experiences of survivors of sexual violence and abuse in the general population we have demonstrated a safe effective and feasible approach to understanding survivors experiences over time A major contribution of this work lies in our best practice approach to PPI which opens new opportunities for undertaking research with trauma populations An external evaluation by Survivors Voices identified clear evidence of trauma informed practice in the approach of the MESARCH team which enabled and supported survivors to make a vital contribution to the project as both participants and co producers centering lived experience at the heart of the research Key strengths were strong attention to creating a safe environment and demonstrating genuine care for survivor well being built on trustworthy relationships commitment to authentic engagement involving survivors as both participants and co producers which empowered survivors and researchers successful amplification of the voices of survivors bringing the validity and impact of lived experience to trauma abuse and violence research NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Our project contained many other innovative features including the breadth of its methods which enabled people from many different backgrounds to engage with us and participate Further diversity of contributions which extend the relevance of our findings includes our qualitative work with CYP to understand about access to SARC and recovery Our process evaluation gathered views of professionals regarding the work of SARCs across the sector reflecting both inward and onward referral points We also ensured a focus on racially minoritised survivors in our small non SARC community sample and also through the use of maximum variation sampling within our cohort We gathered life narratives from a whole range of minoritised groups including socially disadvantaged people those unable to work and living in insecure housing we spoke to people with complex trauma people with different disabilities physical health conditions as well as including men LGBTQ survivors and linguistically diverse people through interpreters Our Cochrane Review of trials represents the most comprehensive analysis to date on the efficacy of psychotherapies and other psychosocial interventions for survivors of sexual violence and abuse in adulthood Through both professionals and survivors contributions our research showcases the breadth of the crisis response and clinical advocacy police and support work occurs across sectors and the resilience technical skill knowledge and collaboration professionals demonstrate in enabling access to care justice and recovery for their clients and services users Our research has been translated into efforts to prevent violence and abuse and its sequelae for example our whatareyoudoing campaign whatareyoudoing coventry domains With a short film about domestic and sexual abuse in a young couple s relationship as a centrepiece it has received widespread endorsement from survivors practitioners and policy makers Limitations One of the key limitations relates to the composition of our sub study samples which reflects the challenges of conducting research with survivors of sexual violence and abuse While recruiting ISVA third sector services and relying on them to refer survivors to our research for our adult and children s studies was the most optimal approach to us and enabled the research to be conduct safely we do recognise that commitment by site was highly variable Recruitment challenges meant that our adult cohort study sample size had to be re calculated and revisions were made to the study protocol We also acknowledge that our adult cohort study did not have a control group non SARC population for comparison which limits a conclusion that access to SARC and other health or therapeutic care explained the reduction observed in PTSD We could reach participants from a non SARC population in the narrative study These participants provided detailed insight into their experiences of services but the numbers were low Although we captured a large number of survivors beyond medico legal services SARCs through our Cochrane Reviews good support one key limitation of our primary research is the lack of applicability beyond SARC settings and users and it is known that most people who are victims of sexual violence and abuse do not access SARCs The study was delivered through the COVID pandemic and had a number of implications The COVID pandemic impacted the extent to which services were able to commit to supporting the project in its recruitment of service users due to the demands on services and the workforce Furthermore the COVID pandemic changed the landscape of service provision and there were difficulties in disentangling what support participants had actually received from SARCs Importantly we had to adjust the inclusion criteria for the adult cohort study to include remote services use when our intention had been to only recruit those who presented at SARCs in person This will have likely influenced the research in ways we are yet to discover for example it is conceivable remote models diluted potential benefits of the SARC pathway

be cited DISCUSSION As outlined in Chapter we experienced a number of challenges in recruiting to the children s study One of the key limitations is that the voices of young participants from diverse cultural communities of individuals with physical disabilities and of boys and young men were largely missing in this study Furthermore the study only represented two paediatric SARC services and is therefore not representative of the wider youth population accessing SARCs in England There were limitations associated with the data we collected In our process evaluation we were unable to gain depth in respect of forensic integrity and equipment as being beyond the scope and expertise of the team Yet this is recognised as a key issue for the sector and criminal justice journeys An important and novel contribution of our cohort study was to gather comparative data on the experiences of benefit and harm across several sectors We faced challenges in how to best measure perceived harm and benefit of services as part of a telephone interview The approach we used was highly subjective with the parameters being interpreted differently by participants There was a high level of missing data on resource use at all timepoints as the section was often omitted where participants were finding the interview difficult As a result this limited the type of analysis we were able to conduct with a complete case analysis being undertaken By excluding those who did not have complete data in relation to these measures at all timepoints we note that there may be bias in the results Finally we are aware that the month follow up in the present study did not allow longer term impacts to be fully captured in our study We had terminated the month follow up owing to the cost associated with the COVID pandemic and the wider difficulties of recruiting from a trauma population Equality diversity and inclusion In the Cochrane Reviews process evaluation and main cohort study our representation of important population characteristics was restricted to some extent to those included within existing studies employed in sexual assault services and who have accessed SARCs In saying that the studies of the Cochrane Review included global majority and or minoritised survivors of our cohort sample comprised individuals from racially minoritised groups and we had considerable diversity across disability mental health and socioeconomic status We took several steps to expand the reach of our work for example in the representations in our videos and other recruitment materials Because it is known that minoritised groups may be at greater risk of sexual violence and abuse and are under represented in SARCs we conducted our narrative study with intentional recruitment through maximum variation sampling to reach minoritised people including people who have not accessed SARC We worked consistently with our LEG to expand diversity of that group and the participants in the sub studies Our LEG comprised people with a range of ethnic and linguistic backgrounds ages genders and sexual orientations educational level and work backgrounds Recognising the marginalisation and inequalities experienced by survivors of abuse especially survivors of CSA we applied ourselves consistently to growing the skills opportunities and experiences of our LEG colleagues through training development and engagement see Chapter Our research team e g field workers comprised people from a range of different ethnic cultural and linguistic backgrounds bringing a diversity of life experience to the day to day work of the study However we would be more focused on building the survivor leadership of future projects in this field as well as the cultural and ethnic diversity at the leadership level Implications for health care Our findings are strong evidence of good practice at SARCs in England Sexual assault referral centres are a safe effective point of care for survivors of sexual violence and abuse offering a gateway to other SAAS the NHS and police NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No Sexual assault referral centres must recognise the vulnerability affecting their service users lifetime traumas pre existing mental health ill health and social disadvantage which predicted high trauma symptoms in the weeks and months after SARC Survivors with risk factors associated with PTSD warrant tailored support and follow up to ensure they are able to access onward care e g sexual health Early pre offence interventions among vulnerable CYP may be vital to improve safety and reduce risks of sexual violence and abuse exposure We did not detect evidence that models of SARCs and ISVA services differentially affected service user health outcomes Enhancing care and support for survivors comes from sharing best practice and building and maintaining strong alliances with police forces ISVA services and voluntary sector partners health and social care agencies should continuously review and refine local care pathways which include survivor and service user stakeholders Our findings lend strong support for access to ISVAs with specialisms around supporting particularly vulnerable or minoritised groups given the difficulties reported by these subgroups in accessing justice and other support Sexual assault referral centres continue to lack visibility among victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse relative to voluntary sexual violence services and outreach to minoritised groups may improve this Widespread satisfaction among survivors in relation to provision in the voluntary sector with the exception of waiting lists for access to psychological therapies Mainstay psychological therapies for PTSD provide benefits for survivors but do not meet the needs of all survivors Resourcing the voluntary sector further may increase access to alternatives as we found high levels of satisfaction and recovery in response to a range of novel and inexpensive therapies e g require fewer sessions treatments and activities that may lack an established scientific evidence base It is the responsibility of practitioners and therapists to make decisions about treatments appropriate to the circumstances of clients in consultation with them and their families carers or guardians All healthcare settings need to work towards implementing trauma competent practices as we found evidence of inadequate and even harmful responses in primary care and mental health Steps to address health disparities and enhance access to the SARC SAAS care pathway must be designed and delivered within a health inequalities and intersectional framework given the prominence of silencing by perpetrators families communities professionals services institutions and wider society The findings call for cohesive commissioning strategies that recognise the value of partnerships in promoting optimal access and care experiences for survivors Recognising the distinction between PTSD and complex PTSD when considering suitable trauma treatment is important as complex PTSD may be less amenable to trauma focused approaches It underscores the value of a wide range of treatment options and alternatives to frontline therapies Many such alternative treatments could have relevance to clinical and policy decisions because they are often shorter and therefore less costly easier to deliver may be deliverable online are more feasible for survivors to access and scalable Recommendations for research The main research recommendation arising from the Cochrane Reviews which is supported by the primary qualitative findings is to build the evidence base for a variety of novel and not necessarily trauma focused and potentially cost effective e g shorter delivery computer based or online treatments and therapies thereby expanding options for people to heal after abuse We advocate that all and any future research with adult and child survivors of sexual violence and abuse in any context is conducted in line with principles and methods required for trauma informed research

literature on HRQoL and resource use in a sexual violence and abuse population Additional research is needed to compare the costs of pathways and PTSD burden among those who access SARC with survivors who do not Further research needs to distil what trauma informed practice looks like across sectors and develop models of translation Concluding remarks This mixed methods multi workstream programme of research capturing the data of participants from a diverse range of backgrounds across its reviews screening service level data and primary research represents the most substantive investigation to date into the health and well being and recovery experiences of survivors of sexual violence and abuse It provides clear evidence of the positive impact of SARCs in England in terms of support and aftercare provided to survivors There is also clear evidence that ISVA and third sector support is beneficial for the vast majority of survivors and that good inter agency collaboration contributes to effective care and support provided There is more work to do however to improve the response of some NHS services and of the response provided by police where they are involved There is room for improvement in the time taken for survivors to access therapeutic treatment and support and for the range of available types of support and treatment to be increased There are also clear gaps in the provision of support for people who have experienced complex trauma and who may experience additional barriers to accessing treatment and support due to membership of one or more marginalised groups More tailored culturally competent outreach and service provision is required to help address health disparities related to experience of sexual and domestic violence Action is also required to continue to improve cultural and societal norms that support and perpetuate sexual violence and abuse and create a challenging context within which survivors must work to recover The findings of this

desire to discover whether what they planned to do and how they planned to do it held real authenticity within the LEG The way in which they made the group feel at ease and respected when asking for LEG help and advice empowered the LEG members to speak with a freedom of opinion and allowed them to speak about their traumatic experiences openly in the hope that finally someone wanted to listen and not just hear but take what they were saying and use their responses in a practical way that could go on to help others who are in the same situation This working together empowered LEG members to participate using their real selves and live voices in the making of film social media and marketing campaigns and finally meeting delegates and presenting and speaking up and out at the final conference When you find your freedom of voice as a survivor you are anxious to try and help the next person in your situation As a result of the stigma of sexual abuse and rape rarely do we as a group speak out for fear of shame and lack of self worth Rarely are we listened to and valued instead we are usually pitied or not believed Never do we find ourselves in a position where the experience of sexual abuse renders us the expert when in fact we are Personally participating in this research study improved my mental health and personal confidence It has allowed me to articulate difficult feelings that I would not normally bring to anyone s attention with calm measured behaviour resulting in positive outcomes Working with the project I have experienced the biggest forward jump in my well being and recovery because I sought professional help in my darkest days It has been on both sides a time of respect education empowerment joy and laughter LEG groups should be

Simran s narrative contains details that some people may find upsetting Before I was so happy I will go to this country I will make my daughter s future By three months I was like a slave my husband telling my daughter she needs to do household chores she can t study They cut the Wi Fi so she couldn t access any of the course online or anything My daughter had a really really rough time My daughter was trying to study because she was in GCSEs She was trying to study but she couldn t understand anything because of the environment she had at home all the time fighting I was so worried about my mental health If I have something happen to me what will happen to my daughter One day my daughter wanted to get a haircut done but she wasn t allowed so my husband told her off and then we had a big argument It was during lockdown We left home and we didn t know where we will go We were very scared We had nothing We were wearing simple things We had limited money Me and my daughter went to the police station I didn t know what to say because my English was limited My daughter started We came from India and police said That thing happens with the Indian families it s not a new thing So they sat with us minutes and they said You go home The day we left for good I had an appointment at the police station for o clock They were waiting for interpreters because I can t speak in English very well so we waited for a translator until o clock The translator didn t come but they had a three way translation for me My husband came back home he didn t find us and he rang when we were in the police station and we were so scared about what he can do They asked questions but I can t remember what the questions were I was told You will need to go home I said I can t go back home I will be in danger but they asked When you will go home No one will tell you anything just go home They gave me a domestic violence number They told me I had to make my own way There was no bed space in the refuge We went to a hotel I was crying the whole two days I was feeling like panic attack type things and I couldn t answer any phones My daughter was answering all the phones I didn t know what was happening to me I was so confused because I didn t know where to go and my daughter was telling me Don t cry don t cry My daughter was giving me comfort We paid two days with our money but on the third we were asked to check out We stayed in the hotel reception five hours until the social worker came and paid for more days It was hard because the social worker used to force us Look you have money pay your money All I had in total was My daughter had GCSE exams She had no phone and I was thinking I would buy a phone for her from the Afterwards the social worker took us to the refuge We were given for a week and we used it to get all shopping done I had nothing in the kitchen Nothing I could make because the house wasn t Indian We got food from food bank and it was some kind of Indian food and drink We stayed in a flat and people used to knock on our door and my daughter used to be scared We used to get so scared that flashbacks started coming and there wasn t any lock controlled by us there s only one they control and we used to think anyone can come and we didn t sleep at all both me and my daughter I started going to one of the support groups but that group closed I was isolated again and me and my daughter were so isolated fearful I didn t know what will happen to my daughter I was more worried about my daughter I didn t know a doctor and I never went to any temple I didn t know how to go After three months they provided us with a house and then we slept well The SV charity involved an ISVA and a DV agency I needed a letter for my visa because I was on a sponsored visa The ISVA called the police a couple times and then the police gave the letter After months police approached me they were asking whether I want to give a statement My mental health wasn t good and I didn t want to go back to the experience I had gone through with the police I didn t want to give that statement at that moment I am happy with the house but I received a letter that I have to leave the building in April and now again I m feeling Where I will go again I m very confused and I am still scared of police When I was in India I never went to police never had anything to do with police and here I still have fear of police I have fear of my English is not very good if I say anything and it was interpreted in a different way I m so fearful I won t say anyone to go to police I am on the waiting list for counselling I don t realise what happens to me but my daughter says I am alert I don t feel like going anywhere I don t feel like doing anything My

tell If she goes back home to India she might tell someone and the whole village might know I don t want shame brought to the family Because of this notice to leave my house I couldn t sleep and I went to the GP I told them I can t sleep and the GP asked why and then I told my situation My house I will be homeless The GP involved someone I felt very supported when this lady from the doctor when she rang me and she told if you tell this thing to the support worker and so I told support worker and then they extended me days more So I felt supported at that time My daughter is saying now at least we have the school holidays so you know the transfer won t affect her studies But if we had to go in June it will be A levels I still prefer if the GP was a female because I can tell more and she can understand more than males and I prefer to speak Hindi BOX Fay s narrative contains details that some people may find upsetting I Incident and impact Where do I start After the incident that happened to me I was in shock for days I just couldn t believe that it had happened How it all came about was this the person who was in my shared house actually moved to that shared house so they weren t that far from me I started looking after her as well because her partner was in and out of prison and she was cutting herself and I was giving her support patching her up at the same time I think it s easier to find someone else to look after rather than trying to sort your own problems out The bloke who done it to me I met him in that house The chap who did it to me he was an actual heroin addict but I didn t know this at the time I didn t know how bad he was We all got talking and the next time I came down she wasn t in but this chap was so then after my friend left when the young girl left the house they turned around and said Oh you re still welcome to come down it d be good to see you you re very good to talk to and you listen as well I was like a shoulder to cry on I suppose But I think one of them just took it a little bit too far thought that I wanted a relationship and things like that which I didn t It s like any bloke that I do meet what I ve been saying is I don t want a relationship I do not want to go down that road again I didn t really get in touch with anybody for days I did eventually call the police and they came and took a statement as to what had happened I saw them nearly half o clock Then they said that somebody will be picking me up at o clock to take me to this clinic I was taken to SARC where I had to have all the forensic swabs done and all the rest of that That was a little bit daunting I was in too much pain I hadn t even showered I thought well if I don t shower then at least that way they ve still got evidence When I asked them What happens now all they said was Oh well he s in prison we ve got him in custody and we ve got him on remand and he s denying it All the tests show is that you had sex and I said Yes non consensual sex because I didn t want it I was forced so that s rape I then had an appointment at the sexual health clinic Then I had another swab taken well they tried to I was explaining that I m really really sore but it feels sore further up like internal pain or like internal bruising if that s what you call it And then I had to have the Hep Hepatitis C Hep Hepatitis B injections and I had another blood test as well I should have had a follow up last June but never got a follow up phone call to say Please can you come in so I ve not had a follow up from that I then had to move out the police asked me where would you like to move because we were both living on the same street Why should I leave It did not make sense I had to move again The police said about doing another statement by video link I said Yeah I m quite happy to do that That was the only time it was mentioned I was waiting for that to happen and they turned around and said I had refused it I thought to myself well how can I have refused it if I said yes to it I think they re trying to brush it under the carpet as if it didn t happen or put the file back in the box and put it back on the shelf it s as if they just didn t want to do the paperwork They were going to give me an ISVA but no nothing happened They said that they had to close it because there was not enough and I m thinking Excuse me I had bruises on my legs I ve taken photos of the bruises I ve been in pain since it happened with my hips lower back with my thighs I ve had a lot of nerve pain and bone and joint pain on both hips It has impacted my life because I can t walk as far as I used to I have to stop and start walking again It s just really really impacted on my life in that way It was just horrible it really was I didn t know what to do next I didn t know who to ring there was not even a victim support officer where I could actually go and speak to someone Even my mental health doctor consultant has actually sent me back like discharged me and sent me back to my own GP The GP can only do so much Alright yes they ve done a brief letter I did get a nice letter done from the doctors from where it NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No happened They re really good and that helped me to get moved out of that property into the property that I m in now I ve asked for another letter to be done and I had to pay for the letter as well I then sent that off to the housing association II Recovery I literally can t live my life at all I ve literally had no support and it s impacted my mental health as well and my well being and I just can t seem to how can I explain it move forward It s still all in my head and I just can t get my head around it Well basically I can t even get closure on it Nobody s telling me what s happened whether he has been deported or whether he s still in the UK It feels like I m always looking over my shoulder The recovery s been really slow I have been trying to be more positive to try and get back to the place where I can feel comfortable and sometimes I m not very comfortable around men I think once I get this move then I think I might start feeling myself again be closer to my family they re looking for me for somewhere I want to get back into my volunteering I m still on the books at charity organisation because I d been helping out in like a contact centre I left that area because of what happened with my husband it was like verbal abuse emotional abuse and sexual abuse as well I had to leave I just couldn t cope anymore my mental health was going through the roof I think the older you are the more difficult it is because I feel that maybe some people are like Oh nobody s going listen to me I m not worth nothing I m not worth the bother Do you know what I mean I feel that as you get older you do find things a lot harder to even register what s happened Sometimes you don t know where to look you don t know who s going be your first point of call to call someone because you re that shocked that it s actually happened in the first place BOX Jane s narrative contains details that some people may find upsetting I didn t report for five days after the assault and then I ended up calling and they said You need to speak to a SARC They gave me the number of the SARC and I rang them and they were really really good We had a conversation and they called me back There was a forensic examiner on the phone and a crisis worker They went through what had happened I said I ve got mental health They said We re not judging on your mental health it s got nothing to do with that They arranged for me to go in quite quickly So I had a forensic examination which was obviously really hard work but they were very supportive A few days later I did get the police involved and I feel now that was a mistake Two very young officers came to my flat in the evening which I thought was inappropriate I wasn t offered female officers I think as soon as I told them I ve got mental health issues it their attitude changed towards me They said Well if this does go to court yeah your records your mental health records will be shown to the courts Those two police officers they never ever looked at the photographs from the SARC They never looked at any of those things I felt they had an agenda after they saw me they did find the guy that assaulted me but they basically just gave him a telling off that was what I felt They just disregarded what I had to say We ISVA and survivor did a decision review with the police because we felt the original decision wasn t appropriate I got video recorded later down the line which really upset me because I couldn t remember some of the stuff from the assault I felt that one of the female officers was very judgmental She asked me questions about my previous sexual experiences which I refused to answer because it s none of her business We had some information back from the sergeant who was looking into the investigation He made out that if it had been slightly worse maybe But how can you rate an injury I had you know internal bruising as bad or worse That just really made me angry We could have met with him afterwards and I was like Not a chance I ve had enough of the police if you see what I mean I was just like No it s not going to help me Do you know what I mean So I was like No I have a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder and that at times that was used as a bit like a weapon or that was a barrier for me to access certain support I felt it was used in a sort of negative way The SARC referred me for counselling services but when I said that I had complex mental health the woman counsellor said Well we only really deal with people with anxiety and depression She started to obsess about my mental health when I started sessions with her on the phone I said Actually I m not here to talk about mental health it s to do with the sexual assault It was as if you couldn t actually access that service if you had a complex mental health diagnosis and in the end I stopped it because I felt it was making it more detrimental I don t have any support from mental health services at all now So they just say If things get really bad you ve got to go to A and E But A and E s not the best place I ve been there before for a mental health crisis and it s not helpful Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health

it to go to court if it can if they ve got enough evidence Obviously this happened years ago when I was between and I ve buried it for such a long time I still feel really angry about it There s no way to describe the anger I feel that he took away part of my soul and heart He took my childhood away Obviously speaking to the police brought everything back up My parents didn t want to know when I spoke to them about it I grew up in the age of where everything was hidden So I kept this totally from everybody until I heard that he was put in prison that gave me the courage to come forward That s how this process started II Support I feel in a very good place at this moment in time I feel that the support I ve had from different organisations has been really helpful Listening and tried to explain to me that I wasn t at fault My mechanism before to shut everything out I ve still got that sort of mechanism But I can bring things up now without really being upset about it I feel the police have been really helpful The lady that s been dealing with the case has been really helpful in the sense of explaining everything Having gone to the police when I did it has released so much pressure from me in the sense of letting people in The only thing I feel probably that everybody else in my situation feels it takes longer than you anticipate The process of the police talking to suspects It s not the police s fault It s just the way the system works I was probably a bit na\u00efve in the sense of thinking once I d made a statement everything else would have fallen in place a lot quicker Saying that I feel that the support I ve had from ISVA service from SARC has given me a better outlook on life With the help that I ve been having through the different organisations it s helped me tremendously and knowing that they re there III Reactions from family friends and society today Years ago when I was talking about it it wasn t heard I wasn t heard Looking back over the last couple of years of going through the process it seems to be that it s only been brought to light in the sense of more people are being listened to So I feel in that representation we are being heard a lot more and taken seriously which I have never felt before It has been a lot more open It s more accessible You re not afraid to talk about it I feel that I ve got to a better place now where I feel that if I need to talk to somebody say friends for instance or work colleagues even I m not ashamed I m not ashamed to talk about it I ve been very fortunate with my work They ve been really good and helpful I feel that without them it would have been a lot more difficult With everybody being on board it has been a lot better HR has been really good So s my son and my best mate He s been an absolute rock as well W hat gets me really upset at times is if I m watching television and abuse comes on the television without without any warning For instance when they were talking about Prince Andrew and then when they say things there are television programmes that it s actually got the subject in that perhaps I didn t realise that it had Then I start watching it Then it comes on Or they show perhaps something s happened again in the wider world Then I feel really feel really bad IV Recovery I feel that the police are doing all that they can So I feel that he s not actually controlling now Because they ve got to do everything the right way So I feel knowing that the system is being used correctly that I know that if and when things do process forward I know that everything has been dealt with properly So I feel a lot happier I feel anxious I don t feel depressed with it I feel uptight because obviously it s taken a lot longer than I anticipated But by coming forward as well it s helping not only myself but if I could help somebody else in the process then I feel it s all been worthwhile as well Because there is a lot of us out there that s not either come forward or hasn t been heard I just get a bit upset Not to the point where I m crying anymore Not at the moment Perhaps when the case goes forward might feel differently Although I want the case to go forward nobody knows how you re going to react So yes and obviously when he used to trap He trapped me in the shower when we were on holiday as well I feel that all those things they re still in the back of my mind but it s come into the open people know about it and gradually people have a better understanding of my personality My best mate said to me the other day that he understands now why sometimes I was the way I was in the NIHR Journals Library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk DOI CTGF Health and Social Care Delivery Research Vol No sense of my moods and shying away I ve known Peter since the age of years and we ve grown up together We re best of mates I ve let him down loads of times and it s because sometimes I feel like I haven t been able to get it out of my mind I ve kept it a secret for such a long time I am coping with it now a lot better than I have done for a very long time I m sorting my life out I d run the London Marathon back in for Childline I kept my running vest and it s only now that I got it out I ve taken it to a shop and I ve had it framed so that I can put it on the wall I ve got to that stage now where I can face it I feel a lot freer than I have done for a long time I m in a really good place in the sense that I know everybody is playing a part Everybody s working behind the scenes So it s up to me in the sense of having the help and understanding how I feel and how to deal with it Rather than locking it all away and not telling anybody That s given me the strength knowing that people are out there helping me And listening to me Whereas before nobody was listening I know now that people are listening and that s given me the courage to fight this in a different way mentally I m starting a course with voluntary sector organisation I still feel I want to talk about it I still feel I need to talk about it I did say to the police when I was being interviewed I thought I would take this to the grave with nobody knowing And now I can take it to my grave knowing that people know the whole family knows and I m happy about that Once the due process has been gone through whether it does or it doesn t go to court no matter what the outcome is then I can really draw a line under it I can feel free for the rest of my life Copyright O Doherty et al This work was produced by O Doherty et al under the terms of a

University of the Sunshine Coast Australia University of the West of England United Kingdom Lorna O Doherty Coventry University United Kingdom Abstract We examined the impact of Covid on service delivery within specialist sexual violence services and the healing journeys of survivors of sexual violence and abuse through the experiences of professionals and service users in England The pandemic posed challenges across all sectors and economies across the globe but practices and innovations that emerged at that time could enhance future services and user experiences Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes Corresponding author Emma Sleath School of Criminology Sociology and Social Policy University of Leicester Astley Clarke Building University Road Leicester LE RH United Kingdom Email emma sleath leicester ac uk International Review of Victimology within the data Overall the negative impacts of Covid outweighed the positive changes survivors reported increased feelings of depression anxiety and worry exacerbated by isolation and lost connections with friends and family and access to strategies for managing their mental health Difficulties delays in accessing support service provision and disruptions to rapport trust and safety were widespread in participants reports Conversely for some requirements to remain at home provided safety from the world and space for healing and even prompted survivors of non recent abuse to seek help Remote service delivery was beneficial where clients could be at a distance in discussing sensitive issues Together with insights from professionals about their own isolation blurred boundaries and concerns regarding client confidentiality and engagement this research highlights an agile sector responding to an unprecedented situation Moving forward survivors preferences for flexible remote support must be integrated into everyday delivery Keywords COVID pandemic sexual violence telehealth video conferencing depression Introduction Sexual violence continues to represent a significant global public health issue of which the sub stantial lifelong negative physical mental health and social impacts have long been recognised World Health Organization WHO Support and a range of interventions for victims and survivors in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse can be effective in reducing post traumatic stress disorder and symptoms of depression and anxiety O Doherty et al ena bling victims and survivors to re engage with many aspects of their lives Brown et al Despite this victims and survivors often struggle to access appropriate support and interventions throughout their lives Brown et al Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse with agencies and services that are over stretched and under resourced e g Rape Crisis Furthermore inadequate responses to sexual violence are pervasive across legal systems For example in England and Wales there have been significant declines in the charging of rape cases prosecutions and convictions HM Government Consequently victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse have little confidence in what formal responses they might receive e g in supporting a police investigation Molina and Poppleton O Doherty et al How victims and survivors are treated by professionals in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse can influence their psychological recovery Ullman and Peter Hagene Experiences of insensi tive treatment often lead to feelings of powerlessness shame and guilt Campbell and the long duration of criminal proceedings and lack of victims and survivors voices and perspectives in legal proceedings can exacerbate physical social and mental health struggles O Doherty et al These challenges are echoed internationally with a consensus that change is needed on a global level e g Sentencing Advisory Council This background is the setting for the cur rent study in providing an original investigation of the cumulative impacts that the global pan demic of COVID had on victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse and on those working within settings that provide support to them There were three lockdown periods in England between and It is now well recognised that lockdown periods both nationally and internationally resulted in increases in the incidence of domestic abuse and escalated the risk to those already subjected to abuse e g Kourti et al Sleath et al Office for National Statistics Described by some as a pandemic within a pandemic Johnson et al sexual violence received fewer media attention at the time than domestic violence but given that most rapes are perpetrated by individuals known to victims and occur in the victims or perpetrators homes Office for National Statistics it was recognised that it was perpetrated alongside domestic abuse Early in the pandemic research highlighted the challenges faced by victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse After the first lockdown in summer Almeida reported on the perspectives of frontline Victim Support an agency that supports victims of any crime in England and Wales staff on victims and survivors access to services Staff said that victims of crime experienced increased barriers to accessing both government agencies and non government services for multiple reasons including a perception that services were not open services being overwhelmed and unable to meet needs and clients not wishing or being unable e g due to digital poverty to use non traditional methods of engaging with services In addition service providers highlighted increased isolation for survivors Michaelsen et al and that changes in modes of service delivery were perceived to hinder effective communication and rapport between clients and staff Montesanti et al Overall staff depicted a bleak outlook of the potential impact on survivors perceiving these changes as significantly diminishing clients capacity for healing especially for sexual violence victims and survivors and magnified among the most vulnerable The Survivors Trust Given that delayed disclosure help seeking and or intervention often necessitate more intensive support concerns about long term outcomes for survivors were not unfounded Bicanic et al Ruggiero et al While services initially experienced reductions in service use Muldoon et al these quickly returned to usual or increased levels Majeed Ariss et al alongside greater propor tions of vulnerable clients who had experienced more severe abuse during the pandemic seeking support Almeida Schrag et al The services themselves experienced considerable upheaval as they sought to provide services in line with COVID safety protocols The Survivors Trust an agency that represents sexual violence and abuse services in the United Kingdom and Ireland surveyed their members in November and found that of staff reported that work issues were invading home life and just more than reported concerns about teams feeling less cohesive Gunby et al s discussion paper about the implications of changes in service delivery highlighted the potential for lost distinctions between the home and the workplace and removing the emotional and physical distance so vital in this context between work and home life see also Wood et al The changes in service delivery specifically the shift to remote services i e telephone or online were not necessarily negative Pre pandemic sexual violence researchers were already evaluating different interventions using different modalities see O Doherty et al with some research suggesting it may be preferable to offer remote care in some circumstances for example to avoid traumatic triggers in clinical settings In relation to military sexual trauma Acierno et al compared home based telemedicine with in person care and found no differ ences in the efficacy of trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy CBT However Smith et al pointed out that this research was in its infancy noting the lack of systematic research into clients perspectives on remote methods of delivering psychotherapy Specifically they argued that it was important to explore this in the context of the pandemic where online and telephone support was largely imposed by circumstance rather than by client choice Brown et al s qualitative synthesis of the experiences of psychosocial interventions for sexual violence found International Review of Victimology that the format and delivery of an intervention could impact individuals experiences One study in that review identified the difficulties of delivering trauma focused CBT to child survivors during the pandemic when parents and children wanted to meet in person Polk The review high lighted the importance of managing expectations about interventions including preparing victims and survivors and carers for receiving virtual interventions Hence while some knowledge exists in relation to the delivery of remote care there remain many questions not least in capturing a wider breadth of perspectives and experiences of professionals victims and survivors Storer and Nyerges The current study Synthesising the perspectives and experiences of professionals victims and survivors during the height of the pandemic makes a vital contribution to understanding how practice and support can be shaped for the future Learning from such instances will ensure that responses to survivors are resilient to future events and will also harness the best practices implemented during these times in order to identify innovations and strengthen responses overall Johnson et al Roesch et al The majority of the survivor centred research has focused on domestic intimate partner violence e g Mazza et al or contained the perspectives of a limited number of profession als e g Bennett et al Janse van Rensburg and Smith Prior research regarding vic tims and survivors perspectives has been only drawn from professionals providing their views of victims and survivors challenges e g Elliott et al Michaelsen et al Research that did involve survivors is limited to quantitative data and involved assessments of forms of help seeking during the pandemic for example Sorenson et al s assessment of calls No research has documented the voices of victims and survivors of sexual violence in real time i e during the pandemic Furthermore this research draws on professionals perspectives regarding the impacts of the pandemic and experiences of service delivery across multiple settings and organ isations in England extending the value of this work This original research explores the views of those who worked in sexual assault referral centres SARCs i e medico legal settings those who worked at a strategic commissioning level of the sexual violence services non governmental agen cies i e the voluntary sector and the police regarding the changes brought about by the pan demic These organisations represent the key supporting organisations and those who shaped those services for victims and survivors in their help seeking and subsequent recovery journeys This research employs an ecological model to organise the examination of the impact of Covid on victims and survivors healing and recovery journeys and service delivery in sexual violence and abuse services This framework has previously been applied to service utilisation and health outcomes as it supports understanding the complex and interconnecting factors that can have a cumulative effect on health Golden and Earp In applying this theory to the experiences of victims survivors and professionals the findings from this study will articulate factors that influ ence survivor recovery across microsystems mesosystems exosystems macrosystems and chron osystems Chynoweth et al Stockman et al Microsystems refer to the survivor s immediate environment and interactions such as interactions with support services and their immediate personal support network Mesosystems relate to connections between components of the microsystem such as communication between agencies that work with victims and survivors and also service delivery For example in the context of this current research changes in modes of service delivery during the pandemic may reduce effective rapport between staff and clients Sleath et al therefore impacting on clients ability to cope and recover Campbell et al with research at this level sparse Zinzow et al The exosystem level is quite removed from the daily experi ences of service users but as Dworkin and Weaver point out this does not mean policies procedures and practices at that level cannot influence people s experiences For example policies and blanket messaging about locking down communities and nations may have led victims and survivors to perceive that services were simply unavailable The impact of the pandemic is cap tured at the macrosystem level in the form of an environmental stressor with researchers now defining the pandemic as a form of sociocultural level trauma e g Bridgland et al The final level to consider is chronosystem factors which encapsulate changes that occur over time In all the use of this model is extremely effective in capturing the complex interplay between indi viduals systems processes and culture as well as changes over time an approach that has been previously identified as an important focus of future research e g Campbell et al Zinzow et al Furthermore using this model has also been highlighted as an effective approach to generating important recommendations for future practice Eriksson et al Within this organising model Herman s theory for trauma recovery is applied to contex tualise the findings in relation to how they may affect survivor recovery see Campbell et al This theory identifies three stages of trauma recovery safety remembrance and mourning and reconnection Its use in framing the findings will seek to understand how this pathway while rarely linear was affected particularly when the trauma could have been additionally layered with the experiences of the pandemic At the first stage of recovery safety is re established across physi cal safety emotional safety and developing coping mechanisms Remembrance and mourning involve the narrative of the trauma recalling and mourning the trauma experience and confronting and processing trauma in supportive environments Finally reconnection involves creating a future for the survivor reclaiming their empowerment and reconnecting with themselves relationships and communities Herman This research provides a unique triangulation of perspectives from victims survivors and pro fessionals across a range of agencies that supported them during the pandemic The research questions were How did the pandemic impact on survivors of sexual violence and abuse and their help seeking and recovery journeys What were the impacts of the pandemic on service delivery and staff in sexual violence and abuse services and what challenges and opportunities arose Method Design This study was developed as part of a longitudinal study into the health and well being of survivors post SARC Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Sexual Assault Referral Centres for better Health MESARCH O Doherty et al in press carried out between and This qualitative

baseline and months that explored the impact of COVID with only the responses to this question being presented here This generated responses on how COVID had impacted people s recovery journeys including access to and engagement with services and whether there had been any other effects such as self care in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse For the professional sample additional questions were added to the original interview schedule that explored the impact of Covid in relation to changes to services the use of new approaches technologies and the per ceived impacts on clients and themselves Procedure Ethical approval was granted by the project lead universities ethics committees and amend ments to the methods of the main study precipitated by the pandemic were approved by the Health Research Authority IRAS Project ID a requirement for research that involves participants recruited through the National Health Service in England Participants interviewed between April the first lockdown started in March and June were asked about the impact of Covid Professionals were invited from out of approximately SARC sites across England that had agreed to be involved in the larger project Professionals from agencies involved in referring people to SARCs e g the police and providing post SARC care to service users e g advocates counsellors were also recruited In recruiting professionals potential participants were contacted by the lead author with information about the study to determine if they wished to participate in an interview Interviews with professionals were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim Transcripts were quality checked for accuracy and pseudonymised prior to analysis Service users who had been to SARCs were made aware of the larger project by sexual violence advocates termed Independent Sexual Violence Advisors in England trained in the project s research process They used an introductory video developed by the research team and the lived experience group For service users interested in hearing more about the study advocates gathered information on their preferences for contact and interview e g gender of interviewer and details to ensure their safety e g a phrase to let the research team know it was not a safe time to commu nicate The research team then contacted service users and provided a participant information sheet and the opportunity to ask any questions Participants were asked to agree to a set of consent statements Interviews were then carried out by telephone and in line with the project s safety pro tocol Each participant s response to the open ended question about the impact of COVID was documented verbatim International Review of Victimology Data analysis Terry et al s analytic process to thematic analysis was followed for the analysis of the data This approach advocates a Big Q approach to thematic analysis that is positioned within a qualitative paradigm of analysis The analysis was underpinned by a critical realist approach where reality exists that can be partially accessed through research and knowledge can be produced that can implement change Braun and Clarke An inductive analysis was undertaken focused on being led by the data with a primarily semantic approach to coding in which codes and subsequent themes represent the explicit meaning of the data Terry et al The analysis began with familiarisation and code generation with a subsequent process of theme development This involved examining the codes for patterns and clustering resulting in the drawing together of codes into a provisional thematic map The initial thematic structure was developed by the second author then reviewed and refined by the first author and then re checked again by the other authors Discussions were held to assess any changes to the thematic structure and to re check the fit with the data Through this process a final thematic struc ture was developed This ensured that the analysis was quality checked that the final themes were distinct and closely aligned with the data and reflected a fit with the research questions Results Two thematic diagrams Figure addresses the first research question and Figure addresses the second were developed to display the themes generated Themes that are numbered and are in bold text on the diagrams represent the dominant areas that are explored in detail below Impacts of Covid on victims and survivors recovery journeys and help seeking Victims and survivors emphasised several primary problems in relation to how Covid hindered or had a negative impact on their well being and help seeking Increased feelings of depression anxi ety or worry Feelings of isolation or coping alone Reduced informal support e g from family friends or co workers and Reduced access to helpful activities or coping strategies Victims and survivors spoke about how COVID intensified or exacerbated their struggles with feelings of depression anxiety and worry e g it made my anxiety and depression a lot worse I have felt really low not sleeping and suicidal S year These feelings coincided with other worries for some survivors The abuse happened and then a few months later Covid happened I felt anxious and wor ried about health and making ends meet I would say I was depressed a lot S months They also spoke about being alone e g I was stuck here a lot on my own S year and a lack of contact and interaction with others I reported to the ISVA service and the police and then we went into lock down So I went into a meltdown facing all of that by myself I lived alone and was so isolated I felt I was crumbling S baseline In terms of help seeking victims and survivors often referred to hav ing reduced informal support There were frequent references to not being able to see friends and fam ily who were considered key sources of support which affected emotional well being or mental health Normally when I m in a low mood I would surround myself with people who would bring me up again and just spend time with them but I couldn t do that during the first lockdown so I found it difficult to not have that regular contact S baseline Sleath et al Figure Themes relating to the impact of Covid on survivors well being Figure Themes relating to the impact of Covid on service delivery International Review of Victimology Victims and survivors sense of isolation in the aftermath of violence and abuse coincided with increased feelings of depression anxiety and worry Victims and survivors also experienced Reduced access to helpful activities or coping strate gies exercise was one of these with the closure of gyms during lockdown periods being keenly felt e g Things that I have in place like going to the gym have been taken away S months along with other physical activities One of the things I love is dance it s part of my therapy it s been difficult not being able to access dance classes It s part of me it really lights me up S baseline Victims and survivors spoke about their recovery journeys slowing down becoming more dif ficult e g it has been a lot harder trying to work through my issues in lockdown S baseline or being disrupted or going backwards e g I feel like I ve gone backwards after I ve worked so hard for things to get things to normal S months While this isolation and loss of interaction was experienced negatively by most just over a fifth of survivors perceived benefits to the national lockdown focusing on feeling protected by staying at home or having fewer interactions with people and this period being considered a time for heal ing or reflection or having Increased opportunities to spend time with or have contact with family and friends These participants found that the COVID restrictions meant that they could avoid the challenges or anxieties associated with being away from home It has also helped that I am not expected to go out of the house I am nervous about leaving the house I don t want to leave in that respect it is more sensible to stay at home so I have an excuse S baseline Some victims and survivors felt that COVID enabled them to have time for healing or reflection due to having more time available and fewer everyday pressures Yes it definitely has and I would say very very surprisingly I think it has actually given me a lot of opportunities and the ability to do the healing process properly S baseline Furthermore this group of survivors perceived that they benefitted from the pandemic in having increased opportunities to spend time with or have contact with family and friends This particu larly focused on the increased availability of people and accessibility through digital methods I can talk to friends online it s been very easy for me to contact people because they ve always being at home S year These findings represent the critical interactions between different levels of the ecological model whereby the implementation of a national lockdown at the exosystem level primarily has a negative impact at the microsystem level for survivors in reducing their interactions with their social network and increasing isolation However these data also capture the recognisably smaller proportion of participants for whom these changes at the exosystem system represented positive influences on their microsystem with greater time to access their social network and time for heal ing and reflection Impacts of COVID on service delivery Integrating professional and victims and survivor voices impacts on service delivery coalesced around the following changes in service delivery impact of Covid control measures availability and access to support services delivering care and support online or by telephone and negative impacts on staff due to changes in service delivery Sleath et al Changes in service delivery Participants spoke about how service delivery changed with the advent of Covid representing the mesosystem level of the ecological model with emphasis on the shift to approaches that reduced face to face contact Professionals who worked in SARCs focused their discussions on the use of self swabbing and triaging of clients before attending the site as policies and procedures exosystem that were directly introduced to address the advent of the pandemic As part of this discussion professionals shared how they determined the appropriateness of remote care to meet the needs of different clients highlighting how service delivery mesosystem was influenced by exosystem elements If the client has had any needs or disabilities or felt that it wouldn t be in the client s best interests to offer that remote over the phone assessment then I d be advised of that on that initial call from private forensic services booking service in which case I d obviously close down whatever I m doing this side go across and get changed and ready into sort of full PPE Personal Protective Equipment to meet that client Crisis Worker Impact of Covid control measures Both professionals and victims survivors highlighted the spe cific impact that COVID safety policies and procedures had on service delivery Professionals discussed the wearing of Personal Protective Equipment whereas victims and survivors talked about restrictions for example they were not permitted to take a supporter with them to appoint ments Overarching this was the view that Covid measures obstructed interactions between victims and survivors and professionals Professionals from SARCs particularly highlighted the triaging of clients discussed earlier as having an impact on the rapport and support that they could provide to clients And you just think wow because if you re going in to have such an intimate examination for a disclosure of a sexual assault and you ve spoken to people over the phone about your most private kind of personal information then you come in and we re all goggled up masked up gloves and aprons and stuff and then you re swabbed in and out within minutes to half an hour And yeah you just feel so wrong Crisis Worker These impacts were specifically highlighted in relation to children we have to wear PPE for every examination which I think for children can be quite scary and obviously you can t build that same relationship with them Crisis Worker Participants raised concerns that this impacted on the quality of care being provided I think that s the thing it s like not being able to give the level of service that I would normally be happy to give Crisis Worker This view was echoed by victims and survivors I feel nervous and alone but there will be a unknown lady in the live link room with me who will sit behind me but she doesn t know what s happened and you can t grab her hand for support S months One survivor reported a particularly negative experience asso ciated with expectations about face coverings and how this impacted on her care when attending for a routine cervical smear test at her family doctor practice I can t wear a face mask due to anxiety I booked in for a smear at GP general practitioner I explained to the receptionist she was lovely and I was offered to try a screen face shield I tried but I couldn t do it The nurse came out screaming at me shouting at me put your mask on Immediately triggered my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder I was deeply upset I said to her you should know better you re a health professional The receptionist brought me a cup of tea with sugar I was so upset I couldn t do the smear and I still haven t had it S baseline International Review of Victimology Availability and access to support services Access to services during the pandemic was an important theme for participants with nearly of the sample commenting on this Of these half reported No change in service or access however the remainder identified significant Difficulties or delays in accessing services and a Lack of sup port services or reduction in support services Both victims and survivors and professionals identi fied that victims and survivors were experiencing longer waiting times particularly for therapeutic or counselling services I have been on a waiting list for counselling and when I joined the waiting list it was like an month wait and when that period came I would have been sure to start that in December but because of Covid it has all been put back There have been delays in being able to have that and I don t know when that will be It will be coming up two years in May June time that I will have been on the waiting list S year Waiting times to access standard appointments were also longer specifically in accessing family doctors services general practice It has been harder to get appointments for the doctors and stuff it took me a good few months to get an actual appointment with my GP about antidepressants S months As services were only contactable online or via the telephone victims and survi vors were unable to make contact I ve tried and tried calling them and I never get an answer or reply from them S year Delays were also experienced in criminal justice processes It has slowed down the police investigation a lot S baseline and access to justice with court cases cancelled or delayed on several occasions While this theme demonstrates the mixed experiences of participants in relation to availability and access to services representing exosystem factors this theme should be carefully considered in the context of the next theme whereby the mode or nature of interactions between survivors and service providers microsystem has changed significantly Delivering care and support online or by telephone Half of the participants explored their perceptions of the shift to remote care and support of these nearly two thirds of the victims survivors and professionals were negative about online telephone service delivery with strong preferences for face to face service delivery particu larly for counselling but also in relation to other services like family doctors general practice and the police For these participants online telephone service delivery reduced engagement in help seeking and support e g Yes because of coronavirus I can t go in person so I m waiting for when the clinic opens because I am not really wanting to speak about this over the phone S baseline and victims and survivors reported not wanting this mode of support The therapist referred me to a mindfulness course which I started but I have stopped as it s online S months Professionals spoke about clients who they believed had disengaged from services due to not being able to engage in online telephone services The appropriateness of this mode of care for younger and older clients also raised concerns The issue of interactions between victims and survivors and professionals was also a feature of this theme as seen in the Covid control measures where participants said remote care created new challenges in building rapport which could impact on the trust therapeutic relationship and presented a bar rier between victims and survivors and professionals Victims and survivors talked about the need to have a proper chat S baseline that there was more of a disconnect over the Sleath et al phone S baseline and that It s harder to build relationships online and it makes peo ple s body language harder to read S months Professionals echoed these concerns and said they worried they were missing important communication cues from clients You can t see how someone is you know some people we ve spoken to over the phone have gone quite quiet at different points and you don t know whether they re just actually distracted by something and they re fine or they make themselves a drink or something Or actually they re upset and they re struggling to answer the question or struggling to speak Deputy SARC Manager While a large proportion voiced negative views of this mode of care and support of survivors identified benefits of remote care particularly in making services easier to engage with In contrast to the views above these participants felt that talking over the phone online was easier because they felt more relaxed S baseline that the distance of a telephone call is better for me S base line when talking about difficult topics and that it speaking over the phone didn t feel like such a big deal S baseline Linking the mode of delivery with accessibility victims and survivors welcomed not needing to travel and that appointments could fit more easily into a day a view ech oed by professionals who noted the ease of accessibility and that this worked for particular types of clients e g older adolescents SARC staff emphasised how triaging clients by phone reduced the time needed on site at the SARC where shorter attendance times were viewed again to increase the accessibility of ser vices particularly for clients with caregiving responsibilities Staff reported feeling better pre pared for clients when they arrived because we ve done all that over the phone and got more info over the phone than we usually would it means that we re able to set up and prepare prior to the victim arriving Deputy SARC Manager Specifically in relation to children staff talked about more opportunities to allay concerns of parents guardians before attending and to learn about things that may make the visit easier for children to undertake We can think about you know if they say oh she loves Paw Patrol then we load up the iPad with a Paw Patrol video Clinical Director Negative impacts on staff due to changes in service delivery Professionals working in sexual abuse and violence services experienced a considerable shift from being co located with their teams and colleagues at their usual service premises to individual home working In reflecting on this change professionals reported Blurred work life boundaries demonstrating important organisational challenges to the segmentation between work and home and the specific challenges given the nature of their work I think an additional impact from this whole situation is like now that we re doing email referrals from home it kind of brings it into my kind of safe space and when I get home from work I want to be home from work I don t want to be thinking about it and it s here it s in my house now like I m reading about these awful things happening to people in my home Crisis Worker Participants referred to other negative impacts of lone working and transition to home offices focusing on the loss of team support network demonstrating challenges at the mesosystem level I think I ve got more used to it now but I think in early lockdown I was really struggling because normally I d be in the office and if I was on a really hard call or you know it sounded quite heavy there would International Review of Victimology usually be someone in the office that would be like oh are you okay Do you want to go for a walk and a break Triage Worker While professionals talked about approaches that had been implemented in recognition of this issue e g WhatsApp groups more frequent check in with managers there was still a sense that self care suffered in a context of home working when you re in person in the office at the minute you feel you need to talk to someone you get to just stop and talk about stuff ISVA This demonstrates the importance of mesosystem level factors for the resilience of professionals which ultimately impacts on quality and availability of care and support provided to survivors Other impacts explored the practical challenges of home working including the need to acquire suitable equipment and to access confidential sensitive client information at home securely Discussion The pandemic produced a recalibration of health and care service delivery and insights and appli cations that will be vital for buffering services and service users including survivors of sexual violence Majeed Ariss et al against extraordinary events of the future This study contrib utes to this knowledge having gathered in real time the voices of people who had been seeking support for exposure to SV when the pandemic hit or were victimised during the pandemic period Its novelty is in hearing directly about the experiences of sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors in accessing and engaging in remote care and how the pandemic was perceived to have affected their recovery journeys The study additionally presents the perspectives of professionals from a range of health and support organisations to highlight the impacts of the wide scale changes to service delivery and uncover new potential opportunities and challenges for the future of service delivery in this area Discussion papers e g Gunby et al and research providing a snapshot of the impact of COVID e g Almeida anticipated some of these challenges however this research grounds those factors in data provided by victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse augmented by professionals in the sexual violence sector Although based in an English context these impacts and their implications are relevant internationally for example the shift to remote care and support was undertaken globally e g Polk Contributions to theory model In the context of the current study the rupturing of normal daily life had serious implications for the coping mechanisms and help seeking use by victims and survivors In doing so this demon strates how the additional impacts of the pandemic disrupted recovery journeys Victims and survivors reported worsening symptoms of depression anxiety or worry as well as increased feelings of isolation and depleted resources e g reduced access to coping strategies such as exercise and opportunities for recovery In establishing safety Herman identifies how survivors can oscillate between surrounding themselves with people at all times and isolating themselves entirely In relation to the former the pandemic significantly disrupted the opportu nities that survivors had for contact with friends and family frequently well understood to pro mote positive well being for sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors e g Littleton For the latter a small number of survivors identified the benefits of the pandemic in rela tion to safety seeing the pandemic restrictions as a way to feel protected reducing their Sleath et al interactions with other people and considering this a time for healing Alongside the impacts of the pandemic on well being the pandemic also disrupted usual pathways to support e g shift to remote care potentially undermining or protracting the remembrance and mourning stage of recovery Victims and survivors reported reduced access to care delays to care and poor percep tions experiences of remote care In contrast as with the findings in relation to safety a smaller number of survivors reported benefits to the shift to remote care enhancing their ability to engage and process their trauma through remote means Finally in relation to reconnection the impacts of the pandemic are clearly visible across the data in hindering a survivor from engaging more actively in the world In summary Herman s trauma theory contextualises these findings in relation to how the pandemic may have slowed or protracted recovery Furthermore trauma researchers have determined that the pandemic itself was experienced as a form of trauma or traumatic stress Bridgland et al adding further complexity to the recovery journeys for survivors of sexual violence during this time Previous research has identified a need for a more detailed understanding of the different factors of the ecological model and importantly how these different factors interact Campbell et al Zinzow et al This research delivers this by capturing interactions across multiple layers of the model and so extends our understanding of the ecological model in relation to help seeking and recovery journeys It demonstrates how the pandemic context exacerbated or produced barriers and facilitators to recovery for survivors by highlighting interactions between policies and procedures such as Covid safety measures as exosystem factors and how these impact microsystem factors in the quality of interactions between victims and survivors and service pro viders Of significance for this research was the importance of mesosystem factors as an individ ual factor e g interactions between professionals but also in its interactions with other layers of the ecological model specifically exosystem e g accessibility of services and microsystem fac tors e g interactions between victims and survivors and professionals Therefore the data offer multiple instances of interplay and influence between the levels of these factors In doing so it presents a more detailed and nuanced comprehension of how these levels may exacerbate or worsen health outcomes for victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse The ecological model was also relevant to findings relating to professionals Concerns were raised in the early literature published in the pandemic regarding service delivery at the mesosys tem level e g Gunby et al These data document those findings but also highlight the critical need to resolve the associated challenges facing professionals at this mesosystem level linking theory to practice specifically in relation to blurred work home life boundaries and reduced access to team support which are magnified among those working in the sexual violence and abuse services Crivatu et al While many organisations returned to face to face ser vices as pandemic restrictions reduced or were removed the majority continue to deliver their services using a blended approach The Survivors Trust Urgent consideration therefore needs to focus on how these staff will be supported to reduce the likelihood of them experiencing the negative impacts of working in this sector for example compassion fatigue burnout Factors such as organisational culture and supervisor and co worker support represent potentially inter acting factors across macrosystems and mesosystems so it is important to understand the role of such factors in the specific context of those who work in the sexual violence sector For example supervisors should consider their role in supporting staff in this new way of working to manage their work life domains Ultimately the resilience of this sector impacts on the quality of the sup port provided to survivors of sexual violence and abuse Given the findings of this study suggest International Review of Victimology that there may be increased service use by victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse in the longer term as a result of the pandemic this issue is of critical importance to ensure there is a robust and resilient sector Contribution to practice In the context of the current study the rupturing of normal daily life had serious implications for victims and survivors Not being able to address the mental health sequelae of abuse and the cumu lative effects of experiencing the pandemic are likely to have knock on effects for economic and social well being for education and in respect of caring responsibilities and looking after children If victims and survivors experience longer periods where they need help e g waiting for their legal case to be heard in court service providers are likely to find that clients remain with them longer and or may require more intensive support and therapy where disclosure has been delayed and early intervention has therefore not been forthcoming e g Bicanic et al Ruggiero et al Post pandemic service providers have continued to adapt but consideration of longer term plans for their service is needed specifically focusing on how the pandemic has shaped the needs of clients and the timing of disclosure e g survivors reporting historic abuse victims of sexual offences where there are complex needs linked to social and housing circumstances disability and substance use Such changes in the length of support and nature of presenting or comorbid issues are likely to add further strain to a sector that was already over stretched and under funded prior to the pandemic e g Rape Crisis Changes to modes of service delivery e g the shift from in person to remote care raised mul tiple concerns in our participants suggesting an inefficient mechanism for supporting recovery but these negative perceptions need to be set in context First the provision of remote care was unlikely to have caused more harm than not providing the care at all Second and as noted by Smith et al these changes in delivery were imposed on clients rather than selected by choice which may have affected how clients perceived them Brown et al argued that if services are to be delivered through remote technology platforms or simply by telephone it is critical to prepare victims and survivors and their carers appropriately and manage people s expectations suggesting a pathway to where clients may find this mode of delivery more acceptable Furthermore in these data positive responses about remote care emphasised ease of engagement and factors that could increase the accessibility and quality of services provided to sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors while also reducing rates of cancelled appointments of particular relevance when resources are stretched There are many considerations in selecting remote or in person care including the stage the person is at vis \u00e0 vis disclosure and the complexity of their needs and their circumstances can a client achieve safety and confidentiality at home and importantly the nature of the care and support being delivered On the one hand providing advocacy and low intensity emotional support remotely may work quite effectively for providers and clients alike For therapy and counselling some therapies for example trauma focused CBT in Acierno et al do lend themselves to remote delivery however others e g EMDR may require in person interaction The resulting message from this current study is that victims and survivors are not a homogeneous group and differ in their needs and support requirements The sector itself frequently recognises this but more broadly commissioning frameworks need to acknowledge that a one size fits all approach specifically in relation to the mode of delivery that is that either in person or remote care should be provided is unlikely to represent best practice in supporting clients Sleath et al Therefore commissioners may need to facilitate processes that enable organisations to consider how to extend client options in respect of how support is provided it need not be a dichotomous set of possibilities Within organisations establishing the needs and preferences of clients could encompass aspects set out in Box Box Considerations in selecting an approach to service delivery What approaches or methods do clients feel most able and comfortable to use How can they best convey their own needs and views e g does the client recognise a difficulty with communicating over the telephone Explore with the client any barriers or enablers to talking about challenging or sensitive issues What approaches or methods address these barriers and enablers e g trust rapport What is the most appropriate therapeutic approach for the presenting issues and how does this fit with the communication preferences of the client Encourage clients to identify practical considerations e g access to adequate internet services an occupation or care giving responsibilities that mean it is challenging to schedule face to face appointments who else is living at home and can the client find a quiet confidential safe space Equally the provider needs to consider these factors for themselves to ensure they are in a position to offer best practice response e g a stable internet connection access to support where they are supporting high risk clients or difficult issues have arisen This decision making process is most important at the beginning of service use however organisations will know that clients needs can change over the course of service engagement This means that services should reflect on whether and how they can will provide support flexi bly where clients may shift modes of delivery according to their changing needs on their recovery journey These are not small considerations particularly in the context of resource constraints however the professionals within this study recognised the cost effectiveness of ubiquitous tech nology based support solutions Limitations While the research was possible due to an existing research infrastructure ongoing longitudi nal study with survivors of sexual violence post SARC the exploration of the impact of COVID on victims and survivors journeys was a small component of the full interview A greater focus on the impact of Covid may have uncovered additional experiences We inter viewed victims and survivors post contact with a SARC and there were variations in their recovery journeys and experiences For example not all were involved in criminal justice processes and there was great variation in the stage of this process in those that were so most had not experienced court trials and so would not have been able to comment on these aspects The participants in the MESARCH study represent a specific help seeking sample and as such do not represent victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse across the English population For example SARC users more often seek help for stranger and acquaintance sexual assault Lovell et al which may carry less stigma and therefore promote capaci ties to seek help Finally as the responses were documented verbatim by interviewers rather than being audio recorded there is the small potential for loss of meaning or misunderstanding of content in the contemporaneous noting of these responses International Review of Victimology Conclusion This study has identified important implications of the pandemic for victims and survivors profes sionals and service use in the future spanning both theory and practice COVID amplified the challenges of living as a victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse impinging and interact ing across multiple levels of the ecological model and subsequently diminishing pathways to help seeking across health services voluntary sector support and criminal justice Experiencing sexual violence and abuse significantly disrupts people s lives WHO and the challenges to recov ery journeys of victims and survivors identified in our research of which seeking access to justice and therapy are key parts means that those impacts continue to ripple across the lives of victims and survivors their families children and other supporters Future research exploring the longer term impact of the pandemic on victims and survivors recovery journeys is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of their experiences This research also needs to include victims and survivors who did not access SARC services as their experiences may be different from the spe cific help seeking sample in our study The pandemic amplified the emotional work associated with providing services to victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse with less recourse to sources of support for staff against a backdrop of blurred work life boundaries and a changed mix of clients accessing ser vices Organisations need to consider carefully how they can support staff to mitigate any poten tial negative impacts to the new ways in which they work reducing the likelihood of burnout and compassion fatigue and avoiding further reductions in staffing and resources in the sector The research has highlighted some positive developments as a result of adapting to the pandemic in terms of identifying new methods and strategies that may be integrated into best practice responses to sexual violence and abuse For example triaging clients before attending a SARC may increase the accessibility of the services for clients with particular needs This evidence can inform service responses to future global crises and remains important even now to increase the accessibility and ease of availability of services for some clients This remains an important consideration for victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse who frequently experience barriers to care and support In summary empowerment through offering options is a hallmark of a good practice response in this context the experiences of victims and survivors and organisations adapting to pandemic conditions has uncovered advantages of cost effective ubiquitous technology solu tions for providing information advocacy and short and long term support There is significant scope for these opportunities to be captured and integrated into service delivery more long term However these come with the important caveat that any novel service improvement should be underpinned by client choice

across England and Wales between and fi This allows vulnerable and or intimidated witnesses and complainants who have rst pre recorded their evidence in chief through a police video recorded interview to pre record their cross examination which is then presented to the court during the substantive trial This article critically explores s by drawing upon qualitative data from semi structured interviews conducted with participants across seven stakeholder groups including criminal justice practitioners and complainants and their families in sexual offences cases Through a fi critical consideration of the articulated bene ts associated with s within the context of sex ual offences cases we argue that there continue to be substantial challenges associated with its implementation that reduce its prospects for success and which need to be addressed as a priority Keywords Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act section pre recorded cross examination sexual offences vulnerable and intimidated witnesses Introduction The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act YJCEA introduced a range of special measures designed to help vulnerable and or intimidated complainants and witnesses give their best evidence during a criminal trial These special measures include the use of screens to shield the witness or com plainant from the defendant Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s the use of a live video link allowing the witness or complainant to give evidence from outside the courtroom Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s and the removal of wigs and gowns by counsel and judges Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s Section hereafter s is the last of the special mea sures under the YJCEA to be implemented and allows vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to record fi their cross examination before the trial Baverstock In this article we draw on ndings from a wider project entitled Justice in Covid for Sexual Abuse and Violence hereafter JICSAV that explored innovations and challenges in the justice journeys of rape and sexual assault com plainants during and beyond the Covid pandemic www coventry ac uk research research directories current projects jicsav Data for that project was collected between May and May with fi a focus on experiences in the period since the rst lockdown came into force in the UK on March As such our data collection coincided with key stages in the piloting and roll out of s in fi England and Wales In that context our participants extensively discussed s revealing a signi cant implementation gap for this measure which we argue is likely to substantially undermine its effective operation fi In what follows we divide our discussion into three main parts In the rst part we provide a brief description of the background to and design of s in England and Wales including an account of fi its implementation journey to date and the key ndings from associated Ministry of Justice process eva luations We then turn to our JICSAV project and describe the collection and analysis methods used in fi relation to the data that underpin the ndings and discussion we present here In the third and most sub fi stantive part we set out our key ndings relevant to s In a context in which the implementation of s has inevitably continued to evolve in the period since our data collection we also highlight here the fi fl extent to which more recent commentary supports the ongoing relevance of our ndings and re ect on Munro et al the overall implications for the future operation of this special measure a matter on which there remains fi considerable concern and debate UK Parliament In the nal section we conclude that s has the potential to bring improved experiences for complainants and witnesses However there remain sub stantial challenges to its implementation that reduce its prospects for success and which need to be fi addressed as a priority While some of these may be speci c to the English and Welsh context and or to s procedures many are apt to also be encountered in other jurisdictions including for example Scotland Northern Ireland New Zealand and some Australian states where reforms to expand modes of testimony delivery to include more routine use of pre recorded cross examination par ticularly by witnesses in sexual offence cases have recently been recommended announced or imple mented see further e g Gillen Sexual Violence Legislation Act New Zealand Victims Witnesses and Justice Reform Scotland Bill Victoria Law Reform Commission Section Background and implementation S of the YJCEA allows vulnerable and or intimidated witnesses and complainants in England and Wales to pre record their cross examination before the trial so that the s recording can be pre sented during trial without the witness needing to attend This special measure can only be used where an Achieving Best Evidence ABE investigative interview has already been video recorded by the police under Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s which is typically then relied upon to provide the complainant s evidence in chief fi fi Any complainant who is eligible for and may bene t from utilising s should be identi ed by the fi police investigating of cer as early as possible in the investigation process as outlined in the Criminal fi Practice Directions The Crown Prosecution Service CPS should also be noti ed by fi the of cer at an early stage that the case is one that could potentially involve use of s Once a positive charging decision has been reached the CPS prosecutor should notify the Magistrates Court at the First Hearing about any s application which is then made at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing PTPH in the Crown Court If the s application is accepted the timetable for the case should also be agreed at the PTPH Although its availability is not restricted to witnesses in sexual offence cases recent evidence submitted to the Justice Committee Inquiry on the use of s has indicated that since the commence ment of pilot provision to vulnerable witnesses in these have constituted the overwhelming volume of cases where the measure has been used per cent Thomas para Case management in a s case requires early disclosure and a Ground Rules Hearing GRH In relation to the former processes for securing and screening disclosure should begin immediately even prior to any charging decision Baverstock This is key to ensuring timely case progression fi more broadly but in s cases it can be particularly important since many of the bene ts to complainants and witnesses of earlier evidence capture will be negated if they have to be recalled for further cross examination because of new information or evidence in the case The right of the defendant to a fair trial in s cases is also safeguarded in this context In relation to the GRH the individual needs of the complainant should be discussed as well as the particulars of the cross examination process In the case of vulnerable complainants the length of the s hearing and the questions to be put will also be determined Criminal Practice Directions The s hearing marks the beginning of the trial Criminal Practice Directions At the hearing the complainant will be cross examined and re examined if required via the live link from the courtroom to the witness suite and the evidence will be recorded Criminal Practice Directions Following the hearing the judge will then make further orders in relation to the progress of the case as well as any editing of the recording as agreed between the prosecution and defence counsel Criminal Practice Directions The cross examination recording is then stored securely until it is played to the jury at trial The International Journal of Evidence Proof Section cases thus have distinctive practical features Amongst them is the expedited timeframe required in relation to case investigation and preparation charging and disclosure This means that much of the work in s cases is front loaded particularly for the police and CPS A further feature is the requirement for continuity of prosecution counsel throughout the PTPH GRH s hearing and the remainder of the substantive trial Whilst continuity of defence representation is also encouraged it is not currently mandatory unless ordered by the judge Criminal Practice Directions Similarly whilst it is possible that the same judge may sit throughout the case this is not required unless ordered by the resident judge or nominated lead s judge Criminal Practice Directions The recording of cross examination prior to trial allows it to take place earlier in the process which may aid witness and complainant recall and thereby improve the quality of substantive evidence Roswell et al Section also aims to improve the experience of the criminal justice process for witnesses and complainants more broadly by reducing the anxiety that might otherwise be associated with attending court and enabling them to access support earlier Baverstock e g counselling and therapy for complainants in sexual offences cases Despite widespread support for these aims during the legislation s drafting and enactment and the more rapid implementation of other special measures contained within the YJCEA s was not immediately implemented due to concerns about the procedural changes required the available IT at the time and the cost fi Baverstock Indeed it was not until that it was rst piloted in three Crown Courts in fi England Liverpool Leeds and Kingston upon Thames with this pilot being speci cally restricted to the category of vulnerable witnesses and complainants Vulnerable witnesses are those who are under the age of at the time of the hearing or whose quality of evidence is likely to be diminished fi because they are suffering from a mental disorder they have a signi cant impairment of social function ing or intelligence or they have a physical disability or are suffering from a physical disorder Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s The Ministry of Justice commissioned a process evaluation of this pilot to help understand whether the pilot processes worked as intended and to help guide policy decisions on whether and how best to roll out s more widely after the pilot Baverstock This evaluation pub lished in captured the perspectives of practitioners alongside witnesses and their parents carers who utilised the s measure It also analysed monitoring data collected during the pilot in order to generate indicative estimates of the potential outcomes and timeliness of s cases and the potential volume of cases in the event of a wider roll out Baverstock It concluded based on analysis of cases where s was used by witnesses in the pilot courts that the measure could save court time by reducing trial length Baverstock and may encourage greater use of guilty pleas by defendants as a consequence of evidence being gathered and disclosed to the defence sooner Baverstock and The evaluation also reported that the majority of professionals and trial parties involved felt the measure facilitated improved witness recall better quality evidence Baverstock and a less distressing engagement with the justice process overall Baverstock Following on from this broadly positive appraisal in the pilot was extended within the three original courts to include intimidated witnesses and complainants Flury that is those whose quality of evidence is likely to be diminished by reason of fear or distress in relation to testifying in the case Complainants in sexual offences and modern slavery cases automatically fall into this category Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act s Four additional courts Durham Isleworth Wood Green and Harrow also joined the extended pilot in Flury In s began to be rolled out nationally across the Crown Court estate albeit limited at that stage to vulnerable wit nesses and complainants In June the Government s long awaited End to End Rape Review report was published Within it amongst other things there was a commitment to evaluate the pilot involving intimidated Munro et al witnesses and complainants prior to also rolling out s to this cohort at all Crown Courts HM Government para A second evaluation was to be commissioned which would explore witness and practitioner views and experiences of s to help understand whether the s provision for s intimidated witnesses worked as intended and any improvements that could be made Ward et al As part of this second process evaluation interviews were conducted with criminal justice practi tioners and intimidated witnesses of whom had used the s special measure Ward et al fi Though its ndings were not in fact published until in the period following the End to End Rape Review a phased roll out of s for intimidated witnesses and complainants was nonetheless undertaken being completed across England and Wales in September Ward et al While fi this expedited process rendered the ndings of the second evaluation somewhat redundant in determining the appropriateness of a national roll out for this cohort it nevertheless provided useful insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with the operation of the provision and its effects on trial pro cesses These included an improved experience for witnesses giving evidence via s compared to fi cross examination live at trial Ward et al but mixed perceptions around the bene ts of s in relation to witness attrition and engagement and concerns about negative impacts on court listing pressures Ward et al In addition although the process evaluation did not explore the impact of the use of s on pleas or conviction outcomes directly through data from the pilot sites it reported that participants felt that there would likely be minimal impact thereon Ward et al Together these two process evaluations commissioned by the Ministry of Justice do provide import ant insight not least since until very recently they afforded the only published analyses of s which incorporated qualitative data gathered from criminal justice professionals and witnesses By the authors own admissions however both are limited in their scope The pilot process evaluation uti lised a small sample of practitioners n and witness interviews n and an analysis of monitor ing data from the three pilot courts Leeds Liverpool and Kingston upon Thames with a potentially fi signi cant acknowledgement from the outset that the courts chosen for the pilot were selected because judges in those courts were supportive of the principles of s Baverstock As fi such the generalisability of the evaluation s ndings outside of the pilot areas is unclear Similar issues also befall the evaluation which summarised the views and experiences of a small cross section of practitioners and witnesses in a select few pilot areas working at different stages of the roll out Ward et al The focus within both evaluations solely on the pilot regions means that their wider applicability may be limited particularly given the additional resourcing afforded to ori fi ginal pilot sites for their role in the development and implementation of s and the signi cant variabil ity of infrastructure listing pressures and personnel resources across the country It is also notable that no members of the judiciary were interviewed in the evaluation despite their importance to the effect fi ive operation of s with the Judicial Of ce instead only providing a written response Ward et al A Justice Committee Inquiry initiated in has now generated further important insight via sub missions from various practitioner and academic stakeholders including the JICSAV team JICSAV fi These submissions have documented ndings that supplement existing process evaluations for example through additional research interviews with practitioners involved in s cases outside of pilot regions Fairclough and or through observation of the current day to day realities of the trial process for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses whether or not they make use of s measures Jackson et al Kyneswood Some submissions have highlighted with particular urgency and concern the practical effects of the extended roll out of s on court listings and barristers work loads CBA COEUS while one has reported a potentially negative effect on the prospects for conviction as a result of using s at least under current conditions of implementation Thomas Together with other related research that has recently explored broader shifts within the landscape The International Journal of Evidence Proof of adversarial cross examination Jackson et al and evaluated the adequacy of current prosecutor ial strategy in rape and serious sexual offences RASSO cases King et al this has presented a complicated picture It is one in which it is clear that as we discuss below s has the potential to bring improved experiences and positive outcomes for complainants and witnesses but there have been and continue to be substantial challenges to implementation that reduce prospects for success and which must be addressed as a priority Methods This article provides insight into the implementation and impacts of s against a fast evolving policy fi and practice context We draw speci cally on novel qualitative data in the form of in depth semi structured interviews which were conducted with participants across seven stakeholder groups including criminal justice practitioners and complainants and their families in sexual offences cases This repre sents a larger and more diverse cross section of interviewees than in the s process evaluations or pre existing academic research Our participants came from across England and Wales and unlike the Ministry of Justice s evaluations our study included direct discussion with judges authorised to hear RASSO cases Though our data clearly does not address all of the questions that require to be considered in a rounded evaluation of s in particular for example we do not have access to quantitative data regarding scale of usage timeframes for case progression and plea or conviction outcomes it does provide important and original insights regarding users experiences of the special measure in practice and the ways in which oversights and shortfalls in implementation have at times presented substantial fi fi barriers Moreover while our eldwork ended in mid as we will demonstrate our ndings continue fi fi to resonate with more recent accounts affording con dence when extrapolating ndings from this dataset to contemporary debates As noted above the data underpinning this article were collected as part of the JICSAV project JICSAV which aimed to identify impacts of the Covid pandemic on criminal justice policies and practices in sexual offences cases as well as on practitioners complainants and their families and to pinpoint innovations that could improve the experiences of complainants in sexual offences cases beyond the pandemic Whilst s was not introduced in response to the pandemic nor was it an initial focus of JICSAV in early interviews with criminal justice practitioners it was discussed by all participants because a phased national roll out had begun in during the pandemic period Due to the emphasis fi placed on s by these participants the interview schedule was amended to speci cally include ques tions about it A substantial amount of qualitative data was thus gathered about the implementation and impact of s in sexual offences cases in the Crown Court The fact that the data we explore in this article originated from a project looking at the wider effects of the Covid pandemic on justice fi systems rather than one designed speci cally around s is important to bear in mind given the self selecting nature of participation Indeed the prominence of views and experiences regarding s that fi fi emerged across interviews designed to span a wider range of issues is itself a signi cant nding illus trating the scale of respondents engagement with and concern about or appreciation of this innovation Between May and May in depth semi structured interviews were conducted with individuals across seven stakeholders groups third sector professionals Independent Sexual Violence Advisors ISVAs and Children and Young People s Independent Sexual Violence Advisors fi CHISVAs professionals from Sexual Assaults Referral Centres SARCS police of cers working on sexual offence investigations CPS Senior or Chief Crown Prosecutors working within fi RASSO units RASSO certi ed criminal barristers with experience both in prosecuting and defending cases judges holding authorisation to hear RASSO cases and complainants and or their family members Six online workshops attended by over practitioners policy makers and academics fi were also held during the project where ndings including in relation to the design and implementation of s were discussed Munro et al Interview participants were approached for involvement through a range of avenues including via researchers existing networks project partners and advisory group members and social media Whilst criminal justice practitioners and complainants and their family members were opportunistically sampled attention was paid to the diversity of participants throughout with the aim of being as represen tative as possible e g in terms of participants gender race geographic location professional role etc Professionals and practitioners were asked about the impacts of the Covid pandemic on the progres sion of and responses to sexual offences cases Complainants and their family members were invited to discuss their experiences of being involved in any aspect of the criminal justice process during the pan demic for example reporting the offence ISVA support police and CPS case decision making or the trial process Interviews were mostly conducted online using video conferencing software with a small number being conducted by telephone All were audio recorded before being transcribed and anonymised with identifying information removed Ethical approvals for the research were gained from the authors universities Formal permission for fi judicial involvement in the project was obtained from the Judicial Of ce and CPS involvement was approved by CPS Headquarters Project leadership included lived expertise and the Charter for Engaging Survivors in Research Per\u00f4t et al informed our engagement with complainants and their families who were given details of support services that could be accessed both prior to and follow ing their interviews These participants were also each provided with a voucher to thank them for their time All participants received a detailed information sheet prior to their interview and they all signed consent forms The qualitative data underwent thematic analysis using both inductive and deductive approaches fi Braun and Clarke Each transcript was rstly reviewed and coded by hand by two members of the team with each independently drawing out key patterns and themes that emerged and then com fi paring them to ensure cross validation of ndings To support this manual process transcripts were fi then coded electronically using NVivo This allowed themes to be further re ned additional themes fi and sub themes to be identi ed and for any associations between themes to be explored The project s Research Associate supported data analysis across all participant groups to ensure consistency and fi quality Themes identi ed in this way informed the six workshops held across the project fi Discussions therein further supported and re ned our analysis ensuring the robustness and quality fi of research ndings In what follows we provide a critical appraisal of s and its implementation informed by the experiences and perspectives provided by our research participants Discussions are organised thematically around the following four overarching themes promoting recall and recovery and redu cing re traumatisation resourcing listings and logistical challenges mediating effects and malfunc tioning technology and silver bullets and second chances These themes continue to resonate with more recent commentaries around the operation of s which have emerged since we completed fl our data collection and which we engage with below As such they re ect issues around implemen tation and impact that remain of ongoing concern albeit often within the broader context of a recog fi nition of the potential bene ts associated with s for some complainants and witnesses in sexual offences cases Section implementation Goals and gaps Promoting recall and recovery and reducing re traumatisation Across our interview participants there was a fairly settled view that the introduction of the s fi special measure at least for use by those identi ed under s of the YJCEA as vulnerable wit fi nesses and in particular young children was a welcome innovation Two principal bene ts associated with the use of s by this cohort were highlighted First that early capture of evidence might improve The International Journal of Evidence Proof prospects for accurate recall and second that it avoided the prospect of testimony giving and court attendance looming over witnesses for an extended period of time in a context in which the dam aging effects of trial delays and disruption are substantial and well documented Rape Crisis England and Wales fi fl In relation to the rst point a Detective Constable P re ected for example that it can mas sively help in cases where you re dealing with children and recounted a case involving a six year old complainant whose memory had already deteriorated in the time delay between his original ABE interview and s examination P hypothesised that if this witness had been required to await a trial date before completing their cross examination it could potentially mean that he wasn t able to give any evidence and could mean that we end up losing cases at court Indeed several par fi ticipants were clear that s was of most bene t to child complainants for whom recollection was thought to be more at risk of impairments whilst waiting for trial Ward et al when com pared to adult witnesses something that has also been documented within existing literature Gudjonsson and Henry fi Though such bene ts in relation to recall and recovery could also be relevant to the use of s by intimidated adult witnesses it was clear that several of our participants were less convinced by their value in this context For example a RASSO ticketed judge J stated that s should be limited to those witnesses for whom memory or trauma really is a live issue so children or witnesses fi fi with pronounced learning dif culties or very dif cult mental health issues Within this context another RASSO ticketed judge J likewise questioned the value of s for recall and recovery in cases where the adult witness was giving testimony in respect of an allegation of non recent abuse They explained It is excellent to be able to capture someone s evidence well in advance particularly if they re very young it s absolutely crucial because obviously children s memories are different to adults and shorter But where you ve got an adult complainant making a complaint about something that happened years ago perhaps s is really quite pointless and may not be to the advantage of the complainant or the prosecution fl As we discuss in more detail later in the article such contributions may re ect a wider scepticism amongst some professionals regarding the extent to which otherwise competent adult witnesses need or indeed should be routinely offered such special measures in relation to testimony giving This appeared to be connected at times to a concern that jurors could be less sympathetic to and engaged with accounts provided by adults via a pre recording even where they might be able to appreciate its value or appropriateness in relation to child complainants fi In relation to the second bene t highlighted by participants which was linked to expedited time scales for evidence completion a Detective Sergeant P emphasised that use of s for child wit nesses will make a big difference in that it will speed up that process which they envisaged would fi be of considerable bene t to that child s wellbeing Meanwhile speaking more generally a Chief fi Crown Prosecutor C maintained that s was a massive bene t to complainants for whom if they can do their bit it s on the record it takes away that burden of having in the back of your mind all the time I m going to have to give evidence about this I m going to have to be cross examined Likewise a District Crown Prosecutor C emphasised that when s is used the victim s contribution is done and dusted and they can kind of move on a little bit while a Senior Crown Prosecutor C described victims as being able to step back from the process and get on with their lives after the s hearing is completed Such sentiment has since been formally echoed fi by the CPS in their recent submission to the Justice Committee Inquiry where ndings from research into wider operational shifts in RASSO cases as a result of Operation Soteria piloted in a timeline that broadly coincided with the roll out of s to intimidated witnesses were also drawn upon King et al There the CPS underscored lawyers frequently positive appraisal of s as Munro et al revolutionary making life easier for the complainant and giving them some control back in respect of the criminal justice process Crown Prosecution Service a para For many interviewees in our research this meant amongst other things that complainants were fi able to access counselling support with greater con dence that it would not undermine the justice process It was also recognised that there could be a reduced likelihood of complainant withdrawal if their evidence could be secured at an earlier stage with the prospect of further traumatisation in the court room being removed Indeed the Head of a CPS RASSO Unit C explained we know that delay causes attrition the longer a case goes on the more likely the victim will say I m out of here so s allows them to give their evidence in chief and cross examination earlier in the process and that s fi a clear bene t fi fi The potential for some signi cant bene ts to accrue as a result of using s in terms of recall and recovery particularly in relation to child witnesses are therefore clear Nevertheless other participants in our study were keen to caution that earlier capture of evidence did not always or fully relieve com plainants anxiety regarding an impending trial and its outcome see also Citizens Advice Witness Service Rape and Sexual Abuse Counselling Centre Darlington and Durham Support after Rape and Sexual Violence Leeds As one Senior ISVA S explained even if they ve done a s they ve still got a wait for the outcome so they just can t get on with their lives they can t focus on their recovery because they ve still got this thing hanging over their heads This was a sentiment echoed by a s lead judge J who acknowledged the practical realities asso ciated with an impending trial if you do a s it could be months A defendant could be on bail in the area where you live and you ve given your evidence and you re worrying about them having seen what you ve said Likewise the Criminal Bar Association s CBA submission to the Justice Committee con cluded that to take the view that s solves problems of delays in a backlogged criminal justice system by enabling victims to get their part in the trial process over with sooner is false reasoning and ignores fi the reality that victims and defendants still have the case as a whole hanging over them until the nal verdict CBA para As noted in the extract from the CBA above these issues are particularly pertinent in the context of the substantial backlog of cases RASSO and otherwise waiting to be heard in Crown Courts As of December RASSO cases were waiting to go to the Crown Court a new record high fi Rape Crisis England and Wales This backlog has increased signi cantly since the Covid pan demic when jury trials were initially suspended and then reinstated with strict social distancing restric tions There have also been intervening periods of barristers strike action and an overall attrition of practitioners from the criminal bar particularly pronounced in respect of practitioners undertaking RASSO work CBA para compounding that impact Indeed the current RASSO backlog represents an per cent increase from and the beginning of the Covid pandemic Rape fi Crisis England and Wales The bene t for complainants of delivering their evidence earlier in fi the process can be at least partially undermined where the trial is delayed or takes place a signi cant time after the s hearing and one barrister has recently suggested in evidence to the Justice Committee that an increase in s cases has itself exacerbated the backlog of cases yet to reach trial Mushtaq para Certainly new data shared with the Justice Committee Inquiry suggests fi that the average length of time between the s recording and case completion has increased signi cantly as the measure has been rolled out nationally Thomas Further investigation is clearly fl needed however to be able to ascertain whether these delays are a re ection of broader court congestion a diversion of trial resource to s proceedings or greater success in front loading investigations to allow for completion of s s at an earlier stage It was also noted by some of our participants that a completed s hearing could paradoxically reduce the impetus amongst professionals to push for a timely trial process A Senior Crown Prosecutor C observed that with cases that should be prioritised because there s a vulnerable victim or witness the trial dates are actually getting bumped off further than those which haven t The International Journal of Evidence Proof fi been identi ed as having vulnerable complainants or witnesses because they ve done their bit This was echoed too by individual barristers Mushtaq Roberts as well as the CBA in their submis sions to the Justice Committee with the CBA reporting that across their members collective experience courts often prioritise trials with live witnesses meaning that s cases can be delayed as judges con sider the evidence is already in the can CBA para In this context Senior Crown Prosecutor C was at pains to highlight during their interview that true closure cannot be achieved for trial parties until after the verdict regardless of when evidence is captured They explained that this is why I am not keen on s because as they put it if the witness actually just pitched up to the trial giving evidence in person they would have had that closure much sooner It is worth underscoring here that following the s hearing the witness is of course still unable to discuss the content of their evidence with anyone who is a witness in the case including in the fi case of children their parents which can present substantial dif culties One parent ISURF fl re ected on this in a context in which there had been an month delay between their child s s recording and their own testimony giving at trial they shared that not only did they feel unable to properly reconnect with their child during this period but they felt disempowered as a parent from being able to support them in their recovery I kind of felt that I didn t have all the little details and yet I m her sole carer I m expected to care for her without knowing everything fi This dif culty was also recognised by a Senior District Crown Prosecutor and Head of a RASSO Unit C who reported to us that When there s a parent who is also connected and a witness in that case I m told by ISVAs and CHISVAs particularly CHISVAs actually that that s creating some problems for them because they want to undertake fi work that is for the family and that s very dif cult when you ve got one person who s completed the child has completed their evidence but the adult hasn t This particular consequence was also recognised by the Citizen Advice Witness Service in their submission to the Justice Committee who noted that A long gap between the s hearing and the trial may cause particular issues where young family members have given evidence through s but others are required to be witnesses at the trial this can cause real emo fi tional dif culties within the family exacerbated by the long time lines involved Citizen Advice Witness Service fl Indeed such considerations led a s lead judge J to re ect that when you speak to people they say what the victim wants is closure and they re not getting it with s Though it may be optimistic to position the criminal justice system as a vehicle for providing closure to victims of rape and serious sexual offences Daly Herman McGlynn and Westmarland Munro it was clear in our interviews that for some of those who had been involved in s processes the experience had been substantially less traumatising than what they had anticipated based fi on their expectations of the adversarial courtroom In this context the bene ts both potential and in fi some cases realised of s are therefore signi cant For example one mother of a complainant ISURF described her daughter s use of s in her sexual offences trial to the researchers in the fol lowing way s is absolutely amazing the best thing perhaps to come out of the criminal justice system it took the edge off my daughter having to physically go into a courtroom and give evidence Even with the special measures that are put in place it s still intimidating for a young girl All our needs were met and then the good thing about it was that the questions were limited Munro et al The importance of this ought not to be lost sight of despite concerns regarding implementation challenges Resourcing listings and logistical challenges With child and adult witnesses alike concerns were expressed by many criminal justice practitioners in our study about the pressures that the expedited timeframes in s cases can cause For example a RASSO ticketed judge J observed that in order to get a s teed up all the things that normally take several weeks to achieve have got to be done within a very short period of time that puts enormous pressure on lots of different agencies They also observed that it requires a lot of hand holding a lot of micro managing to make sure things are done in the right timeframe by the judiciary This front loading was often felt most acutely by the police see also National Police Chiefs Council and CPS A Detective Constable P for example highlighted the requirements that it imposed on the police to have got your full schedules together in a much more limited time so as to ensure appropriate disclosure to the defence ahead of any s cross examination This is particularly challenging in the context of already stretched resources across the criminal justice system and an insuf fi fi cient number of specialist RASSO police of cers CPS lawyers and barristers as well as increasing reporting rates and caseloads Mushtaq see further King et al Interviewees explained that one of the biggest hurdles in relation to s was around the requirement for early disclosure One RASSO barrister C for example expressed concern about the extent to which this was achieved in practice noting the problem with doing s cases is that quite often you end up with material being disclosed after you ve conducted the cross examination that would have had an impact on the way that you cross examined This was echoed by J a RASSO ticketed judge who noted that it was more likely to arise as an issue in their view in relation to adult complai fi nants in sexual offence cases the dif culty with adult s cross examinations is that very often disclos ure of that type phones and other extraneous things takes a lot longer and so you run the risk that you may say to the witness right that s the end of your cross examination but then some new evidence comes in Though it remains formally open to the court to allow further cross examination in order for lines of fi questioning to be put to the witness that might not have previously been identi ed participants indicated there would be considerable reluctance to this in practice not least since as discussed above it would undermine one of the key aims associated with the provision of s which was to give witnesses some assurance that their role in proceedings was concluded and that they would not later need to come to court As J went on to express it you then have to re address the whole issue of whether the s fi was nite or not These challenges around the requirements of early disclosure in s cases particularly involving inti midated witnesses were also noted by Jackson et al in their submission to the Justice Committee Inquiry based on research into the changing nature of cross examination They explained how in instances where full disclosure is not made in time for the s hearing there was an obvious reluctance to schedule a second pre recorded cross examination Jackson et al As a result disclosure failures were potentially left to be addressed by an admission of agreed facts which could operate to the disadvantage of a complainant who is then not afforded the opportunity to give a response to the issue subsequently raised see also CBA para which expresses similar concerns Another dominant theme across participant contributions was the extent to which s had imposed additional demands on court resources and personnel in a context in which there were already acute shortages and overwhelming case backlogs to contend with In particular the requirement for continu ity of counsel and the subsequent logistics of ensuring that counsel can be available to conduct a s hearing on the scheduled date is challenging The reality is that in most cases the permission of a pre siding judge in a live trial in which counsel are engaged is required to hold over those proceedings and enable counsel to travel elsewhere to conduct the s hearing Where this permission is not granted The International Journal of Evidence Proof fi s hearings often have to be delayed which undermines their bene ts in terms of early capture and certainty for witnesses In the alternative they may proceed but then need to be conducted at short notice by someone other than the designated counsel who will lead the rest of the trial This frustrates the requirement for continuity of counsel and can introduce confusion into the cross examination process in a variety of ways including for trial parties and the jury Indeed the mother of a young com plainant that we interviewed during our research ISURF explained how on the morning of their child s s hearing they were informed that the prosecution barrister had changed to one they had never met before This understandably caused anxiety for both her and her child and may have fi reduced the quality of evidence adduced if the barrister had insuf cient time to familiarise themselves with the case Whilst the principle of continuity of counsel is important it has placed additional strains on courts in fi terms of being able to predictably and ef ciently list hearings to maximise available resource As one RASSO barrister C put it there have been huge listing problems arising as a consequence of the roll out of s nationally and to a wider cohort of witnesses It is causing all sorts of knock on problems to all sorts of other trials because you know you ve got to be there in person to do a s and if you re in the middle of a trial somewhere else you ve got to be there in person So it s the judicial equivalent of robbing Peter to pay Paul Similarly another RASSO barrister C observed that when there was only a few of them it was manageable but substantial shortages of barristers nationally coupled with Crown Court backlogs had already put huge pressure on diaries and they suggested this has only been compounded by the logis tical challenges of s see also Mushtaq Roberts The judiciary are then tasked with man aging requests from counsel to be released from trials to conduct s hearings which often presented fi fl signi cant dilemmas This was re ected in the observations of J a RASSO ticketed judge who described having been asked to excuse counsel from a week horrible familial rape and sexual abuse case and observed that you just think we re juggling competing vulnerabilities here Meanwhile other judges described the wider availability of s as incredibly disruptive for trial listing and man agement J a RASSO ticketed judge placing enormous pressure on every aspect of the system J a RASSO ticketed judge and imposing a huge burden on court staff J a s lead judge with a resident judge J observing that you shouldn t have a new system implemented which requires that level of optional cooperation since it is doomed to be unsuccessful These concerns regarding the logistics of attending s hearings and ensuring consistency of representation across trial processes were clearly acute for professional participants It was apparent however that they were often considered to be less insurmountable when the measure was restricted fi in its availability to vulnerable witnesses as de ned under s of the YJCEA This was partly because of the lower volume of cases involving such witnesses But it was also linked to the tighter man agement of s in these s cases and in particular to the use of GRHs to scrutinise the typically written questions that defence counsel envisaged putting to the witness to ensure that they were appro priate in tone and scope Doing so it was suggested by interviewees encouraged a more predictable s fl process A resident judge J re ected for example that what has changed is that approach to cross examination of young and vulnerable witnesses a change they attributed largely to the effects of a robust GRH during which the judge will rule out lines of cross examination that are really grandstanding for the defendant rather than asking pertinent questions of the witness This was echoed by a Chief Crown Prosecutor C who noted in relation to young and vulnerable witnesses that the cross examination process tends to be more concise see also Jackson et al Thus s hearings involving vulnerable witnesses and children can typically be completed fairly quickly with many fi judges listing these hearings rst thing in the morning to minimise disruption to other trials they were presiding over or counsel were appearing in Munro et al The position is however currently quite different in relation to intimidated witnesses Whilst it would be open to courts to impose a similarly structured process for scrutiny of questions intended to be asked of intimidated witnesses emerging evidence of the early operation of the provision indi cates that this rarely occurs Kyneswood Instead GRHs tend to be substantially more perfunc tory with advanced sight or detailed scrutiny of the questions intended for adult witnesses typically perceived to be unnecessary As a s lead judge J put it in relation to s hearings with vul nerable witnesses all the questions are all set out the intermediaries approved them and it s just a question of rat a tat tat Questions are asked we know what the answers are going to be to most they re going to be yes or no and there we go This was contrasted directly to the situation of an inti midated adult making a rape allegation who will not be cross examined in the same way with the same fi restrictions as a child There may be topics requested as opposed to speci c questions but it won t go any further than that Leaving aside concerns about the tone or relevance of such questioning which we return to further below at a practical level J underscored the impact that s going to have on the courtroom that the s is taking place in let s say it takes two hours rather than half an hour it is just going to cause complete and utter chaos This concern was echoed by the CBA in their submission to the Justice Committee Inquiry where they opined that the s provisions had been pasted onto the existing special measures regime with good intention but without the infrastructure to make it work able in practice CBA para and noted that while s may be an extremely useful tool in some cases they were concerned that it was being used far too widely in practice with the highly problematic extension to s intimidated witnesses having compounded this issue CBA para Mediating effects and malfunctioning technology Many participants expressed concern that the delivery of cross examination via pre recorded video par ticularly when following use of a pre recorded police interview as evidence in chief might dampen the impact of testimony for jurors with associated effects on assessments of credibility and sympathy that fl could in uence verdicts Barristers and judges in particular warned that s ran this risk because you re playing them an ABE which is an initial account and then you re playing them a pre recorded cross examination it s almost as if they re watching a movie C RASSO barrister This was con trasted with what was considered to be the much more impressive and poignant C RASSO barrister experience of witnesses giving evidence live in the courtroom Though several participants felt that the fi risk of juror disassociation may be less substantial in respect of child witnesses they were con dent that it would be an issue in relation to adults As a s lead judge J put it If you don t have an adult in the courtroom and they re just recorded I think you do lose the impact of the witness in court it s my gut feeling that juries don t listen the same way as if somebody is in the same room and of course the defendant is present always through the whole trial and they never lose sight of him This was reiterated to us by a RASSO ticketed judge J who explained that it s much easier to explain to a jury that the reason why they ve had s is because they re a child or because they fi have mental health dif culties but I m not enthusiastic with the whole roll out since it s going to fi be very dif cult to address in judicial directions as to why an adult would require a s rather than giving testimony in the standard way Such concerns around the potentially pejorative impacts of not having an adult witness giving evidence live in the criminal courtroom are well documented Munro As such it is perhaps unsurprising that this issue was raised by several participants in our study as well as being featured in evidence submitted by several practitioners CBA COEUS Mushtaq Roberts and academics Jackson et al Thomas to the Justice Committee Inquiry The International Journal of Evidence Proof Though the CBA have opined that juries well understand the fact of a child or a young child being on a recording they have also cautioned that jurors may be less likely to understand this in the case of an fi older child or adult who appears not to have any de ciency in communication or understanding CBA para d In this context they suggest that a complainant s making use of pre recorded evi dence including via s might confer an unintended advantage to the defence CBA para Recent research evaluating investigative and prosecutorial strategy in rape cases in England and Wales has further documented the tenacity of this perspective amongst many professional stakeholders but it has also highlighted the extent to which there may be a growing divergence of views on the matter as between those involved at earlier and later stages of the criminal justice process King et al On the one hand this research which included a series of interviews with stakeholders in policing the CPS and third sector as well as RASSO counsel and sex ticketed judges reported a common view amongst counsel and the judiciary that it is much more impactful for witnesses to give evidence face to face with the jury King et al However it also documented strong endorsement of the use of special measures amongst police and many prosecutors with the tensions this can provoke fl re ected poignantly in one comment by a CPS reviewing lawyer that I m sick and tired of judges and barristers saying that they want the victim in court behind a screen so the jury can see them cry and shake King et al The researchers noted that such tensions could be particularly acute in respect of s with barristers variously describing its use as dangerous dehumanising and doing a disservice to victims by allow ing juries to completely disassociate whilst CPS lawyers described it in line with the CPS s submission to the Justice Committee CPS a as revolutionary and brilliant King et al In reality the impact upon the jury resulting from the use of s by different categories of witness and in different types of trial remains uncertain Prior research much of it conducted with mock jurors via simulations given legal prohibitions on research that asks about the content of real jury deliberations has indicated that the removal of witnesses from the courtroom for example through use of live linked testimony could operate to increase the credibility of the complainant for some observers as much as it reduced their perceived credibility for others who found themselves feeling more detached Ellison and Munro Taylor and Joudo However this work has not typically explored the impact on jurors of the compound use of pre recorded evidence in chief through video recorded police interview alongside pre recorded cross examination which is the mode utilised under s Emerging research conducted in England and Wales exploring the effect of s on conviction rates fi has indicated the existence of a potentially signi cant impact and one that operates for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses alike in the direction of reducing the prospects for conviction when compared to live testimony Thomas para Indeed Thomas has reported that in the period from to the jury conviction rate was per cent lower overall in cases where s was used fi fi with this gure increasing in respect of speci c offence and witness categories including rape of a child aged to per cent and rape of a woman aged over per cent Thomas fi Table These ndings are stark but as Thomas acknowledges the extent to which they are best attrib uted to the mode of delivery per se or to the circumstances in which pre recorded evidence is currently operationalised and or additional barriers to credibility associated with witnesses for whom use of s may be necessary remains unclear Further work to explore the impact of s on jurors and thus to better understand what may be driving this apparent shift in conviction outcomes is ongoing Thomas In those cases where special measures including s are used however it will often be precisely because the individual witness is unlikely to be able to withstand giving testimony through conventional mediums or may be at risk of withdrawal from the process altogether if that were to be their only option Thus the counter factual against which the impact of use is to be measured is not one where the witness was necessarily present for or able to give clear and effective evidence live at trial This was emphasised by a Senior Crown Prosecutor C in our research who explained that any concerns around potential lower conviction rates in s cases needed to be contrasted with the fact Munro et al there s been a trial at all at least we ve had our prosecution at least she s had the chance to give evi fi dence In this context ndings from a recent project exploring changings forms and content of cross examination particularly in rape and sexual offences trials are also instructive Reporting that of the trials in which complainants relied on pre recorded cross examination only resulted in convictions the researchers noted it might be tempting to infer that video links do in practice impact negatively on fi juries They went on to underscore that all things however are not equal More speci cally they adjudged there were evidential weaknesses in the prosecution case in each and every one of the video link cases and noted there was also no higher a conviction rate within their sample of observations in cases involving screens relative to the cohort that relied on remote forms of court testimony Jackson et al Any data regarding the impact of s on conviction must also be situated in the context in which fi potential and realised bene ts to the experiences of complainants and witnesses are recognised which includes how the provision has been and currently is operationalised As discussed this is one in which numerous obstacles to best practice have been encountered Thus any negative fl effects on conviction rates linked to use of s might re ect the implementation gap that we expose in this article as much as the mode of delivery per se Indeed while Senior Crown Prosecutor C averred that defence lawyers never resist a s application which I think says a lot it is possible that this tells us far more about the shortfalls in how pre recorded evidence is cur rently captured and presented in the trial process than about its potential to empower witnesses to effectively communicate their account to jurors Certainly a number of interviewees expressed concern about the adequacy of the equipment used for capture and playback of s recordings within courtrooms It was suggested this could further dampen the effect C a RASSO barrister of complainants testimony because of poor audio and visual quality or a lack of integration across playback media Indeed a circuit judge J noted that issues with sound quality could be such that the jury might need to have a transcript or something fi just to follow it but this causes additional dif culties since such transcripts are not routinely avail able Playback failure was also reported The mother of a complainant in our study described the add itional stress caused when there were technical issues with her daughter s pre recorded evidence being played to the jury The playback wouldn t work on the day that they planned to do it just wouldn t playback and so then there fi was a lot of faf ng and then deciding what they were going to do then because obviously they couldn t do it in the order that they wanted and it just felt like really We ve waited all this time and now the videos don t work ISURF fi Technological issues of this sort have been identi ed as a consistent challenge in both Ministry of Justice process evaluations Baverstock Ward et al as well as in contemporaneous academic research exploring s s implementation Jackson et al Kyneswood and submissions by practitioners to the Justice Committee Inquiry CBA COEUS National Police Chiefs Council Roberts Though the scale of the funding challenges fi associated with improving court infrastructure and IT equipment to render it t for purpose cannot be underestimated the fact that the Government has pushed forward with roll out of s in the absence of a clear strategy for ensuring appropriate infrastructure investment and modernisation is in itself problematic In this context it is also worth noting that concerns about audio visual quality were not restricted to fi s recordings concerns were frequently expressed too about whether police ABE interviews were t for purpose see also McMillan and Thomas Westera et al A RASSO ticketed judge J fi provided an example of a witness being lmed against the background of a sunny window with the con sequence that the jury members could only see their silhouette J also explained the biggest problem is The International Journal of Evidence Proof fi not being able to hear complainants you can hear the police of cer loud and clear but because they don t want to mic up the witness I think probably because they don t want to appear too formal it often means you can t hear the witness properly Where witnesses make use of s they have already provided their evidence in chief through an ABE video recorded police interview The conjoined effect of poor quality recording and playback across both mediums may be particularly damaging poten tially reducing the ability of jurors to follow understand and connect with their testimony Thus as Kyneswood recently put it when drawing on her research into the operation of s for intimidated wit nesses in her submission to the Justice Committee Inquiry while judges and barristers are concerned that jurors may disconnect from video evidence or treat it like a soap opera there is a basis for arguing instead that the experience of viewing pre recorded testimony should be more like TV not less in the sense of demanding improved audio visual quality Kyneswood para The ongoing use of the ABE as evidence in chief in s cases was raised by the CPS in their recent Justice Committee submission who noted that an alternative would be to collect the victim or witness account by written statement or by video recorded interview but to then pre record both the examination in chief and the cross examination in one hearing CPS a see also COEUS para This may go some way towards addressing concerns about ABE quality which inter vening research on the prosecutorial handling of rape complaints in England and Wales has similarly con fi rmed to be frequent and well grounded with judges in particular variously describing ABEs as chaotic confusing appalling and abysmal King et al However it introduces alter native challenges for example by increasing scope for inconsistencies real or apparent to emerge across witnesses accounts and without substantial investment in the technology to store playback and display recordings to jurors in courtrooms such a move is also unlikely in itself to overcome all con cerns regarding poor audio visual quality and its consequences Other technological issues were reported by professional participants in our study most frequently asso ciated with the centralised system in place for recording storing and playing back s hearings Participants fl explained that the need to pre book a timeslot to record and playback a s hearing was impractical in ex fl ible and did not re ect the complex reality of hearings within the courts see also Jackson et al As a RASSO ticketed judge J put it the booking system is impracticable You know you have to book a particular slot So if anybody s delayed you re stuffed or if an issue arises a point of law or something like that if you lose your slot you miss your slot and that includes for playback as well J went on to explain that once a trial is listed playback slots need to be booked months in advance We have to decide now when it s going to be replayed to the jury and the trial is listed in July of next year so fi counsel have to sort out right who am I gonna call rst How long do I think they re gonna take Can we guarantee that we ll have a jury at o clock on the Monday morning Can we guarantee there won t be any issues of law that might arise or anything like that Even once a recording slot is booked and the s hearing completed a RASSO ticketed judge J fl re ected on how recordings in their court and the wider court premises have often failed my technol ogy fails more times than it doesn t We ve all had a non recorded recording and I ve only done four or fi fi ve of them Further dif culties were also raised by a RASSO barrister C in relation to accessing the recorded cross examination ahead of time to check that it s audible it s watchable there are no problems with it and to suggest any edits C said the process had been unnecessarily complicated with an fi awful lot of chasing and xing behind the scenes to secure access from the external provider who was responsible for retention of recordings and who was described by J a resident judge as fi useless C concluded that this had made an easy job unnecessarily dif cult Similar sentiments fl were also re ected in submissions made to the Justice Committee Inquiry with the s technology labelled as archaic by one RASSO barrister Roberts and the editing process described as onerous and time consuming by another Mushtaq Munro et al Silver bullets and second chances fi Notwithstanding the potential bene ts of s for witnesses in terms of recall avoidance of re traumatisation and recovery and irrespective of the extent to which resourcing logistical and techno logical challenges could be overcome to improve the measure s operation in practice a number of parti cipants were keen to underscore that its availability should not be framed as any kind of silver bullet to longstanding and much lamented challenges facing the investigation and prosecution of RASSO cases in England and Wales Behind such contributions was often an evident concern that the provision had fi been rolled out nationally to intimidated witnesses without suf cient consideration and this had been precipitated by political pressure to respond to the decline in charge and conviction rates and an asso fi ciated crisis in public con dence that had also prompted the End to End Rape Review in As a RASSO barrister in our study C put it the theory is great but again it s been politicised fi there s a desire for quick xes without anyone asking any awkward questions For many participants such awkward questions included demanding greater scrutiny of and account ability by police and the CPS in relation to the timeliness with which cases were investigated charged and built for prosecution and the appropriateness or otherwise of decisions made regarding disclosure strat egies and charging thresholds As one RASSO barrister C explained in regard to the early handling of cases by police there needs to be more resources in terms of the investigation that takes place com plaints are made and quite often they ll make the ABE video but then they won t charge someone for an age it s months before they get round to doing it because there simply aren t the resources In this context the push to expedite justice outcomes by bringing forward the point of complainants fi cross examination through s recordings could be argued to be wide of the more signi cant need to facilitate timely investigations Another RASSO prosecutor C recounted a case involving two child complainants who had waited months from the date of their ABE interviews before the case reached the court and counsel even had an opportunity to request cross examination via s They explained whilst it can be expedited effectively once it gets to the court what needs to be expedited is the whole process between complaint and charge the CPS and police have to put the resource into getting those cases expedited through the system It was suggested too by participants that the implica fi tions of this may be particularly signi cant in the context of adult intimidated witnesses given the nature of many such investigations involving contested claims regarding consent and the increased likelihood of them requiring more extensive disclosure As a RASSO ticketed judge J put it for example For many people and I m not talking or year olds for which I absolutely accept in those tiny tiny number of cases the idea that they can be cross examined sooner is obviously an advantage But actually if you think about downloading phones and checking Facebook and getting medical records and school records you re not going to get to a s hearing very much quicker than a properly run prosecution Across police forces and CPS areas in England and Wales there has been a concerted effort under the banner of Operation Soteria to improve the timeliness and effective progression of investigations and prosecutions in adult rape cases Evaluation of those initiatives indicates that a combination of increased use by police of Early Advice from the CPS to delineate the scope of reasonable lines of inquiry along side improved mechanisms for monitoring the completion of Action Plans and ensuring more effective escalation of concerns in cases where timeliness targets are not being met has ensured some improve ment King et al The structures that support this have now also been incorporated as stand ard practice in refreshed National Operating Models for rape launched by both police College of Policing and the CPS Crown Prosecution Service b in It is nevertheless abundantly fi clear that resourcing and capacity remain signi cant challenges and that without substantial and sustain able investment the prospects of continued improvement in relation to the timeliness of investigation charging decisions and trial preparation will be remote The introduction of s cannot therefore The International Journal of Evidence Proof fi offer any quick x solution to these deeply entrenched issues despite policy rhetoric which several par ticipants felt too often suggested otherwise fi Returning to the silver bullet analogy one of the key bene ts associated with s has been the potential for it to transform the tone content and experience of testimony giving As with all special mea sures s is intended to recognise and respond to the needs of the witness ameliorating where possible those aspects of giving testimony in an adversarial environment that are apt to cause distress This is par ticularly critical where these issues might be so acute as to prevent the witness from being able to give an effective account Research has demonstrated that such incursions into the adversarial norms of the court room are often welcomed by witnesses Burton et al an appreciation echoed by several of our participants However it is important to recall that changes to the timing and mode of cross examination do not in and of themselves bring changes to tone and content In respect of vulnerable and child wit nesses the standardised use of GRHs to consider the structure and length of cross examination and scru tinise questions in advance can ensure a more transformative effect for these complainants when giving evidence This was noted for example by a Chief Crown Prosecutor C who explained that I think fi the cross examination process tends to be more concise the bad old days when I rst started prosecuting fi this stuff you just don t see that you see more concise evidence given which I think is bene cial to all concerned However as noted above it is far from clear that a similar process is routinely undertaken in GRHs in respect of intimidated witnesses Jackson et al or that the majority of legal professionals would consider it necessary appropriate or feasible to do so Kyneswood para Indeed the CBA s submission to the Justice Committee suggested that not every case should require the defence fi to provide chapter and verse of the cross examination to the court and argued that speci cally in rela tion to a s witness or an adult who for all other purposes is capable save they are nervous about giving evidence which is often couched in terms of fear and distress there is little need for compelling counsel to provide questions in advance of the s hearing CBA para c ii and iii This framing of the distress encountered by such witnesses as often being about mere nerves at the prospect of giving testimony may well diminish inappropriately the potential for re traumatisation that fl researchers have suggested attends the adversarial trial process In so doing though it may also re ect fi the professional ambivalence that we have identi ed above regarding the appropriateness of s and asso ciated protections being made available to adult intimidated witnesses in the same way as for children and vulnerable witnesses Recent research observing the cross examination of adult intimidated witnesses in fi both s and non s sexual offences cases has identi ed certain substantive effects as a consequence of the use of pre recorded cross examination including a slower and calmer pace to counsels questioning as required to increase the prospects for effective video capture Kyneswood However that research has also indicated that the types of questions posed their tone substance and potential for re traumatisation remained largely unaffected Kyneswood para Meanwhile Jackson et al have recently reported that though hectoring of the witness was not a common feature in their trial observations the tactic of using comments disguised as questions was still common in cross examination even of vulnerable wit nesses and particularly so in respect of vulnerable adults where per cent of questions were determined to be declarative in form compared to less than per cent of questions to children under the age of Jackson et al and This highlights that the s measure may not be the panacea that it has sometimes been suggested to be particularly for intimidated witnesses Nevertheless in a context in which there are acknowledged challenges associated with securing con victions in RASSO cases tied amongst other things to victims reluctance to participate in an adversarial and intimidating criminal trial and concerns about the predictability and reliability of juror decision fi making there are further bene ts associated with the extended use of s in terms of facilitating a second chance at justice that should be acknowledged A Senior Crown Prosecutor C for example recounted experience with a recent rape case that did not qualify at the time for s provision in which a very weird really ropey jury returned as hung after sending questions to the judge during deliberations which indicated victim blaming of the complainant for getting into the taxi where she Munro et al was allegedly raped by the driver rather than walking home alone we went for a retrial and our com plainant about six weeks out from trial had a nervous breakdown she couldn t go through the process again and the case had to be abandoned but if there had been a s we would have never had that problem and that s a big deal While the frequency with which juries in rape cases will be unable to reach a verdict should not be overstated another Senior Crown Prosecutor C likewise observed that fi s can be bene cial in giving a second bite of the cherry if you like in such circumstances because we ve got the video interview and cross examination In its recent submission to the Justice Committee the CBA agreed that this ability to use a pre recorded cross examination in the event of a trial collapsing or a hung jury is one of the most compelling arguments in favour of s whilst also noting that the statutory basis for this was unclear with no bespoke rules of court in place to deal with its use in a retrial CBA para e This may raise complicated questions in cases where complainants wish to withdraw their support for or involvement in prosecutions after having given s evidence or where a trial involving s recordings has resulted in mixed verdicts Where complai nants remain supportive however this certainly provides an opportunity for seeking justice at retrial with fi less potential for re traumatisation and so may be signi cant fi Our ndings also suggest that though not perhaps what was envisaged when the special measure was fi rst created s can offer scope for additional innovation when seeking ways to improve complainants experiences and justice outcomes in the context of a justice system stretched to capacity A s lead judge J recounted for example a case that had to be cut short because the defendant had Covid and was unable to attend Although not initially a s case the judge explained I was really worried that the four young women in that case all vulnerable witnesses all under the age of eight een would potentially have to go all through this again and so I took the decision with the assistance of counsel that we would simply get their evidence in the can and we would do it by s which we did The additional trauma often experienced by complainants when trials are paused delayed or do not go ahead at the last minute is well known Burman and Brooks Hay Rape Crisis England and Wales While as discussed earlier there was scepticism amongst participants regarding the extent to which a blanket increase in the use of s by vulnerable and or intimidated witnesses would be likely to substantially reduce delays and backlogs as this example by J demonstrates it fl allows a degree of exibility that sometimes in unpredictable ways can be relied upon to avoid unneces sary and distressing ruptures in complainants justice journeys Conclusion As the Justice Committee continues to consider the submissions to its Inquiry into the operation of s of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act and research exploring the effects of its usage on case outcomes across England and Wales continues vulnerable and intimidated witnesses are required to fi evaluate ideally with the bene t of information and guidance from police prosecutors and specialist support or witness services the merits and demerits of making use of pre recorded cross examination There are inevitably a number of considerations to weigh in that balance It is clear that there are poten fi fi tially signi cant bene ts associated with the use of s for complainants and witnesses However there is also substantial variability in how s is operationalised and its use responded to by professionals and this maps amongst other things to the category of witness type of case level of scrutiny of questioning quality of technology courtroom infrastructure and listings or capacity challenges The long awaited implementation of s is in our view welcome and our discussion in this article should not be taken as supportive of moves to pause or abandon its usage But there is a legitimate basis for concern regarding the pace at which it has been rolled out the rigour of performance evaluations to date and the adequacy of its implementation The International Journal of Evidence Proof Whilst the principles underpinning the introduction of s are important and admirable and were supported by the majority of participants in this research it is clear that policy rhetoric has too often over reached in its claims around s as a silver bullet to the complex issues facing the investigation and prosecution of RASSO cases Indeed against the backdrop of a pronounced lack of investment in crim inal justice processes personnel and infrastructure in England and Wales along with acute challenges resulting from increased court backlogs and attrition of legal professionals at an unprecedented rate our research evidences a series of grounded practical and often legitimate concerns regarding the oper ationalising of s and indeed associated special measures such as ABE pre recorded police interviews The Ministry of Justice process evaluations focused predominantly on pilot courts have yielded some useful insight but as a RASSO ticketed judge J highlighted the problem with the roll out of s is that the courts that were the pilot courts were heavily funded with judges who I have enormous respect for but who verged on the zealot on the subject Further insights have also now been gleaned through evidence submitted to the recent Justice Committee Inquiry Nevertheless a more rounded evaluation is clearly still required one that pays close attention to the scale of variation between current potential and optimal modes of implementation as well as to the needs and experiences of witnesses in all their diver sity Without this we would argue that there is a risk of retreating too readily from use of s for fear of its unintended negative effects or conversely of pushing forward too enthusiastically notwithstanding the fi insuf ciency of supporting infrastructure and resource Either way the consequence will be as J put it that the story of s s design and implementation could become one of a a well meaning disaster for individuals and justice systems alike fl Declaration of con icting interests fl The authors declared no potential con icts

assault and sexual abuse has lifelong impacts for mental health and well being Prolonged Exposure PE Cognitive Processing Therapy CPT and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing EMDR are among the most common interventions offered to survivors to alleviate post traumatic stress disorder PTSD and other psychological impacts Beyond such trauma focused cognitive and behavioural approaches there is a range of low intensity interventions along with new and emerging non exposure based approaches trauma sensitive yoga Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories and Lifespan Integration This review presents a timely assessment of international evidence on any type of psychosocial intervention offered to individuals who experienced rape sexual assault or sexual abuse as adults Objectives To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on mental health and well being for survivors of rape sexual assault or sexual abuse experienced during adulthood Search methods In January we searched CENTRAL MEDLINE Embase other databases and three trials registers We also checked reference lists of included studies contacted authors and experts and ran forward citation searches Selection criteria Any study that allocated individuals or clusters of individuals by a random or quasi random method to a psychosocial intervention that promoted recovery and healing following exposure to rape sexual assault or sexual abuse in those aged years and above compared with no or minimal intervention usual care wait list pharmacological only or active comparison s We classified psychosocial interventions according to Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group s psychological therapies list Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood Review Copyright The Authors Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley Sons Ltd on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane Main results We included studies to with participants randomly assigned to experimental groups and inactive comparator conditions The experimental groups consisted of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy CBT behavioural interventions three integrative therapies three humanist five other psychologically oriented interventions and seven other psychosocial interventions Delivery involved to median sessions of traditional face to face or other individual formats four groups nine or involved computer only interaction six Most studies were conducted in the USA n two were from South Africa two from the Democratic Republic of the Congo with single studies from Australia Canada the Netherlands Spain Sweden and the UK Five studies did not disclose a funding source and all disclosed sources were public funding Participants were invited from a range of settings from the community through the media from universities and in places where people might seek help for their mental health e g war veterans in the aftermath of sexual trauma sexual assault centres and emergency departments or for problems that accompany the experience of sexual violence e g sexual health primary care clinics Participants randomised were women participants with just men Half were Black African or African American participants White Caucasian participants and represented a range of other ethnic backgrounds participants The weighted mean age was years standard deviation SD Eighty two per cent had experienced rape or sexual assault in adulthood Twenty two studies required fulfilling a measured PTSD diagnostic threshold for inclusion however of participants were reported as having clinically relevant PTSD symptoms at entry The comparison of psychosocial interventions with inactive controls detected that there may be a beneficial effect at post treatment favouring psychosocial interventions in reducing PTSD standardised mean difference SMD confidence interval CI to studies participants low certainty evidence large effect size based on Cohen s D and depression SMD CI to studies participants low certainty evidence large effect size Psychosocial interventions however may not increase the risk of dropout from treatment compared to controls with a risk ratio of CI to studies participants low certainty evidence Seven of the studies with participants comparing a psychosocial intervention to an inactive control reported on adverse events with events indicated Psychosocial interventions may not increase the risk of adverse events compared to controls with a risk ratio of CI to studies participants very low certainty evidence We conducted an assessment of risk of bias using the RoB tool on a total of reported results A high risk of bias affected of PTSD results for depression symptoms for treatment dropout and one third for adverse events The greatest sources of bias were problems with randomisation and missing outcome data Heterogeneity was also high ranging from I adverse events to I PTSD Authors conclusions Our review suggests that survivors of rape sexual violence and sexual abuse during adulthood may experience a large reduction in post treatment PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms after experiencing a psychosocial intervention relative to comparison groups Psychosocial interventions do not seem to increase dropout from treatment or adverse events effects compared to controls However the number of dropouts and study attrition were generally high potentially missing harms of exposure to interventions and or research participation Also the differential effects of specific intervention types needs further investigation We conclude that a range of behavioural and CBT based interventions may improve the mental health of survivors of rape sexual assault and sexual abuse in the short term Therefore the needs and preferences of individuals must be considered in selecting suitable approaches to therapy and support The primary outcome in this review focused on the post treatment period and the question about whether benefits are sustained over time persists However attaining such evidence from studies that lack an active comparison may be impractical and even unethical Thus we suggest that studies undertake head to head comparisons of different intervention types in particular of novel emerging therapies with one year plus follow up periods Additionally researchers should focus on the therapeutic benefits and costs for subpopulations such as male survivors and those living with complex PTSD P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y How helpful to recovery and healing are support and psychological interventions after exposure to sexual violence and abuse Key messages We found evidence that psychological or social collectively known as psychosocial interventions may reduce symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder PTSD and depression in survivors of rape sexual assault and abuse experienced during adulthood Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood Review Copyright The Authors Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley Sons Ltd on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Our review suggests that interventions did not worsen symptoms or lead to unwanted effects However as large numbers of participants dropped out of treatments or did not complete studies assessments these findings are unclear More recent studies were better at reporting information about participant safety and reasons why survivors did not complete treatments or health and wellbeing assessments after the interventions As the studies brought diverse groups of participants together future research is needed to improve understanding about which interventions are most suited to particular groups of survivors including those with long term or complex trauma as well as men and gender minorities Emerging interventions which have potential to expand treatment choices for survivors also warrant more evaluation What is sexual violence and abuse Sexual violence and abuse means any sexual activity or act that happened without consent It includes rape sexual assault sexual abuse and sexual harassment It causes emotional and physical health problems that can be long lasting The effects are often made worse by fear shame feelings of self blame and the negative responses of others How is sexual violence and abuse treated Survivors have a range of physical sexual health and forensic care needs in the aftermath of rape sexual assault or abuse Psychosocial interventions may be offered in response to these needs at different stages in survivors recovery journeys Some interventions aim to assist survivors by carefully re exposing them to aspects of the original trauma to process what happened e g Trauma focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy CBT Other treatments focus less on the traumatic memories instead helping survivors cope with life after abuse e g different forms of counselling education about mental health and support for a range of needs What did we want to find out We wanted to know whether psychosocial interventions help to relieve the mental health impact experienced by survivors as a result of rape sexual assault or sexual abuse in adulthood We also wanted to know if some types of interventions were more helpful than others What did we do We searched for studies comparing the effects of psychosocial interventions for individuals who had been subjected to rape sexual assault or sexual abuse from the age of years with a control group a group of participants who did not receive the intervention but instead were given their usual care were placed on a waiting list for treatment or received very minimal assistance such as leaflets We looked for differences between groups on trauma and depression symptoms after receiving the intervention dropout from interventions non completion and any unwanted effects related to the intervention or research About the studies and their participants We found studies that placed consenting adult participants by chance into an intervention or a control group Participants were invited from a range of settings community universities places where people seek help for their mental health sexual trauma e g specialist sexual assault centres and emergency departments or for problems that occur alongside the experience of sexual violence e g primary care clinics and via media requests The studies included survivors only were men Sixty per cent of participants were Black or from a minority ethnic or cultural background The average age was years and nearly all had symptoms of PTSD Most studies were done in the USA there were two from South Africa two from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and single studies from Australia Canada the Netherlands Spain Sweden and the UK Five studies did not disclose a funding source those that did reported public funding Over half the interventions were CBT based Support was mostly delivered one to one by trained mental health professionals and varied between and sessions What did we find Survivors who participate in a psychosocial intervention may experience a large reduction in PTSD and depression symptoms soon after the intervention is completed Non completion was not more common among survivors who experienced interventions compared to control groups but this was based on a small number of studies Psychosocial interventions may not increase the risk of unwanted effects Only seven studies reported unwanted effects suggesting most researchers may not have actively monitored the negative impacts of interventions or participation in the studies What are the limitations of the evidence We have little confidence in the results because of concerns about the level of variation across the studies e g types of survivor experiences wide range of interventions and study sizes It is possible that the allocation of survivors to one group or another may not have been entirely random Furthermore survivors who did not complete interventions or study assessments may have differed in important ways from survivors who did e g had better worse health problems Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during

Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews therefore less costly easier to deliver may be deliverable online To improve the certainty of the evidence larger samples are more feasible for survivors to access and scalable needed It is acknowledged that survivors of sexual violence and abuse are often minoritised and hard to reach multi site trials Implications for research which have been rare may alleviate some of these difficulties Over four fifths of participants in our review represented the target Some participants in the included studies had PTSD scores above a group however we believe that heterogeneity would improve by clinical threshold following treatment low intensity psychosocial incorporating sexual violence and abuse suffered in adulthood as interventions may not have reduced mental health problems and an inclusion criterion which is more common in recently published a third of those receiving exposure based interventions did not and ongoing trials The participants were diverse in age cultural complete treatment Thus there is a need for further evaluation and ethnic background indicators of deprivation education and of new interventions to improve mental health in this population employment However the research largely represents North We propose that future research includes high quality trials with America regard to these intervention types and other novel approaches such that in the future survivors can be offered a range of Given the female bias in

to usual care in health settings e g from sexual violence and abuse Furthermore strict study eligibility mental health services or primary care criteria may reduce the applicability of the research of those affected by complex PTSD and by severe mental health difficulties Many of the contemporary intervention types did not map easily It is understandable that safety and stabilisation of circumstances to the psychological therapies listed by former Cochrane groups are important for commencing PTSD treatments On the other CCDAN and CCMD based on our experience and feedback from hand efforts need to be made to avoid this leading to the exclusion experts researchers thus we recommend updating classification of certain groups in need of intervention The health inequality systems to allow greater confidence for example in standardising that faces people in this context with complex PTSD from migrant how interventions are grouped for subgroup analyses backgrounds those who are homeless and people with learning difficulties is reflected here in the exclusion of these groups from The majority of interventions we examined were delivered the research individually and face to

provide a community managed mech anism for savings loans and insurance for people who cannot access banks or microfinance in stitutions It was hypothesised that participation in VSLAs would provide women who lacked ac cess to financial services access to savings and loans in the safety of a trusted group It was also hypothesised that for women who had experienced sexual violence participation in the group based economic programme would improve their ability to care for themselves and contribute to their family s well being resulting in improved self efficacy and a reduction in mental health symptoms it was hypothesised that women who had experienced sexual violence would improve their social connectedness through being part of the economic group and that this together with increased

con ducted through interoceptive exposure to physiological reactions Exposure to panic symptoms decreases fear of physiological symptoms and also provides exposure to the physiological compo nent of fear associated with trauma thereby weakening the association of physiological arousal and the traumatic memory The interoceptive exposure is hypothesised to decrease fear of phys iological arousal symptoms experienced in panic and PTSD thus when exposed to traumatic memories and cues clients may be less fearful of physiological reactions Exposure to the cogni tive channel is conducted through writing assignments about the meaning of the trauma writings about the traumatic event itself and challenging cognitive distortions about how the trauma has affected safety trust esteem intimacy and power and control beliefs These components have been adapted from CPT Finally exposure to the behavioural channel is conducted through in vivo exposure to conditioned cues to the traumatic event

chronologic autobiographic memory Subsequently as the index trauma is transformed into an episodic memory anchored in a chronological timeline the limbic system stops perceiving the index trauma as a

for CPT clients and for each randomly chosen sessions were rated One of every rated sets of tapes was sent to a second rater for a reliability check Regarding adherence all unique and essential elements were included in all sessions and there were no violations of the protocols in which proscribed elements were introduced in therapy Intervention aim and theoretical basis CPT followed the format described by Resick with on ly a few minor modifications Session begins with education about PTSD an overview of treat ment and an assignment to write an impact statement about the personal meaning of the event After reading and discussing this in Session clients are introduced to the identification of and relationship among events thoughts and emotions At the end of Session clients are given the assignment of writing a detailed account of the trauma including sensory details thoughts and emotions They are encouraged to experience their emotions as they write their account and read it back to themselves This account is read to the therapist in Session and cognitive therapy begins with Socratic questions regarding self blame and other distortions The account is written and processed a second time in Session The focus of the therapy shifts to teaching clients to challenge and change their beliefs about the meaning of the event and the implications of the trauma for their lives From that point beginning with Session clients use worksheets that in corporate the earlier ones and are asked to develop and practice alternative more balanced self statements From Sessions to clients are asked to focus on theme each week safety trust power control esteem or intimacy and correct any overgeneralised beliefs related to that theme At the th session clients are also asked to

is deliberately redirected away from discussion of traumatic events PCT provides general support and education focused on current issues in the participant s life Emphasis is on prob lem solving and improving relationships with connections made between current problems and PTSD symptoms Like CPT PCT utilises a written component but in the form of daily journaling as opposed to written trauma

condition suicide attempt by overdose and psychiatric hospitalisations and adverse events in the PCT condi tion suicide attempt by overdose and psychiatric hospitalisation No events were deemed definitely study related however psychiatric hospitalisation in the CPT condition was deemed possibly related Although we did not collect data on causes of dropout we hypothesize that this is related to the fact that participants write their trauma narratives as homework for sessions and The writing of trauma narratives can be an especially challenging component of this thera py approach in terms of the emotional demands involved Dropping out of therapy is one method of avoidance coping when faced with distressing emotions or even the possibility of distressing emotions In addition to the emotional demands of directly confronting one s trauma CPT is also more demanding in terms of the mental focus and the homework required as opposed to the trauma free journaling of PCT which may have also contributed to the differential dropout be tween the treatment groups Discussion p Treatment dropout Outcome type dichotomous outcome Identification Sponsorship source Veterans Administration

numbers It states Hence over all the CAED sessions appeared to achieve the expected increase in negative affect Beyond this the study lacks specific information about recording of or actual adverse events and harms Bass There was no reference to any methods around assessing adverse events or harms Authors state We learned that it is possible to implement targeted strategies to include sexual violence survivors in VSLA groups in a safe and eth ical manner and that sexual violence survivors even those with severe trauma symptoms can benefit from this participation Bell The study lists a range of stressors that participants were exposed to during the study but does not provide numbers for these They make the point that many participants who were exposed to triggers and stressors reported feel ing lower levels of stress reactivity and enhanced levels of self regulation in re sponse to these stressors than they had prior to the study The study refers to how stressors may confound the findings and acknowledges triggering experi ences occurring in participants lives but does not give attention to harms aris ing from its interventions Notwithstanding this there was just

prolonged exposure TAU treatment as usual WA written account WE written exposure A P P E N D I C E S Appendix Appendix How the intervention might work Cognitive behavioural interventions are based on the proposition that behaviours are cognitively mediated Butler Mental health and social problems may be influenced by cognitions and resulting behaviours Because cognitive activity may be monitored and altered behaviours may be changed through cognitive changes Dobson Therefore interventions that address certain thinking patterns and beliefs may result in positive changes in symptoms problems and behaviours which may reduce some of the negative trauma related outcomes of rape or sexual assault Butler In the case of trauma theorists believe that the appraisal of fear involves the activation of trauma induced schema that lead the survivor to pay attention to information that is consistent with the schema and to ignore evidence that is inconsistent Resick This means that benign or ambiguous events can trigger a fear appraisal in trauma survivors Beck Hence cognitive theory as applied to the process of post traumatic stress disorder PTSD Veronen focuses on two processes changing a person s cognitive appraisal of the traumatic event or changing the process by which an individual attaches meaning to an event and changing a person s attribution of the event Coping skill treatments are designed to equip survivors with an array of skills to manage their trauma Some interventions are designed to be delivered within a short period of time following the assault or rape less than three months whereas others are used for survivors over the longer term The former is an attempt to provide prophylactic treatment to prevent chronic problems while others intend to facilitate faster recovery Vickerman Interventions for sexual assault and rape survivors typically employ a combination of approaches for example in the case of stress inoculation therapy prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy as outlined below Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood Review Copyright The Authors Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley Sons Ltd on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Stress inoculation therapy SIT was adapted Veronen from anxiety management procedures Meichenbaum It incorporates three elements behaviourally based psychoeducation so that survivors can understand and normalise fear and avoidance behaviours guided hierarchical in vivo assignments to target rape related phobias e g darkness and training in six behavioural and cognitive behavioural coping strategies which are thought stopping guided self dialogue muscle relaxation controlled breathing covert modelling and role playing The goal of SIT is to increase the survivor s awareness of conditioned stimuli to improve early detection of anxiety provoking cues which facilitates the use of coping skills early in the stress response to reduce anxiety Sherman Prolonged exposure therapy PET was developed from earlier treatments using flooding exposure techniques and emotion processing theory with patients with anxiety disorders Foa These techniques were extended by Foa and colleagues Foa Foa who argued that it is the encoding of memories under extreme distress that leads to disjointed and disorganised memories which impede natural recovery and lead to PTSD The aim of PET is to decrease the anxiety associated with rape memories PET begins with psychoeducation breathing training and the development of a fear and avoidance hierarchy for in vivo exposures In therapy people are asked to relive the rape scene and describe it aloud as they are imagining it using present tense and vivid detail which may be done several times in one therapy session The survivor s narrative is recorded and daily homework requires them to listen to their recorded account for further exposure Foa Cognitive processing therapy CPT was developed from emotional processing theory to identify a rape survivor s stuck points which are the parts of the traumatic narratives that cause them the greatest conflict Resick Resick These are manifestations of unsuccessful attempts to accommodate information in relation to the trauma into pre existing memory and belief structures The goal of CPT is to help individuals to integrate their trauma into pre existing schemas to decrease avoidance and intrusions of unintegrated aspects of the trauma Unlike PET CPT seeks to directly correct misconceptions or misinformation about trauma for example I m not safe anywhere or I can t trust anyone CPT also includes psychoeducation exposure and cognitive methods Exposure is achieved via the individual writing accounts of the rape and its meaning which they re read between sessions and writing about the impact of the trauma multiple times in order to incorporate new understandings and evaluation Therapy then addresses one of five themes safety trust power and control esteem and intimacy in each of the last five sessions via the use of cognitive restructuring worksheets Socratic questioning and discussion Behavioural therapies are based on the premise that all behaviours are learnt and therefore that unhealthy behaviours can be changed Techniques such as systematic desensitisation and flooding are often used with this population which emphasise the importance of extinguishing anxiety and reducing avoidant behaviours For example Foa and colleagues believe that exposure to the trauma allows mistaken evaluations and faulty stimulus response associations to be corrected Foa Foa Survivors are taught to replace a fear response with relaxation responses This can be done gradually with systematic desensitisation or more quickly via flooding Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing EMDR was developed by Shapiro for the treatment of PTSD It involves exposure elements and cognitive techniques In EMDR a scene is used to represent the entire trauma The survivor imagines the scene and recites words related to the scene while the therapist moves their fingers back and forth in front of the survivor so that the survivor performs rhythmic multi saccadic eye movements quick simultaneous movements of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction by watching the therapist s fingers This movement is argued to facilitate the processing of trauma memory through the dual attention required to focus on attending to the therapist s finger movement external stimulus and the trauma scene internal stimulus When the survivor s anxiety to the scene has decreased a new adaptive belief is rehearsed until this new belief feels true Rothbaum EMDR is similar to the behavioural techniques of flooding and systematic desensitisation Boudewyns a and studies comparing EMDR with and without eye movements suggest that EMDR without eye movements leads to equivalent outcomes as EDMR with eye movements Boudewyns b Pitman Third wave cognitive behavioural therapies e g acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness act on changing the function of psychological events and the individuals relationship to them through acceptance being present and committed action Hayes Counselling encompasses a range of interventions that may be employed by for example rape crisis centres Cryer Foa Resick Counselling can be premised on a number of approaches e g humanist psychodynamic and may be delivered as an intervention in itself or in combination with other approaches Counselling is likely to be very individually focused in order to discuss issues raised by the survivor and the necessary variation makes it difficult to specify exactly what is included in each session Humanistic and supportive therapies include an eclectic mix of therapeutic techniques Supportive therapy is almost always non directive that is the survivor is empowered to guide the content and the therapist avoids offering direct advice Cohen Deblinger The focus is on developing a supportive relationship between the therapist and participant Cohen Supportive therapy can be conducted in either an individual or group format Other psychologically orientated interventions include a diverse range of therapies that aim to help survivors cope with express and work through trauma through for example expressive writing Harte or mindfulness Brotto For instance equine assisted therapy for anxiety and post traumatic stress symptoms has been shown to reduce symptoms of post traumatic stress severe emotional responses to trauma

Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Psychosocial interventions include a wide range of interventions that target interpersonal social and environmental factors that relate to recovery from the trauma of rape and sexual assault in addition to or instead of the individual factors that are the focus of psychological therapies The way in which the

coping strategies and to encourage the use of the latter e g see Sikkema Group programmes and the provision of advisors or mentors provide social support these may be important given the stigma and

Systematic Reviews and and Records were screened for reports of RCTs within the scope of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Secondary reports of RCTs were tagged to the appropriate study record The CCMD CTR is current to June only Appendix Unused methods Randomised cross over trials Had we found cross over trials we would have applied the same approach as recommended in Section of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Higgins b As discussed in section in the Handbook this would involve using the variant of the Cochrane risk of bias tool designed specifically for cross over trials This would have helped address some of the key issues when assessing risk of bias in cross over trials including bias arising from the randomisation process bias due to deviations from intended interventions bias due to missing outcome data bias in measurement of the outcome and bias in selection of the reported outcome Continuous data Had studies used the same continuous outcome measure we would have calculated the mean difference MD with confidence interval CI We would have presented conceptually distinct outcomes in separate forest plots Had it been necessary to combine dichotomous data and continuous data in a meta analysis we would have needed estimates of the standard error Standard errors could have been computed for all studies by entering the data into RevMan as dichotomous and continuous outcome type data as appropriate and converting the CI for the resulting log odds ratios and standardised mean differences SMD into standard errors Lefebvre Once we had computed the SMD or log odds ratios and their standard errors for all studies in the meta analysis we would have combined them using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan Review Manager Cluster randomised trials There was one included cluster trial Bass however this was not included in the meta analysis due to the nature of the comparison Had we identified cluster randomised trials eligible for the meta analysis we would have adjusted the standard errors or sample sizes using the method described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Higgins b As described in section in the Handbook the adjustment method would have required the following information from the study the number of clusters or groups randomised to each intervention group and the total number of participants in the study the outcome data ignoring the cluster design for the total number of individuals and an estimation of intracluster or intraclass correlation coefficient ICC This would have enabled an approximately correct analysis to be performed Had the ICC not been available we would have used ICCs from analogous cluster randomised trials If analogous studies had not been available we would have used a series of plausible values in a sensitivity analysis An approximately correct analysis would proceed to reduce the size of each trial to its effective sample size by dividing by the design effect For continuous data only the sample size needs to be reduced For dichotomous data the number of participants and those experiencing the event should be divided by the same design effect Dealing with missing data We would have estimated the log rank statistics where these were not published in an article and we would have used previously reported methods where applicable Parmar Tierney We would have addressed the potential impact of missing outcome data in the risk of bias assessment If appropriate we would have performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the missing information on our results see Sensitivity analysis below using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Deeks Data synthesis Had it been inappropriate to combine the data in a meta analysis on account of insufficient studies or data we would have reported the effect sizes with CI or standard errors of individual studies and provided a narrative rather than quantitative summary of the findings that addressed the following aspects What was the direction of effect What was the size of effect Was the effect consistent across studies Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity As described in Chapter of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Deeks metaregression is an extension to subgroup analyses that allows the effect of continuous as well as categorical characteristics to be investigated and in principle allows the effects of multiple factors to be investigated simultaneously Generally metaregression should not be considered when there are fewer than studies in a meta analysis Had there been more than studies available we would have used metaregression techniques recommended for Stata Harbord Stata Participant characteristics have been identified as integral to subgroup analyses as there may be differences in the efficacy of treatments for different groups of individuals However we are aware that subgroup analyses of subsets of participants are challenged because sufficient details to extract data about separate participant types are seldom published in reports Recruitment setting has also been identified as important as there may be differences between survivors recruited via mental health clinics as opposed to in the community or acute sexual assault services Intensity of interventions is also of interest for example we might have compared outcomes from intense Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood Review Copyright The Authors Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley Sons Ltd on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews psychological therapies versus interventions oriented towards provision of psychosocial support Finally it would have been important to stratify analyses by type of intervention given their distinct mechanisms and theoretical underpinnings Had we found sufficient studies we would have conducted the following subgroup analyses participant characteristics e g gender ethnicity time to treatment symptom load and types of trauma exposure intensity of intervention e g up to four sessions five or more sessions mode of intervention delivery e g individual versus group and setting of recruitment or intervention delivery healthcare community acute settings Sensitivity analyses We would have performed the following sensitivity analysis provided there were sufficient numbers of studies to examine any effects on the overall outcome re analysis of the data excluding studies with missing outcome data Additional sensitivity analyses would have been required if particular issues related to the studies under review had arisen for example if ICCs were not available in included cluster trials or analogous cluster randomised trials we would have used a series of plausible values in a sensitivity analysis H I S T O R Y Protocol first published Issue C O N T R I B U T I O N S O F A U T

SIT Prolonged Exposure Therapy PET and Cognitive Processing Therapy CPT as examples of integrative therapies based on our reading of descriptions of these interventions in the literature we used to guide the development of our review However when we started to categorise the interventions identified in studies that met our review criteria we found that not all easily fit with categories of the former Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group CCDAN list of psychological therapies We therefore consulted experts and clinical psychologists for guidance and concluded that we had previously miscategorised SIT PET and CPT which may be better categorised as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy In addition trauma focused interventions compared to non trauma focused was an aspect we raised as important in the Protocol It is recognised that the main comparison combines all intervention types in one and that it may be more useful to stakeholders to understand effects by type Thus depending on availability of data we will stratify results using primary outcomes for CBT versus inactive controls and behavioural therapies versus inactive controls presenting these in additional tables However we had not clearly described trauma focused interventions in the Protocol Hence we edited the Description of the intervention section in light of our increased learning in the topic and our previous oversight and used these updated categorisations throughout the review In the Protocol we stated we would include all time points but that the primary time point for treatment efficacy would be three months post treatment The selection of this time point had been based on a scoping review done at the outset of the research However in the process of selecting studies for inclusion it became clear that the majority assessed treatment efficacy at post treatment in the days and weeks following treatment and three months was much less common We still conducted meta analyses based on the outcomes at three months however ultimately post treatment outcomes were reported in Summary of findings Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood Review Copyright The Authors Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley Sons Ltd on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration Cochrane Trusted evidence Informed decisions Library Better health Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews In the Protocol we intended to extract sexual identity but this was rarely mentioned in any study and was not ultimately listed among the characteristics of included studies In the Review we listed additional features for extraction than initially included in the Protocol These changes included adding information about interventions such as format of delivery theoretical basis for the intervention fidelity mean number of sessions taken up by participants and completion rates We were more precise in the review about the difference between dropout and non completion Dropout indicated the number of participants who did not complete outcome assessments evaluation Non completion referred to the number of participants allocated to an intervention group that did not receive the intervention or access a minimum number of intervention sessions predefined by individual studies as the dose required for completion We differentiated between study setting and recruitment setting These differences were implemented so that the data extracted accurately reflected what was reported in the included studies and could be synthesised across all studies The review unlike the protocol specifies a minimum number of included studies required to perform meta analyses We performed a meta analysis if there were three or more studies This was selected as a threshold given the potential for a very large number of analyses across our four time points and primary and secondary outcomes I N D E X T E R M S Medical Subject Headings MeSH

CREED AF intervention will involve a comprehensive programme of structured exercise training and risk factor modification delivered both before AF ablation prehabilitation and after AF ablation rehabilitation To ensure generalisability to the UK NHS the underpinning framework of the CREED AF exercise intervention is based on UK cardiopulmonary rehabili tation guidelines and service delivery models To maximise accessibility exercise will be delivered as a rolling programme Participants can immediately join existing cardio pulmo nary rehabilitation exercise programmes rather than waiting for the recruitment of sufficient numbers to form a discrete group The CREED AF intervention has components Component Individual assessment and exercise familiarisation Participants will be invited to attend an initial one to one appointment with a CREED AF practitioner for clinical assessment and appraisal of participant goals expectations fears concerns and barriers to change for modifiable risk factors During the first week of the intervention a one to one supervised gym based familiarisation exercise session will enable participants to build their confidence and allow practitioners to optimise exercise prescription Component Supervised exercise programme Familiarisation will be followed by a tai lored individualised exercise training programme comprising times weekly exercise for weeks before and weeks after AF ablation see Fig A two week intervention free period immediately post AF ablation will allow for femoral access site wound healing Exercise will be a combination of conventional gym exercise and functional fitness training and will be highly adaptable to allow for lower or higher ability participants whilst ensuring safety and efficacy Participants will have access to both in person sessions at the local cardiac rehabilita tion centre and instructor led live home exercise sessions that will take place in groups via video conferencing software Component AF

submission to the research ethics committee the study protocol and other patient fac ing documents have been reviewed by expert members in the field of cardiology and ablation The study was also presented to the Patient and Public Research Advisory Group PPRAG at UHCW to receive expert lay feedback on the study design and methodology Following engagement with the PPRAG at UHCW they were supportive of this project They recom mended that people who do not have access to video conferencing software smartphones or webcams be excluded due to the reliance on the live exercise sessions at

rehabilitation and education in atrial fibrillation ablation CREED AF Sample size The sample size calculation was based on the analysis of the change in the primary outcome relative VO at week post ablation from baseline Previous studies investigated peak VO at months post ablation which we assume to be similar at week post ablation peak Based on Kato et al we can assume that the VO standard deviation is around ml kg min peak at baseline and ml kg min at week post ablation As the correlation between the time points is unknown we assume a value of r Consequently the standard deviation of the difference from week post ablation to baseline is around ml kg min Based on Fiala et al and Mujovic et al we can assume that the change in VO will be around ml kg min due peak to AF ablation in both AF types and a further ml kg min due to cardiac rehabilitation which comprises pre and post AF ablation rehabilitation Therefore the differ ence between the intervention arm and standard care is expected to be ml kg min at week post ablation compared with baseline To detect a conservative difference of ml kg min an increase in ml kg min VO in the intervention arm from standard care at week post peak ablation compared with baseline at significance level and power we require par ticipants To allow a drop out rate of we will recruit people with randomly allo cated to each group Data analysis Demographics and baseline characteristics categorical data will be summarised as frequency and percentage continuous data will be summarised using the following descriptive statistics frequency total number of missing and non missing available for summary mean and stan dard deviation SD median th and th percentiles minimum and maximum by treat ment arm and as overall The primary outcome measure will be the difference in means between the two treatment arms by fitting a linear regression model where the relative VO at weeks post ablation peak is the response and the predictors are the relative VO at baseline and treatment arm We peak will adjust for other baseline measures e g AF type sex left ventricular ejection fraction and amiodarone use All participants with both relative VO at baseline and week post abla peak tion are the target population with those assigned to standard care through randomisation will be the control group and those to CREED AF intervention will be the active intervention group The intercurrent event that we expect is treatment discontinuation due to any reason and this will be addressed as treatment policy strategy We may also explore for any potential confounders in relative VO within the study and the complier averaged causal effect peak CACE analysis as a sensitivity analysis For secondary outcomes all the scoring of HRQoL AFEQT and SF will be computed as per the instrument algorithm The scores will then be summarised descriptively overall and by treatment arms at baseline and the short week and long term month follow up time points The change of HRQoL from baseline to week from baseline to month post ablation and the difference between treatment arms will be estimated with their associated confidence intervals CIs We will explore the HRQoL longitudinal effect by visualising the change against time Proportion of significant AF events by treatment arms will be esti mated with associated confidence interval CI using Kaplan Meier analysis Similarly the proportion of individual and composite MACE and its associated CI by treatment arms will be estimated The recurrence of AF burden from the Holter and each of the MACE occurrence will also be estimated by treatment arms as a time to event estimand We will also perform a subgroup analysis by types of AF persistent and paroxysmal AF for all endpoints Analysis

intention to treat basis Missing data will be accounted for by using appropriate techniques such as multiple imputation depending on the extent and type of missing items As cost distribution is skewed by existence of people with very high costs calculated mean per person costs will be provided with confidence intervals obtained through non parametric bootstrap methods We will perform an incremental analysis to calculate difference in costs and in outcomes associated with the compared options The findings will be presented as incremental cost effectiveness ratios reflecting the extra cost for additional units of outcome A sensitivity analyses will be done to assess impacts of differ ent assumptions on results Due to inherent uncertainty secondary to sampling variation the joint distribution of differences in cost and outcomes QALYs will be derived by perform ing non parametric bootstrap simulations The simulated costs and outcome pairs will be depicted on a cost effectiveness plane and plotted as cost effectiveness acceptability curves CEAC CEAC will show the probability of CREED AF being cost effective across a range of values of willingness to pay for an additional QALY Adverse event management In our study an adverse event AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence involving a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention or trial Adverse events will be collected only once the participant has provided consent and enrolled into the study Expected AEs related to the exercise outcome assessments or the exercise inter vention include normal levels for each individual of breathlessness light headedness dizzi ness muscle and joint stiffness soreness and tiredness fatigue There are a few AEs which are expected following AF ablation and occur after roughly of all AF ablation cases includ ing vascular injury pericardial effusion tamponade stroke transient ischaemic attack myo cardial infarction phrenic nerve injury atrioventricular heart block and pulmonary vein stenosis Because of the post AF ablation conditions there is a small risk of requiring further cardiac surgery or a blood transfusion Each AE will be assessed by the Chief Investiga tor or a delegated clinician to assess the causality to the CREED AF intervention In the unlikely event that it is decided that one of the above post AF ablation conditions is related to the CREED AF intervention this will be reported as such in line with local Trust policy and national safety reporting guidelines Expected AEs will be recorded on the participants case report form CRF AE form Any unexpected AEs related to the exercise outcome assess ments or the exercise intervention for all participants will be recorded on the CRF AE form logged and reported at trial management group TMG meetings Should multiples of the same unexpected AE occur during the trial period then this will trigger the TMG to review the study

any deterioration in condition and general care not associated with any deteri oration in condition SAEs will be collected from self report and from medical records checks Reportable SAEs in both groups will be any event occurring within hours of each assess ment appointment baseline and weeks weeks post AF ablation and in the interven tion group any event that occurs at any time between baseline outcomes assessment and the weeks weeks post AF ablation All SAEs will be recorded and reviewed by the Chief Inves tigator to determine if it is directly attributable to the intervention and investigated in line with the hospital Trusts standard operating procedure SOP Those SAEs that are deemed to be unexpected probably or definitely related to the trial interventions or outcomes assessments will be notified to the Research Ethics Committee within days and reported to the TMG at the next meeting Discussion AF is an increasingly prevalent arrhythmia independently associated with morbidity and mor tality In addition to pharmacological management catheter AF ablation is a recognised treat ment option However success rates for AF ablations are suboptimal and AF often recurs at longer term follow up This is often due to co morbidities and AF risk factors The benefits of supervised exercise training and AF risk factor management are increasingly being recognised Performing a relatively inexpensive prehabilitation and rehabilitation intervention CREED AF consisting of supervised exercise training and AF risk factor education modification may improve outcomes for people undergoing AF ablation Prehabilitation and rehabilitation are not routinely recommended for AF and emerging evidence has not been evaluated in large clin ical trials Exercise training and risk factor modification are of benefit in other cardiac popula tions and therefore could be of benefit to people with AF The CREED AF study will indicate whether larger multi centre trials for people with AF are warranted informing a potentially clinically and cost effective programme in line with NHS priorities for the long term manage ment of AF These findings will also be of interest to healthcare providers globally The question about athletes particularly high endurance level athletes was considered when planning and developing the research protocol for CREED AF The general consensus was to maintain generalizability of the study by being inclusive of as many individuals suffering with AF undergoing first time AF ablation It has been observed that high endurance athletes do also suffer with AF with reduced physical ability fitness prior to ablation and improvements in lev els of fitness exertion after AF ablation The application of CREED AF intervention which aims at delivering a moderate level of exercise tailored to the individual alongside risk factor management is equally applicable in these participants Furthermore the primary outcome measure is mean change in VO from baseline to primary follow up at weeks post peak AF ablation in the two groups measuring and comparing the change within the same individu als will minimize any bias if any derived by inclusion of athletes Trial status The CREED AF study started recruitment as of December and is expected to finish recruitment by February Monitoring audit inspection The study may be monitored by the Research

Background Self monitoring of behavior namely diet and physical activity and physiology namely glucose has been shown to be effective in type diabetes T D and prediabetes prevention By combining self monitoring technologies the acute physiological consequences of behaviors could be shown prompting greater consideration to physical activity levels today which impact the risk of developing diabetes years or decades later However until recently commercially available technologies have not been able to show individuals the health benefits of being physically active Objective The objective of this study was to examine the usage feasibility and acceptability of behavioral and physiological self monitoring technologies in individuals at risk of developing T D Methods A total of adults aged years and at moderate to high risk of T D were recruited to take part in a arm feasibility trial Each participant was provided with a behavioral Fitbit Charge and physiological FreeStyle Libre flash glucose

physical activity feedback weeks followed by biobehavioral feedback weeks group or biobehavioral feedback weeks group Participant usage including time spent on the apps and number of glucose scans was the primary outcome Secondary outcomes were the feasibility including recruitment and number of sensor displacements and acceptability including monitor wear time of the intervention Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at the week follow up appointment Results For usage time spent on the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre apps declined over the weeks for all groups Of the FreeStyle Libre sensor scans conducted by participants recorded rising or falling trends in glucose and of participants changed of the physical activity goals For feasibility of participants completed the study using the minimum number of FreeStyle Libre sensors and a total of sensors were declared faulty or displaced For acceptability participants wore the Fitbit for SD days and of participants and of participants were prompted by email to charge or sync the Fitbit respectively Interviews unearthed participant perceptions on the study design by suggesting refinements to the eligibility criteria and

fine though I think it s brilliant I forgot it was even there and in fact I m a bit lost without it now Participants evaluated the technologies a main theme and it s not there it is quite strange female GPA discussed the usability wearability reliability durability preferences privacy and cost as subthemes Additional quotes It was more about that but when I had the glucose to support the described subthemes are presented in Multimedia monitor on for a start when it was hot I put Appendix sleeveless on but then I was getting what s that what s that what s that So I started wearing things Usability with just sleeves on female PA GPA Participants generally found both technologies easy to use in Because I have got all these lovely watches at home particular how they found the Fitbit easy to charge and were that I can t wear because I have got that Somebody complimentary about the battery life Comments relating to at work has got one of those on I noticed she has got applying the FreeStyle Libre emphasized the initial trepidation it on her other hand She has got her watch on one felt by the participants mostly because of the visible needle hand and her Fitbit on other hand I thought well and concern that the insertion process would be painful across that s one way of doing it But I couldn t wear it on all groups However there was a pleasant surprise with which there female GPA the FreeStyle Libre adhered to the skin and this nervousness typically subsided following the first application The Reliability requirement of scanning the FreeStyle Libre at least every Some participants questioned the glucose level provided by the hours to avoid data loss was highlighted as a flaw with the FreeStyle Libre when it classified them as low or in the red technology as some participants forgot to scan regularly enough when this was not normally the case They tended to attribute and several participants noticed periods of missing data during this observation to the timing of using a new sensor or altering sleep the location of the FreeStyle Libre on the arm When talking I thought it was all very straightforward all very easy about the Fitbit the accuracy of the data provided by the female GPA technology was questioned by the participants across all groups specifically for step count calories distance mode of I can take it off at night and charge it at night so activity stairs climbed heart rate and sleep During masked there s no issues with that I put it on charge every Fitbit wear very few problems with automatic syncing were second night really Charging a Fitbit lasts about five revealed but during unmasked periods many participants days so if I put it on every second night it was fine reported the need for multiple attempts at manually syncing the never had no issues with it running out at all male Fitbit Similarly multiple attempts were sometimes needed to PA GPA scan the FreeStyle Libre I was pleasantly surprised that it didn t hurt When I I think when I first got it it was quite low actually for first saw the thing I thought God this is going to be the first well for the first day it was below the and awful and hurt my arm but I couldn t believe how I was thinking ooh but then it went down to the normal painless it was female GPA sort of range And actually the last one a week ago When you go to sleep seven hours isn t all that long and the same thing actually that s been lower I don t really You generally need more than seven hours know if it s the device or if I ve done something sleep and not everybody would wake up in the night different or what female G GPA I do but not everybody would so that wasn t quite I think sometimes it s been quite generous with steps long enough female GPA Turning around to get the towel is giving me steps Wearability and some days it said you ve walked x miles and I thought I can t have Some days it s told me I ve The majority of the participants found the FreeStyle Libre walked eleven miles and I thought have I walked comfortable with many forgetting the sensor was there eleven miles Eleven miles is quite a so I m not particularly participants in groups G GPA and GPA A few sure it s accurate to that extent male G GPA indicated issues with skin irritation from the Tegaderm and having trouble applying the sensor correctly The issues with I had a couple of issues sometimes it s a bit difficult the wearability of the sensor appear to relate more to participants to link it to my phone it just takes a bit of being self conscious about wearing the sensor with some perseverance rather than everything happening on resorting to covering it up with additional or alternative clothing one flick of the screen it might take two or three and others suggesting refinements to the sensor and Tegaderm minutes just to catch on the Bluetooth It s not a major Similarly participants across all groups noted that the design issue it s just a little niggle that s probably a better of the Fitbit could be improved In particular participants word male PA GPA suggested aligning the design with traditional watches and for Durability some this issue meant they were not pleased when asked to replace their existing jewelry with the Fitbit Reasons for Several participants spoke about their experience of having the discomfort were also related to the impact of temperature on FreeStyle Libre sensor fall off and in part this was because the Fitbit strap they were getting less aware of wearing it as time went on more http mhealth jmir org e JMIR Mhealth Uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purposes XSL FO RenderX JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Whelan et al so for participants in G GPA and GPA Particular reasons note when you had eaten something So you could then align I mean in the end you didn t really need reported by participants included walking into door frames to because you could see the patterns for yourself catching the FreeStyle Libre sensor on clothing or showers and but to start with that s useful that you could put in perspiration weakening the sensor s attachment Participants when you had eaten something Or put a note in of also raised annoyances about the memory of the FreeStyle Libre some sort which is helpful female PA GPA suggesting that the memory is not sufficient and perhaps if it lasted a day or two it would avoid some of the data losses as I have actually enjoyed the glucose monitor results some participants kept forgetting to scan it regularly looking at the graphs and charts more than the Fitbit female GPA I caught one on the car doorframe when I was getting something in and out of the car The other one I I could have delved a lot more deeply into the Fitbit walked into a doorframe and caught it and it just bent but I was more interested in the app and the glucose the needle and it stopped working male GPA levels I ve never monitored my glucose before and I was fascinated by the whole thing I was amazed I thought it might have a better memory last a day how the device worked and all sorts of things about or two but because I kept forgetting to because I am it male G GPA so busy I just kept forgetting to scan it so there are gaps and also at night time I go to bed like Cost o clock at night time and then get up sort of hours Several participants expressed their concern about the cost of later after a really good sleep and there are huge the FreeStyle Libre sensors if they were to buy them in gaps male G GPA particular because they only last weeks which would restrict Privacy many people from accessing this technology Participants discussed the topic of privacy explaining how they It is a lot I am sure they will come down as people did not mind or have any problems with having data collected use them more and more but and they only last two on how much they used their phone and the study apps during weeks so you know it is a lot of money female the study period Some participants mentioned that this was PA GPA mainly because they had nothing to hide Others raised concerns Acceptability of the Technology Quantitative Insights about other apps and their monitoring activities such as Google Maps which captures a lot of information about user location During the weeks of participants provided days of valid Fitbit wear with all participants averaging a total It was interesting that you could have all this stuff of SD valid days Compliance with syncing the Fitbit going on on your phone but it also is a bit spooky as data noted that participants received a prompt from well because people are watching your performance the researchers to sync encourage data transfer whereas I suppose that in real life can be quite scary It is and participants received anyway you don t know who s watching you at any or prompts respectively In terms of charging the point female GPA Fitbit participants received a prompt to charge the Preference Fitbit as battery status reached No data losses were recorded for the Fitbit across the groups The level of data Participants described accessing an array of feedback metrics capture for the FreeStyle Libre was high an average of for their activity Preferred Fitbit features were typically step SD and SD in the first and sixth week count and heart rate with calories burned considered the least respectively and this was relatively consistent between the meaningful There were conflicting remarks about the Fitbit groups Multimedia Appendix prompts the associated motivational messages were seen as childish and receiving the notification to move hourly was There was no clear trend toward increased physical activity over deemed too frequent Nonphysical activity features such as food the weeks using step count active minutes number of flights logging and relaxation were not used as often or considered as of stairs or reductions in the number of reminders to move useful as the physical activity features of the Fitbit This was Multimedia Appendix Similarly there was no improvement typically because of the manual entering of data required on the in interstitial glucose levels using time in range Multimedia app or preference for using alternative apps The FreeStyle Libre Appendix features were talked about positively by participants with no Acceptability of the Trial Qualitative Insights clear preferences for the feedback provided A suggested improvement was for greater flexibility in viewing historical Participants evaluated the study design a main data There was an overall preference toward the FreeStyle Libre theme specifically having a positive experience wanting compared with the Fitbit mostly because of the novelty of full access to feedback in particular participants in the groups monitoring glucose levels regardless of group G GPA and PA GPA indicating the study duration being too short having issues with the eligibility criteria and being I d quite often look at my heartbeat because that was uncertain of what was expected of them as subthemes the most interesting thing on there male GPA Additional quotes to support the described subthemes are It gives you those daily reports which are helpful presented in Multimedia Appendix And I thought it was helpful that you could add in a http mhealth jmir org e JMIR Mhealth Uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purposes XSL FO RenderX JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Whelan et al There was an overall sense of positivity in taking part in the suggested that receiving more instructions on how to use and study Indeed participants wanted access to the information interpret the feedback would have been useful whereas others provided by the technologies with some explaining their were happy about not being given too much guidance and felt frustration of having devices masked and others describing their that the instructions given were clear That said participants disappointment with not being in GPA The week duration explained how explicitly being told to be more active or to eat differently would have left them better placed to act on the of the study was deemed not long enough by some participants feedback Other suggestions included directing people to sources to gain a full understanding of the relationship between their of information and being able to compare their glucose levels lifestyle and glucose represent normal life set more challenging against a healthy profile via the FreeStyle Libre app Fitbit goals or try out different wear locations for the FreeStyle Libre Perhaps a bit more detailed again just how to just sort of really make the best use of it would be better I really enjoyed it I really learned a lot from it male female PA GPA G GPA There s not really that much information to go with Yes I was really pleased that I was in the six week the monitor to tell you how to interpret the data group because I thought that will give me a lot to go male GPA on whereas two weeks is kind of neither here nor there I thought six weeks is a reasonable amount of But the researcher did say at the start use this as time to assess things I thought that was good for me you want it s your your thing to use as you want So and it led me to sort of draw some conclusions about that was good male G GPA glucose and how I was using it female GPA Technology Usage It is difficult to do that over six weeks Perhaps over From weeks to the groups G GPA and GPA spent a lower several months you might be able to pin it down to what you eat and when you eat it Perhaps keeping a amount of time on the FreeStyle Libre app going from to food and exercise diary and linking them together min per day and to min per day respectively but we weren t asked to do that female GPA Table PA GPA participants logged min per day in week and min per day in week A similar pattern was Some participants suggested that the FreeStyle Libre might be observed for the FreeStyle Libre app whereby participants in better suited to individuals at greater risk of developing T D groups PA GPA and GPA observed a reduction in time spent or people already with a diagnosis of diabetes Only including on the Fitbit app reducing from to min per day and individuals with a compatible Android smartphone was to min per day respectively Similarly participants in highlighted as an important limitation of the study G GPA reduced their app usage from weeks to from I said to the researcher you would have to change to min per day the only weeks when they could access it what app you use or something because I think you potentially would get a lot more people involved with The average number of scans declined over time across all it if it was compatible with an iPhone as well female groups Figure In the groups G GPA and GPA participants GPA logged on average scans per day in week and scans per day in week Across weeks and participants in There was uncertainty on fronts changing behavior and PA GPA

industrial Principal Findings and research sectors to collectively consider when considering the use of commercially available technologies in health To the authors knowledge this is the first study to deploy both research These include the following the need to integrate behavioral and physiological self monitoring digital health or facilitate the integration of information collected by technologies to individuals at risk of developing T D Use of behavioral and physiological sensors into a single platform and the devices reduced over the week intervention period but provide intelligent feedback and automated actionable remained higher than the minimum level of use needed to avoid insights by using multiple data sources in real time data loss eg scanning the FreeStyle Libre every hours Despite limitations with smartphone compatibility it was Technology Usage feasible to conduct the study with a high uptake rate and full Participants were given minimal instruction as to how to engage retention of participants at the end of the trial The study and with the technologies in an effort to reflect an off the shelf technologies were acceptable to individuals at risk of T D deployment There was reduced use of the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre over the week intervention period which was similar between the groups This suggests that the provision of both http mhealth jmir org e JMIR Mhealth Uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purposes XSL FO RenderX JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Whelan et al technologies did not clearly impact the honeymoon period or which is where further technological development may still the novelty effect frequently observed when people newly access play a key role digital health technologies For the FreeStyle Libre the Feasibility of the Trial and Technology magnitude of this novelty effect was different between time Eligibility of individuals completing the Web based risk survey spent on the app and the frequency of scanning Scans per day was low with of those who were ineligible for the reduced by approximately between week and week study classified as having a low risk of developing T D and whereas time spent on the app decreased by to for having a noncompatible smartphone Therefore this both groups accessing the FreeStyle Libre for the full weeks recruitment approach mostly attracted the worried well and may With participants expressing preference for more simple benefit from more targeted strategies such as recruiting from feedback features these data suggest that participants ended up primary care records that have identified to of preferring to simply scan and see their current glucose levels screened individuals presenting with impaired glucose regulation rather than delve into the more detailed feedback that could be However since study completion the FreeStyle Libre seen by the Freestyle Libre app This appeared to happen is now compatible with iOS devices eliminating the limitation once users were content with the instant and perhaps more of smartphone compatibility that excluded many otherwise understandable feedback provided with each scan eligible survey responders This was also highlighted by Stand alone telemonitoring systems are an encouraging tool to participants as a huge barrier to recruitment and a source of support motivation The dual deployment of physical selection bias That said once recruited all participants activity and physiological monitors succumbing to the issues completed the study describing their experience of taking part of disuse may have been because of the feedback sources treated as a positive one as distinct entities with distinct purposes It has been noted Characteristics of the participants also offer important insights elsewhere that relationships between behavior and health vary into the appropriateness of the recruitment strategy and in how easily they can be detected by the individual This eligibility criteria Although most participants were classified means that it may be more difficult for people to notice the as overweight or obese and did not meet physical activity benefits of being more physically active or having better blood recommendations less than one fifth of the sample was deemed sugar control compared with for example improving asthma at high risk only were prediabetic and there was significant medication adherence to relieve acute episodes of breathlessness ethnic homogeneity with almost of the sample being white British despite recruiting from an area with a multi ethnic A potentially helpful technological development would be to population This is particularly important given that South Asian combine and relate the feedback provided by the Fitbit and adults are times more likely to develop T D than white FreeStyle Libre or other similar devices into a single module British adults Therefore the next trial must actively seek or feedback interface to better represent the acute relationship more at risk communities After experiencing the FreeStyle between behavior and physiology With such integration the Libre for at least a couple of weeks many participants saw the technology may be more equipped to identify display and glucose monitor as having great potential for people diagnosed describe teachable moments such as the walk you have just with T D The FreeStyle Libre has since been made available taken after eating bought your blood sugar back down to on prescription by the NHS for people who meet a clear criterion baseline minutes faster than if you had stayed sitting down including currently undertake intensive monitoring times Elsewhere teachable moments have been defined as naturally daily and have an impaired awareness of hypoglycemia with occurring events that may motivate individuals to adopt positive nationwide availability from April risk reducing behaviors However the authors propose that Participants expressed the need for further instruction and to display feedback showing the physiological consequences demonstration of the technologies and assistance with of behavior it might need to be handled in a slightly different interpreting the feedback The reported uncertainty about way to make it meaningful to the individual Previous studies engaging with the technologies and hesitation in changing have used glucose monitoring technology to show behavior clearly demonstrate that simply providing people with activity related reductions in glucose to adults living with T D digital health technologies is insufficient for proactive lifestyle The development of such biobehavioral feedback messages modification Although this was not the primary aim of will require sophisticated real time machine learning techniques the study the minimal guidance approach to the study has to capture and process data to produce appropriate notifications illuminated important issues with using sophisticated digital to users in an accurate and timely manner Another provision devices in this way The need for a human element in such of teachable moments would be to demonstrate these prevention approaches to provide education demonstrate relationships under controlled conditions The positive impact devices prescribe exercise or motivate individuals to make of physical activity bouts on acute health in the laboratory positive lifestyle changes is something current digital health setting has been demonstrated and can highlight key technologies cannot replicate or replace In part this may be stimulus response events Bailey et al used intermittent because interfaces are not adequately intuitive or because data continuous glucose monitoring to show individuals with are not easily interpretable Interviewees expressed difficulty prediabetes and T D their blood glucose as a tool to increase knowing whether their glucose pattern was normal and what adherence to an exercise program over weeks However this approaches they should take to improve it Similarly many approach would not be currently feasible at the population level features of the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre went unexplored or http mhealth jmir org e JMIR Mhealth Uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purposes XSL FO RenderX JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Whelan et al were regarded as surplus Participants tended to focus on Strengths and Limitations features regarded as more palatable such as step count and heart SIGNAL was the first study to deploy self monitoring wearable rate which are often featured in wearable technologies technologies presenting behavioral and physiological feedback Therefore with ever more sophisticated commercially available in real time to individuals at risk of developing T D classified devices important challenges are to ensure the information using a validated screening questionnaire The mixed methods provided to users is easily accessible intuitive and actionable design of the trial enabled real life context to be applied to quantitative data permitting a more in depth assessment of Acceptability of the Trial and Technology participant s perspectives toward the study design and digital The technologies were perceived as comfortable and easy to health technologies The group allocations allowed all use and there was much positivity around participants participants to experience feedback from both devices adding experience of the study with some criticisms of the trial design to the breadth of experiences contributing to insights from the linked to wanting the study to last for longer than weeks as qualitative interviews The objective measurement of physical well as disappointment in not receiving the combined feedback activity allowed the sample to be compared against UK physical for the full length of the intervention period ie being allocated activity guidelines to GPA Adherence to wearing the Fitbit was excellent as In addition to the limitations previously disclosed the study was charging compliance However issues with syncing the had a relatively small sample size limiting insight from Fitbit data left participants frustrated and led the authors to statistical analyses Assessor and participant blinding to group conclude that syncing events should be interpreted with caution allocations was not possible In addition it was not possible to and were not a suitable measure of usage quantify what participants specifically looked at within the Fitbit The reliability of the feedback was also bought into question and FreeStyle Libre apps Owing to its main purpose as an particularly the numbers presented by the Fitbit which seemed intervention tool it was not possible to set up the FreeStyle to classify extraneous arm movements as steps A comparison Libre in a masked mode as achieved with the Fitbit of baseline step count values from the Fitbit and research grade Consequently no glucose data were collected from the ActiGraph may suggest an overestimation from the Fitbit PA GPA group for the first weeks of the intervention period Commercially available monitors have shown strong correlations Other studies have used the FreeStyle Libre Pro model that only with research grade accelerometers but this does not mean has a logging mode but is not currently available in all countries numbers can be directly compared Consequently this perceived or real overestimation may partly explain the lack of a clear change in physical activity from baseline because of the potential Conclusions for a false sense of achievement Similar notions although to SIGNAL to the authors knowledge was the first study to a lesser extent were made for the FreeStyle Libre Some explore levels of use when providing combined behavioral and participants noticed interdevice variability and the occasional physiological self monitoring wearable technologies to need for multiple scanning attempts but most issues were related individuals at risk of developing T D This study highlights to the visibility of the FreeStyle Libre and the aesthetics of the several important areas for future research notably the device itself The most common complaint of the FreeStyle inclusion of a more diverse pool of individuals at risk of Libre was its durability as supported by more than half of the developing T D or identified as living with prediabetes and participants requiring at least one additional sensor Previous the detection and presentation of teachable moments linking studies using the FreeStyle Libre have also noted concerns with behavioral choices with acute physiological consequences to the adhesion of the sensors and have highlighted instances of individuals in controlled and free living settings Improvements mild skin irritation and bruising often linked to medical grade to the usability wearability reliability and durability are needed adhesives Efforts to avoid the need for additional sensors before such approaches to disease prevention can be are needed to minimize disruption for patients and costs to the implemented into routine health care However issues around NHS the integration of feedback from multiple sensors and the need for real time actionable feedback need to be resolved for any future trials Acknowledgments This study was funded in part by philanthropic support received from the

developing collective leadership positive work environments and a culture of Excellence which align with the vision of the CNO for England Six pillars of Excellence have emerged through the MREN namely shared professional decision making local accreditation meaningful recognition distributed leadership continuous quality improvement and research and innovation The study was co created through the MREN and NHSE regional and national strategic partners during December to build on the existing knowledge Aims To describe approaches to Nursing and Midwifery Excellence in acute provider settings and explore the potential transferability of these to non acute provider settings To explore behaviours that drive Excellence to provide recommendations shaping approaches to Excellence and opportunities for further study Methods A mixed methods design was employed commencing with a literature review scoping method to explore the available evidence a staff survey administered via QR code using MS Forms online Office case study interviews with acute providers via MS Teams interviews with non acute providers via MS Teams and an exploration of key metrics determining impacts of Excellence in improving care quality and staff outcomes The six pillars of Excellence formed a framework throughout the study and was also guided by the COM B model of behavioural change which proposes three necessary components of behaviour namely Capability Opportunity and Motivation s In this study behaviours associated with achieving Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery were reported Forty four organisations across the Midlands were invited to participate Key Findings Twenty six organisations responded to the online survey Twelve acute organisations participated in case study interviews and three non acute organisations participated in interviews to explore transferability of findings to such settings The literature review identified studies from the USA with one each from Denmark Iran and Philippines Sixteen of the studies focused on formal accreditation through the Magnet Recognition Programme This programme is endorsed by the American Nurses Credentialing Centre and uses a set of criteria to bring about continual transformation and improvement towards nursing and midwifery excellence The case study interviews with acute provider organisations demonstrated how the pillars of Excellence are evident across the Midlands region Final version December Page of Professional leadership and organisational culture are two key factors identified in creating conditions for behavioural change and continuous improvement Some of the guiding principles for Excellence were found within some non acute organisations taking part in the interviews Non acute provider organisations demonstrated a willingness to adopt Excellence approaches and cultural readiness for change transferability of excellence Higher workforce stability and lower leaver rates were found in those organisations employing Excellence approaches compared to those who did not use these approaches Conclusion This study identified well developed approaches across the Midlands region Key factors driving Excellence behaviours and culture identified the benefits of implementing the pillars of Excellence and demonstrated that Excellence where adopted has a positive impact on workforce stability and turnover rates Non acute organisations are at an earlier stage of development of Excellence approaches and are open to exploration adoption and co production Recommendations The following recommendations are informed by study findings and help build on the national Excellence work to determine what Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery looks like and to transfer initiatives into non acute settings There is scope for organisational regional and national strategic leaders to shape work based on these recommendations Disseminate findings and share learning with key stakeholders including the MREN and relevant national networks This will ensure the study findings inform future work Prepare leaders to develop implement and sustain Excellence as part of organisational culture Strategic leaders are key to the success of the regional and national Excellence work they can use their influence to role model positive attitudes towards continuous improvement prioritise the development of positive practice environments and set out strategic priorities aligned to national Excellence ambitions Co develop with non acute organisations through the MREN an Excellence framework and delivery plan for non acute settings Identify dedicated leads from these organisations to champion the work This will enable co design and opportunities for learning and support Continue to drive forward the Excellence agenda using an evidence based approach informed by research and robust methodology and co creation This approach adds to the national evidence base and engages key stakeholders Consider alignment of the six pillars of Excellence to the national strategy Final version December Page of As the first study to explore Excellence within the Midlands there is much more that needs to be understood Further research is warranted to explore the gaps identified by this study such as o Including a wider geographical range e g England wide o Scoping transferability into other health and social care settings o Understanding the experiences of direct care nurses and midwives through the lens of the Excellence framework o Exploring the experiences of patients and families through care quality and improved outcomes o Exploring shared professional decision making as an approach to drive Equality Diversity and Inclusion EDI initiatives o Conducting face to face interviews to allow richer data collection o Identifying nursing and midwifery specific parameters to understand the direct impacts of Excellence o Identifying the impact of Excellence on workforce including recruitment retention and succession planning o Identifying the impact of Excellence on productivity and efficiency Final version December Page of Report The DEFiNe Study Determining Excellence Factors in Nursing and Midwifery Final version December Page of INTRODUCTION The Chief Nursing Officer CNO for England s vision for Nursing and Midwifery Excellence described herein as Excellence includes establishing a national collective leadership model with a focus on transformational leadership research and innovation The evidence suggests that these factors positively influence staff satisfaction and are key factors in promoting positive workplace environments Transformational leadership behaviour enables direct care staff to innovate through the use of quality improvement QI approaches and is linked to improved quality of care and patient outcomes Staff and patients benefit from environments with positive workplace and organisational cultures with staff demonstrating higher rates of engagement job satisfaction and retention and patients benefit from improved clinical outcomes and higher satisfaction with their care The CNO for England s national Excellence programme is underpinned by ensuring evidence based approaches in the development of positive practice environments The Midlands Regional Excellence Network MREN formed in brings together senior nurse leaders across integrated care systems to focus on harnessing a non hierarchical approach collective leadership and creating positive work environments for staff which aligns with the CNO for England s vision Six pillars of Excellence have emerged that reflect common themes from the MREN namely shared professional decision making local accreditation meaningful recognition distributed leadership continuous quality improvement and research and innovation Definitions are provided here Shared professional decision making a non hierarchical approach where staff are involved in making decisions about their practice It is also known as shared decision making shared governance or collective leadership Local accreditation a framework for a comprehensive assessment of care quality at a local level This framework includes standards of care and enables areas of improvement to be identified and areas of Excellence to be celebrated Meaningful recognition the recognition of nurses and or midwives for their contributions and value which promotes fulfilment and professional pride This may include awards honours celebrations and a culture of day to day recognition Distributed leadership building and sustaining leadership capacity at all levels through different roles in organisations Final version December Page of Continuous quality improvement a methodical approach to solve problems improve the quality of services and improve outcomes Research the scientific inquiry to generate new knowledge Innovation encompasses new novel methods and ideas A literature review was undertaken as part of this study it identified an abundance of studies from the USA with clear gaps in the current evidence base namely a paucity of research studies from England exploring what Excellence is its impacts and the non acute healthcare provider perspective This identified an opportunity to define Excellence in England beyond existing frameworks and to explore Excellence in both acute and non acute healthcare provider settings NHS England NHSE commissioned University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust UHCW via the MREN to deliver this study in December The study was co created with regional and national stakeholders through the MREN and NHSE strategic partners to ensure the research would be meaningful and relevant to end users as well as scientifically robust The six pillars of Excellence comprise the framework of Excellence approaches to be explored within this study and the scope was agreed with NHSE commissioners This report sets out the study design methods findings and recommendations and identifies further research opportunities BACKGROUND The CNO for England set out three key priorities which align with the NHS Long Term Plan building a workforce fit for the future renewing the reputation of our profession for the future and recognising the value of nurses and midwives As part of this strong leadership promoting quality and safety and the development of an engaged and empowered workforce are crucial in ensuring the delivery of this vision and the NHS Long Term Plan In alignment with this vision and workforce plan foundation programmes have been developed by NHSE with resources in development for shared professional decision making local accreditation and collective leadership together with the commissioning of programmes such as Pathway to Excellence Work has been undertaken across England developing and implementing these approaches To support the quality and safety agendas local accreditation provides nurses and midwives with a comprehensive framework to assess the quality of care at local levels In April a guide was launched to support the development of local accreditation programmes Final version December Page of To support the development of an engaged and empowered workforce the CNO for England also set out a vision for a national collective leadership model where nursing and midwifery collective voices are valued The first national CNO Shared Professional Decision Making Council was established in May and nurses and midwives shared innovative ways of working during the COVID pandemic through shared decision making councils and case study publications As part of the collective leadership programme NHSE also supported a national cohort of organisations to apply for Pathway to Excellence designation a framework for creating positive practice environments for staff to improve satisfaction and retention Building on this work the CNO Excellence programme aligns with the CNO s national vision to establish an England wide collective leadership model with a focus on transformational leadership research and innovation It supports the growth of the evidence base regarding Excellence and ensures the Excellence agenda is driven forwards for the benefit of our communities In the MREN a collaboration of organisations across the Midlands region was formed to support these aims act as a test bed for new approaches and share learning This study was commissioned to support the aims of the MREN and Excellence agenda within the wider national context AIMS To explore organisational approaches to adopting and embedding Excellence To identify and analyse case studies from existing Excellence work within acute provider settings in the Midlands understand transferability of elements from acute providers into non acute settings and demonstrate the impacts of Excellence approaches on outcomes OBJECTIVES The following objectives were agreed with NHSE Review the literature Describe current state of Excellence approaches in acute and non acute provider settings in the Midlands region Explore behaviours that drive Excellence Explore transferability of Excellence into non acute healthcare provider settings Explore the association and impact of Excellence approaches on metrics Provide recommendations regarding the transferability of Excellence pillars Final version December Page of Provide recommendations to build on the national Excellence work to help determine approaches to Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery Provide recommendations for further study STUDY DESIGN This study used a mixed methods design conducted through five key stages of data collection work packages namely literature review scoping method an online survey cross sectional case studies interviews and analysis of previously reported data A mixed methods approach was chosen to ensure the methods adequately addressed the breadth of study questions Study design included using the COM B behavioural change model throughout to explore the conditions for change and the behaviours associated with the drive for continuous improvement in Excellence adoption COM B together with values based co creation also guided question development see section and Data were organised and managed using the Framework Approach often used for large scale data collections providing continuity throughout each work package of the study Data analysis and synthesis were guided by COM B and conducted within an overall framework provided by the six pillars of Excellence as defined by the MREN An overview providing more detail of the five work packages supporting data collection for this study is listed here A review of the available literature through a scoping review method to inform the study gap study questions and design Survey online cross sectional that was sent to organisational leads for Excellence from acute and non acute care providers in the Midlands using inclusion criteria to establish the current Excellence state Case studies through a call for case studies and subsequent mini interviews with organisational leads for Excellence from acute providers to explore key factors contributing to Excellence in the Midlands region and establish illustrative examples for publication Interviews semi structured with organisational leads for Excellence from non acute providers to explore and understand transferability of Excellence approaches into non acute settings Extraction and analysis of previously reported data from regional and national databases Final version December Page of COM B model The COM B model developed by Michie et al was selected as the evidence based model to guide the study In healthcare this model provides a recognised foundation for identifying and designing interventions aimed at behaviour change It recognises that capability opportunity and motivation are dynamic interactive and environmental factors that can be influenced and contribute to shaping desired behavioural outcomes Figure Figure COM B model According to Michie et al capability is defined as psychological and physical capability including staff knowledge and skills Opportunity is defined as factors that make the behaviour possible and includes physical environmental opportunities as well as social opportunities according to cultural norms Motivation is defined as internal automatic and reflective processes that influence behaviours This includes analytical decision making emotional responses and habitual behaviour The COM B model was used throughout to guide the study design develop study questions and devise a framework to organise and manage data for deductive and inductive iterations of data analysis It was also used to integrate data during the process of data collection analysis and interpretation in line with mixed methodology Through this model the study team sought to understand how positive practice environments inclusive of capability opportunity and motivation could be developed leading to Excellence as the desired outcome Co creation with key stakeholders Key stakeholders were identified and involved throughout the study development to achieve value co creation and sense checking The value co creation approach focused on creating value with and for multiple stakeholders which involve both service providers and service users It was co created in its field of application Excellence with a focus on translation to practice so the research would be meaningful and relevant to end users as well as Final version December Page of scientifically robust Key stakeholders involved in co design through all study phases included the UHCW Operational Delivery Group NHSE strategic partners Excellence subject matter experts and regional and national stakeholders through the MREN Development of study questions The study team first developed their understanding of the topic through background reading the literature review and sharing their experience and expertise The study questions were then developed through engagement with key stakeholders from the UHCW Operational Delivery Group Participants and settings Participants are the designated leads for Excellence from organisations that meet the study inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Care Quality Commission CQC registered acute care provider organisations in the Midlands CQC registered non acute care providers in the Midlands to include hospices care homes GP practices community and mental health organisations This includes NHS and non NHS organisations that have at least one provider site in the Midlands region Exclusion criteria Any organisations that do not meet the above criteria There are distinct provider organisations in the CQC care directory as of th January with a Region of West Midlands or East Midlands which have a Service type including one or more of the following terms Hospital GP Community Hospice Care home Residential and Mental health From this pool organisational leads for Excellence whose organisations were part of the MREN and met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study Recruitment The process for contacting and recruiting organisational Excellence leads was agreed with NHSE commissioners during study set up Appendix A wide range of approaches were used to recruit participants described here Presentations given to the MREN with invitation from the Chair Final version December Page of Study information sent to all members of the MREN and organisational leads for Excellence Letter for engagement developed by the PI and shared on behalf of the MREN Chair and the NHS England Midlands Chief Nurse with members of the MREN Call for case studies and study invitation with information and key contact details sent by email to all organisational leads for Excellence within the MREN Ethical approval The study was approved by the Coventry University Research Ethics Committee Reference P Appendix a Approval by the Research Development Department at UHCW to organise and manage the study was obtained GF and GF Appendix b Study management A robust and systematic study protocol was developed and agreed with commissioners this protocol guided the study methods and analysis as described in section The Principal Investigator PI met weekly with the study team a combination of subject matter expertise and experience enabled the study to be delivered at pace Oversight and assurance were provided regularly to the Operational Delivery Group and NHSE commissioners METHODS Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analysed throughout the mixed methods study Appendix The literature review Scoping method Work package The literature review was conducted using scoping review methodology through the framework set out by Arksey and O Malley This uses a six stage process to examine the scope of research namely I Specify the research question II Identify the relevant literature III Select studies IV Chart the data V Summarise and synthesise data VI Use expert consultation Final version December Page of This process was supported by PRISMA Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses to organise the screening and manage the flow of literature Within the literature the team sought to understand the following key questions Literature review questions Is Excellence defined If yes what are the commonalities and differences across definitions What are the range of components of Excellence Are the outcomes reported If yes what are the outcomes A literature review and protocol Appendix were produced and refined with review and feedback from the UHCW Operational Delivery Group and NHSE commissioners The search strategy Appendix was developed using key words devised by the study team based on their knowledge and further refined with expertise from a specialist health librarian from the UHCW Clinical Evidence Based Information Service CEBIS team Searches were conducted in the following databases PubMed EMBASE and CINAHL according to those with appropriate focus and scope to reduce duplication in available information and expedite the review After inclusion exclusion criteria were established Appendix papers were screened for eligibility using RAYYAN which is a software application designed to facilitate ease of collaborative decision making across a study team in literature reviews The process of study selection was conducted using PRISMA The quality of each paper was appraised using the checklist from Hawker et al In accordance with the Arksey and O Malley framework for scoping studies papers were not excluded based on a quality assessment Instead all data relevant to answer the review questions were charted using a piloted data extraction form analysed interpreted and displayed using the stages of a scoping review study Survey Work package The COM B model guided development of questions which were populated into a cross sectional mixed methods survey to collect data across all organisations surveyed at one point in time The survey consisted of questions in eight sections Appendix Six Excellence approaches n were selected to frame the study after consultation with stakeholders from NHSE and the MREN and agreed with NHSE commissioners namely Final version December Page of Shared professional decision making Local accreditation Meaningful recognition Distributed leadership Continuous quality improvement Research and innovation The survey was reviewed by the study team and verified according to the Consensus based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies CROSS guidelines for survey development Prior to distribution the survey was piloted to confirm suitability of the questions Each participant was asked to self assess their organisation s use of the six pillars to establish their current position and understand baseline data The survey was distributed via Microsoft Forms to organisational leads for Excellence from acute and non acute provider organisations in the MREN who met the study inclusion criteria Single stage population cross sectional sampling was used The survey was performed during the first two and a half weeks of March A Participant Information Sheet Appendix a was developed and provided to participants with the email invitation and survey link Data was collected via the online survey using Microsoft Forms The first page of the online survey included an integrated consent statement Participants were informed that all data would remain confidential and survey results would be reported as aggregate data Individual names of organisations would not be published with their survey responses and names would be anonymised for reporting Once participants ticked the box provided to indicate their consent and proceeded beyond the consent page this was received as evidence of their consent Survey results were not received anonymously Each participant was given the option to provide their email address if they wished to nominate their organisation to participate in the case studies or interviews Participants who provided their email address were reviewed by the PI where the Excellence pillars used by the organisation were documented in the study database The PI selected organisations who used at least one pillar of Excellence to achieve a maximum variation of pillars across the range determined by the MREN n These decisions were recorded on the sampling strategy record Appendix Final version December Page of Case studies of acute organisations Work package Mini interviews lasting minutes were designed to contextualise and quantify the existing Excellence work within acute provider organisations A semi structured interview guide with questions was developed Appendix a guided by the COM B model providing a range of interview questions The mini interviews enabled further information augmenting the survey to establish illustrative practice examples developed into a compendium of case studies Participants were selected from organisational leads for Excellence from acute provider organisations who completed the survey and provided their contact email address They were sent an email invitation to participate in a one to one mini interview A Participant Information Sheet Appendix b was provided for participants in the email invitation The interviews took place via Microsoft Teams and participants were asked to choose a location to do the interview where they would not be disturbed On the day of the interview participants completed a digital consent form Appendix and were informed that confidentiality for the interview process was assured The participants were asked questions per the interview schedule to explore what Excellence looks like at their organisation Interviews were not recorded the researcher took notes during the interview directly into an Excel document Following the interview these notes were deductively summarised according to study questions fractured and transferred into the pre prepared theoretical framework where it was organised and managed in accordance with the Framework Approach Using Microsoft Excel data was displayed for analysis within and across cases per interview to establish connections and themes to be reported Analysis and synthesis were guided by the COM B model The information provided was used to write narrated case studies Participants were given the opportunity to review and confirm the accuracy of their case studies by email The case studies were compiled into an e book for online publication through NHSE Interviews with non acute organisations Work package The same processes as per acute provider case studies work package section were followed The essential differences are described below Interviews lasting up to one hour were designed to explore and contextualise the current state of non acute providers and understand transferability of Excellence initiatives into non acute Final version December Page of settings A semi structured interview guide using COM B with questions Appendix b was developed to augment information given by participants in the survey and to explore transferability of initiatives Participants were organisational leads for Excellence from non acute provider organisations who were purposefully selected from work package A Participant Information Sheet Appendix c was provided Participants were asked questions per the interview schedule to explore what Excellence looks like at their organisation and understand transferability of initiatives into non acute settings Anonymity was ensured for the interviews and data was not identifiable names and identifying features relayed during the interviews were removed and replaced with unique identifier codes and pseudonyms Metrics Work package This work package was designed to include extraction and analysis of previously reported publicly available non anonymised data for healthcare providers in the Midlands from five existing regional and national databases The aims were to measure the impact and association of the six selected Excellence approaches on outcomes to add to the evidence base and demonstrate the benefits to patients and staff of engaging in Excellence activities via the framework of Excellence pillars The outcomes agreed with NHSE commissioners were Staff retention and leaver rates NHS Staff Survey results Pathway to Excellence designation Magnet designation NHS Kitemark for Preceptorship NHS Kitemark for Pastoral Support for internationally educated nurses CQC results This work package was designed to explore if a correlation exists between the presence of Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery as defined in the literature review findings section and improved outcomes at organisations Data measures recorded by NHS and health care organisations have been reviewed against an Excellence Score and Maturity Matrix created as part of this research Final version December Page of To enable descriptive statistics and regression analysis scores reflecting Excellence activity at each organisation maturity of each organisation s Excellence journey and coding of non numerical data was required Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables It can be utilised to assess the strength of the relationship between variables and for modelling the future relationship between them The method in which this was done is described below Excellence Activity Scoring To enable descriptive statistics and regression analysis to be undertaken each site was scored against the following four Excellence measures as defined in the literature review findings section Attainment of Pathway to Excellence Magnet designation Attainment of NHS Kitemark for Preceptorship Attainment of NHS Kitemark for Pastoral Support for internationally educated nurses Use of a Quality Improvement approach at their organisation Each site was scored accordingly for each measure for Yes this does exist for No this does not exist Using this scoring system all organisations were assigned an Excellence Measure Score from The following scores were assigned Scores Number of organisations with the assigned Excellence score Final version December Page of Maturity Matrix score To enable descriptive statistics and regression analysis to be undertaken a maturity matrix score was assigned to each site This allowed further exploration of the maturity of Excellence activities self reported by each organisation The Lenses maturity matrix A tool developed and reviewed by the UK Government to assess the maturity of a programme and identify areas that need more development based on strategic areas of Vision Design Plan Transformational leadership Collaboration Accountability and People The tool enables each area to be assessed through five levels of maturity Using the Lenses maturity matrix all sites were assigned a maturity matrix score to gauge the position of organisational development based on survey responses on the six pillars of Excellence page and the duration of their existence in each organisation The following scores were assigned Scores Number of organisations with corresponding Maturity Matrix score Data parameters were chosen via the Research Steering Committee as being appropriate to review correlation and perform regression analysis The following inclusion exclusion criteria were applied to data parameters o Inclusion criteria for data parameters The most recently available full data sets from all organisations as defined in the study to avoid bias and ensure equity o Exclusion criteria Incomplete or and unavailable data sets Pre existing data parameters were previously reported publicly

review Twenty three studies were included in the review Figure Figure PRISMA flow diagram of study selection Study characteristics Of the studies were conducted in the USA one in Iran one in Denmark and one in the Philippines All studies explored Excellence in hospital settings There were quantitative studies two qualitative studies and two mixed methods studies One study explored qualitative data from the perspective of patients and three studies from the perspective of direct care nurses Most of the papers viewed Final version December Page of Excellence through the lens of a formal accreditation programme Magnet Recognition Programme n Pathway to Excellence n Beacon Award for Excellence n Summary of findings The summary of findings for each review question are described below Review question Is the concept of Excellence defined If yes how is it defined The concept of Excellence is directly defined in four studies the remaining studies referred to it indirectly Excellence is complex with wide and varied definitions and there are limited studies exploring this Excellence can be applied at individual ward or organisational levels The concept of Excellence is relational to exemplary evidence based professional practice and high quality patient care outcomes There are definitions from accrediting organisations as well as definitions from philosophy and theory Organisational excellence is recognised through benchmarking programmes such as ANCC Magnet Recognition Programme and AACN Beacon Award for Excellence with high quality empirical outcomes through Magnet and positive practice environments through the Pathway to Excellence programme Philosophers and theorists explore individual Excellence through values pattern recognition based on clinical experience and sensing a surplus of meaning in interactions with patients Review question Are the range of components defined If yes how is it defined The range of components of Excellence are defined in studies Components of Excellence include personal values based qualities interpersonal qualities towards patients relatives and colleagues and organisational professional components Excellence can be achieved through demonstrating values transformational leadership QI and evidence based practice Review question Are the outcomes of Excellence reported If yes what are the reported outcomes The outcomes of Excellence are reported in out of studies The primary exposure to Excellence is via the Magnet Recognition Programme n The reported outcomes include Outcomes related to patient quality safety and experience n mortality rates readmission rates length of stay nurse sensitive indicators patient experience Outcomes related to staff satisfaction and experience n Final version December Page of staff satisfaction engagement and collaboration Financial performance n and Electronic health record use n Most studies demonstrate a positive association between Excellence and improved outcomes particularly for patient length of stay mortality rates patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction and engagement Excellence achieves improved outcomes for staff and patients Conclusion The literature review identified a proliferation of literature from the USA with clear gaps in the current evidence base namely a dearth of evidence from England and the non acute healthcare provider perspective This provides opportunity to define Excellence beyond existing frameworks and to explore Excellence in acute and non acute healthcare provider settings The DEFiNe study addresses these gaps in the research it has been conducted in the Midlands region using robust research methodology and the COM B model It defines Excellence beyond existing frameworks and explores Excellence in both acute and non acute healthcare provider settings across the Midlands Survey Work package From the provider organisations in the Midlands region who met the inclusion criteria Excellence leads from organisations responded to the survey response rate From the organisations were acute and were non acute provider organisations All acute providers were NHS organisations From the non acute providers six were NHS organisations and four were non NHS organisations All survey respondents who nominated their organisation to participate were invited to join the relevant work package Twelve acute provider organisations participated in work package case studies and three non acute provider organisations participated in work package interviews Survey results informed findings in work packages and metrics Since the advent of digital surveys response rates have been increasing to our survey would therefore indicate a good response rate and uses a replicable process However the response rate would likely fluctuate over time related to participant motivation to complete the survey Larger and more diverse sampling of participating organisations would increase generalisability of findings

interviews All were from acute NHS organisations Summary of findings The six pillars of Excellence in acute organisations The following is a summary of findings from the six individual pillars of Excellence as reported by acute organisations Commonalities and differences across cases were identified integrated from survey responses and case study interviews Pillar Shared professional decision making SPDM The most recurring concept for this pillar was SPDM as a vehicle for staff empowerment promoting the voice of direct care staff in driving change n SPDM provides professional development and career progression opportunities n and improves staff engagement and well being n and patient experiences n From the four organisations who reported challenges releasing staff from clinical duties for SPDM one organisation protected staff time for SPDM through the electronic rostering system In the highest achieving exemplar organisations SPDM was perceived as multi disciplinary and inclusive n and accepted by the wider organisation as an approach to drive Equality Diversity and Inclusion EDI initiatives n Pillar Local accreditation Staff ownership of practice and care outcomes were the most common concepts within local accreditation n The accreditation framework was described as a useful tool for assurance n and a valuable method for motivating staff to improve outcomes n and reassuring patients and families of standards of care n The most successful organisations closely engaged clinical leaders such as Ward Managers and Matrons in the accreditation process n included multidisciplinary colleagues n and ensured data was accessible for local teams n Pillar Meaningful recognition Meaningful recognition was identified as an approach that generates individual and team motivation n promotes a culture of celebration n improves staff well being and pride n and improves care n It was the one pillar where participants discussed having fun or invoking deep emotions n such as crying from an emotive experience and remembering Final version December Page of why they chose to enter the profession Five organisations reported other professions initially felt excluded from nursing and midwifery specific awards so offerings were expanded to include other groups Two organisations used this approach to celebrate diversity and promoted diverse representation on award panels One organisation reported building staff capability to engage in meaningful recognition through a dedicated Facilitator to support with staff preparations for showcases and presentations Pillar Continuous quality improvement QI Continuous QI was embedded through formal Trust wide models in six organisations and driven through organisational strategy and culture that was open to improvement led by the CNO with Board level and senior nursing and midwifery leaders described herein as senior leaders n QI develops leaders as coaches n and fosters a culture that embraces improvement n leading to improved outcomes and experiences for patients and families n Two organisations had QI programmes in place but experienced challenges respondents attributed these challenges to leadership styles and organisational cultures that were not open to change Analysis on the two divergent cases is described on page Pillar Distributed leadership Distributed leadership was identified as a principle to promote leadership at all levels n build leadership capability n and empower direct care staff to make decisions and drive change n There was variation in how organisations achieved this organisations accomplished this through leadership training for all levels of staff n principles of shared governance n and providing opportunities for direct care nurses and midwives to communicate openly with leaders through forums n Pillar Research and innovation Through research and innovation staff feel valued and invested n evidence is translated to clinical practice and outcomes are improved n The highest achieving exemplar organisations developed capability in research and innovation through internal Fellowship programmes n incorporating leadership skills to complement external training programmes The most common barrier reported was the perception of research as daunting or irrelevant n One organisation discussed using a building block approach to build confidence and capability e g supporting staff to write reflections and perform audits then building on these experiences Final version December Page of Analysis Behaviours that drive Excellence as the outcome Findings have been analysed and synthesised through the COM B model which establishes that capability opportunity and motivation are dynamic factors that can be influenced to shape the desired behavioural outcome Through the Behaviour Change Wheel framework within this model interventions driving large scale behaviour change are generalisable to organisations and entire populations Through this theoretical lens positive practice environments promoting capability opportunity and motivation lead to Excellence as the desired outcome The dynamic factors driving Excellence as a behavioural outcome are illustrated in Figure Figure Dynamic factors driving Excellence as the behavioural outcome COM B model The behaviours that drive Excellence as the outcome are described below Capability Capability is built through comprehensive training for nurses and midwives at all levels Dedicated Facilitators Leads and or teams with subject matter expertise deliver training and coaching building knowledge skills and confidence in their capabilities to initiate change and deliver successful outcomes The highest achieving exemplar organisations align training across the Excellence framework and integrate principles of leadership continuous QI local accreditation and SPDM These comprehensive training packages equip teams with the knowledge skills and confidence to engage in Excellence and navigate complex systems Final version December Page of For organisations beginning their Excellence journey CNOs and senior leaders find it valuable to learn through visits and meetings from experienced organisations who have successfully implemented and embedded Excellence programmes They use this learning to design programmes and develop infrastructure that build capability Opportunity Nurses and midwives require not only training and support to achieve Excellence they also need accessible opportunities to become involved Support of time away from clinical duties provides opportunities to fully engage in Excellence related activities When the Excellence pillars are embedded within other programmes it increases staff exposure to these concepts whilst providing additional opportunities to become involved Leaders demonstrating coaching and facilitative transformational leadership styles also provide collective opportunities for nurses and midwives to contribute as these leadership styles place value on engaging and encouraging others A sense of inclusion was a recurring key concept When clinical leaders such as Ward Managers and Matrons feel involved and understand the relevance of the Excellence pillars they encourage their teams to participate and support their time released from clinical duties Involvement from multidisciplinary colleagues is key in obtaining wider team and organisational support and embedding these principles across the organisation Involvement of staff from diverse backgrounds and or with protected characteristics also promotes a sense of inclusion When staff feel they belong they engage with Excellence and use it as a vehicle to promote EDI initiatives Additionally positive action programmes and targeted interventions for staff from diverse backgrounds promote the sociability and accessibility of these opportunities Motivation In addition to building capability and providing accessible opportunities for involvement staff need to feel psychologically safe and have the desire to engage Psychological safety is a perception or shared belief that it is safe to take interpersonal risks within a team without fear of negative consequences such as blame In psychologically safe work environments people feel they can be open and speak up and they feel comfortable challenging the system Analysis of the highest achieving exemplar organisations revealed that their staff feel secure voicing ideas and changing practice In these organisations staff feel comfortable doing so because their organisational culture is open to improvement and their CNO and senior leaders role model positive attitudes towards continuous improvement Final version December Page of Whilst many organisations report successes into committees exemplar organisations within the case studies also meaningfully recognise and intentionally celebrate their staff and teams Celebrations invoke emotions such as pride and joy that influence automatic motivational processes and reinforce positive behaviour driving Excellence For celebrations to be received well staff must want to be celebrated this is influenced by organisational culture and role modelling from the CNO and senior leaders Excellence is intentionally driven by reflective motivational factors such as strategic priorities with clear goals and desired outcomes This highlights the importance of transformational leadership in setting out an inspiring vision for Excellence that nurses and midwives can aspire to achieve When Excellence benefits local services and teams managers and teams see the value of the work and support it Realising the benefit of their investment may help overcome reported challenges such as taking time out of clinical duties Furthermore when staff are compassionate and empathetic understand the patient experience and are trained to use data they are motivated to improve patient experiences and use data to drive and demonstrate improvements What does Excellence as the behavioural outcome look like The dynamic factors described above build capability opportunity and motivation and drive Excellence as the desired behavioural outcome From recurring concepts across survey and interview data Excellence as a behaviour is exemplified by empowered and engaged nurses and midwives at all levels from direct care staff to the CNO What does Excellence at all levels look like Participants reported that direct care nurses and midwives are motivated and engaged in Excellence activities They feel psychologically safe and empowered to use their voice make decisions and own their practice They demonstrate compassion and empathy to patients and use data and evidence to lead drive change and improve outcomes They are open to learning professionally developed satisfied with their work recruited and retained They feel included and valued are proud to be nurses and midwives and celebrate each other Clinical leaders such as Ward Managers and Matrons understand the Excellence framework see the value and relevance and support their teams time released from clinical duties They demonstrate coaching and facilitative leadership styles to develop their teams capabilities and Final version December Page of confidence They value the voice of direct care nurses and midwives and encourage staff to demonstrate leadership and make decisions They are proud and celebrate their teams Facilitators and leads for programmes related to the Excellence framework empower nurses and midwives by building capability linking them into opportunities and motivating them Facilitators and leads give them the knowledge skills and confidence to navigate complex systems lead and contribute Findings show that the CNO and senior leaders are engaged and understand the value of the Excellence framework They intentionally drive Excellence through strategy infrastructure and visible involvement They motivate and empower nurses and midwives across the organisation by role modelling the principles underpinning the Excellence framework such as collective leadership valuing improvement and celebrating They use their behaviour and influence to shape a culture that fosters Excellence and empowers nurses and midwives at all levels Additional outcomes from Excellence Participants reported that Excellence promotes positive workplace and organisational cultures that are open to improvement and values the contributions of nurses and midwives Participants also reported that Excellence improves experiences and outcomes for staff including well being and satisfaction experiences for patients and families and quality and safety outcomes for patients As the model is a dynamic cycle Excellence promotes these positive outcomes which in turn strengthen the sources of behaviour and make the behaviour more likely to occur This is illustrated below in Figure Figure A dynamic cycle Interventions drive Excellence as a behaviour leading to improved outcomes and reinforcing the cycle by strengthening the sources of behaviour Final version December Page of Divergent cases Two organisations reported divergent activity and perceptions Although both organisations had QI programmes in place these programmes experienced challenges and reported no tangible outputs or successes There was no reported structured Trust endorsed QI methodology and the Excellence leads reported that neither their organisational cultures nor their leaders were open to change or improvement As a result staff did not feel empowered to use their voice identify new ideas or engage with the programmes in place Vignette In case study interviews with organisational Excellence Leads from acute providers participants were asked to describe how QI is used in their organisation and describe barriers or challenges Two organisations reported experiencing challenges with their QI programmes We have a continuous QI programme in place but we really struggle We ve tried to give teams the tools to implement changes and own it but we have leadership and management that don t support continuous improvement and aren t open to it So people don t feel enabled to make changes themselves and wait for others to come in and do it Our leaders expect others to fix their own problems without engaging them We need to do better engaging and involving our nurses and midwives We have a poor leadership culture around this and it s a barrier to activity Organisational Excellence Lead The organisation has been stagnant and not trying to improve and the QI programme has struggled Although we have a QI team the organisation hasn t invested in a specific QI model or the resource so we don t have the capability internally for improvement work Leaders haven t engaged with any direct care staff about this Organisational Excellence Lead These two examples depict broad challenges within leadership and organisational culture in relation to the delivery of QI work Whilst the COM B model was used to analyse and synthesise cases Azjen s Theory of Planned Behaviour was applied to interpret the divergent cases This theory establishes that an individual s intention to engage in a behaviour determines whether they will engage in the behaviour Their intentions are influenced by personal attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioural control Personal attitudes include perceptions and assumptions Subjective norms include how the attitudes of others are perceived Perceived behavioural Final version December Page of control is the extent they believe they control their own behaviour shaped by internal and external factors In the two divergent cases although QI programmes were in place nurses and midwives did not feel empowered to engage or contribute Through the Theory of Planned Behaviour when nurses and midwives did not feel empowered to voice ideas perceived their leaders did not welcome change and perceived a low level of control they would not have the intention to engage with Excellence as a behaviour even if programmes were available These two cases highlight the crucial role of positive organisational culture and leadership to determine the success of Excellence programmes after implementation Key points from case studies of acute organisations The following is a summary of key points to create conditions for change where behaviours that drive Excellence can grow and be sustained as part of positive organisational culture Where organisations identified success they had the following Professional leadership that role modelled positive attitudes to change fostered meaningful recognition and invested in building capability and providing opportunities for continuous improvement An organisational culture that was open to learning and change focused on continuous improvement Psychologically safe work environments where staff felt comfortable speaking up and changing practice Engagement and buy in from nurses and midwives at all levels from direct care staff to the CNO and senior leaders Conclusion from case studies of acute organisations The six pillars of Excellence are reflected in the organisations taking part in the case study interviews They demonstrate how the six pillars drive capability opportunity and motivation to impact behaviours Key conditions for change are professional leadership and organisational culture that are open to change with a focus on continuous improvement Building capability opportunity and motivation results in behaviours for sustainable improvement in culture to embed and drive Excellence Final version December Page of Interviews with non acute organisations Work package The interviews included participants from three non acute provider organisations in the Midlands region all of which were hospices Summary of findings The individual pillars of Excellence The following is a summary of findings from the six individual pillars of Excellence as reported by non acute organisations Three responses were received all from hospices Pillar Shared professional decision making SPDM Leaders in the hospices see great value in implementing the principles of shared professional decision making Although two hospices did not have SPDM councils they adopt the principles and ethos of SPDM In one hospice the concept of SPDM was interpreted as a way of helping patients to make informed decisions Pillar Local accreditation None of the hospices had guidance in place to deliver local accreditation and two respondents were not aware of local accreditation Pillar Meaningful recognition One hospice used meaningful recognition and described this as a focus on building staff resilience through huddles reflective practice to recognise retain and support them Two hospices had indefinable approaches for meaningful recognition of their staff Staff felt their contribution to patient care is relatively insignificant for example the hospice staff feel left behind acute trusts due to the nature of the work e g they felt this was saving lives compared to end of life care Promoting recognition requires leadership to communicate and reinforce staff value Leaders stated that letting staff know they re as important as staff working in the acute settings and they are valued and allowing staff to tweak a system that works in the acute setting by identifying and transferring core concepts empowers them to help build the framework and initiatives needed themselves Hospice Final version December Page of Pillar Continuous quality improvement QI Overall each hospice lacked a robust model and framework for delivery of QI Despite this in one hospice continuous QI was achieved by promoting the safety culture e g conducting training on human factors incivility and Patient Safety Incident Response Framework PSIRF linked to nursing and midwifery Excellence It was also cited that newly registered nurses are reluctant to express their ideas regarding quality improvement Hospices are smaller charitable organisations which may lack a typical organisational structure resulting in disparate frameworks Consequently the efforts of the lead practice educator lead nurses and individual nurses in hospices to enhance the quality of care may not be documented or linked into professional forums frameworks leading to the absence of reportable mechanisms Pillar Distributed leadership The three hospice leads interviewed stated that they followed a hierarchical leadership approach The second hospice stated they followed a leading together approach for distributed leadership In this hospice open forums were held where leaders provided opportunities for staff to create leadership tools to generate attitudes for change This promoted feedback from staff regarding new approaches to the management of patient care The final hospice focused on building distributed leadership regardless of hierarchy to include targeted training for aspiring leaders to develop an understanding of leadership styles decision making and collaboration with other colleagues and services Training places were filled through manager nominations to promote shared leadership There was representation of leadership from clinical and non clinical teams to promote distributed leadership as a multi professional approach Pillar Research innovation One hospice stated We have been involved in research projects with local universities We have developed our own innovative programmes and tools that have been presented at national conferences At a second hospice some nurses have completed research training leading to growing enthusiasm from other staff Growing research capacity and capability poses a challenge for the development of research in non acute organisations Final version December Page of Analysis The Excellence Framework The overall analysis and synthesis from the Excellence pillars is illustrated using the COM B model Figure The responses from non acute organisations n were derived for behaviour change associated with relevant capability opportunity motivation and interpreted as they were perceived to influence behaviours The final element of this Figure shows the potential anticipated outcomes of behavioural changes Figure COM B model illustrating dynamic factors driving Excellence in non acute settings Capability Capability is built by involving staff in building the framework and taking their experience and recommendations into consideration All the hospices recognised the need for training across the six pillars of Excellence to foster interest and promote enthusiasm among staff Opportunity Collaborating with and learning from subject matter experts in other organisations is essential for providing staff with the exposure needed to understand the frameworks and systems employed by different organisations This exposure allows staff to adapt best practices in their own organisations leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness in their work Final version December Page of Motivation Staff are particularly motivated and inspired when they receive encouragement and support from their leaders who role model Excellence behaviours Leaders empowering staff to take self initiatives aimed at achieving Excellence in their work and driving improvements within the organisation are key elements When staff are provided with appropriate training and resources they recognise the need for change and improvement and are more likely to take proactive steps to bring about positive transformations Staff are motivated through various methods such as acknowledging and validating their contributions Additionally incorporating patient experience and feedback into the workplace can also serve as an effective motivational tool The factors described above serve to cultivate capability opportunity and motivation propelling Excellence as the behavioural outcome Findings Findings described here present a summary from key questions asked at interviews with non acute organisations regarding current Excellence measures transferability and timeframes Leaders stated that they are aligned and actively involved in all measures of Excellence and they have a clear understanding of Excellence Leaders also demonstrated the benefits of Excellence to staff the organisation and patients communicating the importance of providing staff with appropriate resources to deliver high standards of care for patients They stated that Visibility of leaders is created by going into clinical areas spending time with different services Leaders adhere to this ethos take ownership and responsibility for their actions to encourage other staff They gave examples of developing staff through training on continuous quality improvement which promotes a safety culture through training on human factors incivility and PSIRF to improve the patient and family experience Using the principles of shared professional decision making SPDM enables staff participation and decision making with an aim to create a culture of open engagement with all staff regardless of their role or level ensuring equal access to contributions for everyone To successfully implement measures for Excellence it is essential to involve direct care staff giving dedicated time and space to learn and contribute to the development of these measures It is important to provide them with opportunities to share their opinions and understand how these measures are relevant to their roles Additionally leadership and coaching training can allow them to support others Feedback sessions focus groups with staff and engagement with change makers can be organised to bring about positive changes in local workplaces Final version December Page of while utilising change management theory Motivating staff through patient feedback and improved outcomes is also essential Additional Outcomes from Excellence behaviours If these behavioural changes were achieved the overall Excellence outcome would include advancements in patient services and improved patient outcomes There will be promotion of the Nursing and Midwifery professions because of motivated and engaged staff leading to a reduction in staff turnover and sickness Positive organisational culture will be promoted fostering a culture of Excellence that supports growth and success Key points from interviews with non acute organisations The findings from non acute participating organisations n are limited in their wider application due to lack of respondents Non acute organisations face challenges measuring the impact of Excellence approaches like SPDM meaningful recognition research and innovation and continuous quality improvement due to the lack of a framework and dedicated personnel Engaging expertise and the opportunity to learn from acute settings would assist this process Nurse and midwife leaders must explore leadership support regarding the development of Excellence measures and associated staff training required Delivery of a nursing and midwifery plan for Excellence through the MREN will enable staff to participate in the process Creating a staff network would enable staff to engage in decision making and develop leadership skills especially using the SPDM approach Developing a framework for each of the Excellence pillars and recruiting dedicated resources to establish these in non acute settings would help measure the impact of Excellence approaches and plan necessary improvements Conclusion from interviews with non acute organisations To implement the six pillars of Excellence successfully leaders in non acute organisations need greater knowledge and awareness of these to drive successful implementation They recognise the importance of these pillars to elicit positive changes and improve patient outcomes They are however keen to empower their staff to use the pillars effectively by learning from examples within acute organisations Despite this they have the awareness that they do not have a typical organisational structure processes and framework seen in larger acute organisations to implement the Excellence pillars Final version December Page of Metrics Work package Twenty participating organisations that met the criteria as detailed in section Methods were subject to analyses comprising of acute and non acute organisations The summary of findings is described below the full findings for this work package can be found in Appendix Summary of findings Metrics From creating Excellence and maturity matrix scores for participating sites it was possible to explore sites by score and the corresponding NHS outcome measures in the form of regression analysis to test hypotheses page The following key findings have been identified Although not statistically significant a correlation was found between nursing and midwifery Excellence and specific NHS nursing and midwifery workforce specific parameters When the Excellence measure is applied to organisational outcomes rather than nursing or midwifery specific outcomes a correlation cannot be seen A trend can be seen that shows the following Organisations that have higher Excellence scores achieved through Excellence designation marks and QI approaches and higher maturity scores demonstrate improved retention of nurses and midwives evidenced through lower leaver rates and higher workforce stability Conclusion Metrics Excellence approaches targeting nurses and midwives improves the stability index and decreases leaver rates demonstrating that Excellence where adopted has a positive impact on workforce retention of nurses and midwives Final version December Page of DISCUSSION The following is a discussion of all the work packages across the study exploring key findings and influencing factors This is the first study to identify and analyse case studies of Nursing and Midwifery Excellence within acute provider settings across the Midlands region scope transferability to non acute settings and explore impacts of Excellence on outcomes These findings provide valuable insights into what Excellence looks like in acute settings how these principles can be transferred into non acute settings and how Excellence might be measured to understand impact and outcomes for patients staff and organisations Findings of work package the literature review showed that Excellence can be applied at individual ward department or organisational levels This demonstrates the importance of Excellence frameworks that consider and promote Excellence within each of those levels Findings of work package case study interviews with acute organisations highlight the importance of psychological safety at work for nurses and midwives When staff feel comfortable speaking up without fear of blame or reprisal they can challenge existing practice and drive improvement Psychological safety improves learning communication team performance and patient safety outcomes As demonstrated in the case study interview findings professional leadership and organisational cultures that are open to change and continuous improvement are key influencing factors these two factors shape psychologically safe work environments and establish conditions for change within acute settings Transformational leaders are crucial in role modelling desired behaviours establishing strategic priorities with clear goals and outcomes and setting the tone of workplace culture Leaders can also strategically design programmes and develop infrastructure that builds capability opportunity and motivation promoting behaviours for sustainable improvement in culture which influence local workplaces and direct care nurses and midwives Excellence in acute settings is exemplified by nurses and midwives that are engaged and empowered at all levels When nurses and midwives are engaged with their work and feel professionally empowered this ultimately benefits patients and the wider workforce studies report improved patient quality and safety outcomes as well as improved staff satisfaction Direct care nurses and midwives may find it valuable to be engaged in the shaping of the Excellence framework although not explored due to the scope of this study direct care nurses Final version December Page of and midwives could be involved in a future study exploring their experiences through the lens of the Excellence framework Findings of work package interviews with non acute providers reveal that although the six pillars of Excellence are not always intentionally integrated some of the guiding principles are present within some organisations Non acute organisations demonstrated an openness to learn about transferable principles and a willingness to embrace and adopt Excellence approaches which are important aspects of cultural readiness for change As demonstrated in the findings of work package metrics approaches targeting a specific workforce in this case nurses and midwives improves workforce outcomes e g stability index of nurses and midwives reflecting workforce retention As acute and non acute organisations were included in the analysis this suggests that regardless of setting Excellence approaches targeting a specific workforce have beneficial impacts on workforce outcomes Although not explored further due to the scope of this study this is a finding of interest that warrants further research It is worth noting that the results for work package metrics only demonstrated a change in metrics within the nursing and midwifery profession and not the wider multidisciplinary team outside of these professions the organisation wide impact is yet to be seen This would require future targeted research to understand how maturity of approaches influences its impact and spread outside of the nursing and midwifery profession and across the wider system The strengths and limitations of the study are described below Strengths of the study include the mixed methods study design which captured both quantitative and qualitative data to comprehensively address study questions and add richness to the data Furthermore study design question development and data synthesis were underpinned by an evidence based theory driven approach using a theoretical framework to identify interventions aimed at behaviour change allowing the findings to be transferable across settings and populations The study followed a robust and systematic research protocol which was developed through a co creation approach with key stakeholders including the Regional Nursing Midwifery Excellence Network NHSE funders and the UHCW Operational Delivery Group Through co creation end users in the field collaborated with research and Excellence subject matter experts to ensure the study would be meaningful and relevant to end users as well as scientifically robust Final version December Page of There are limitations to the study The interviews in work package case studies with acute organisations and interviews with non acute organisations were intentionally planned through co design to be conducted online for participants convenience However it is acknowledged that the lack of face to face interaction may have influenced the quality of responses from participants For work package metrics the study team initially sought to capture five years worth of data However due to incomplete data parameters regarding NHS Staff Survey results for elements We are recognised and rewarded We each have a voice that counts We are a team Staff engagement Morale and workforce data availability the decision was made to limit analysis to data based on This decision ensured consistency in measurements avoided bias to organisations with full data parameters and promoted equity in the analysis process Additionally in work package metrics the study team initially sought to collect and analyse retention rates for nurses and midwives However due to incomplete data parameters on how retention rates for nurses and midwives were reported the decision was made to use Stability Index measurements instead as this was reported in a standardised manner for nurses and midwives This decision ensured consistency in analysis and avoided bias to sites with full data parameters As the study sample was taken from the Midlands region the extent to which findings can be generalised nationally is unknown and requires further research Overall the study highlights the pivotal role in both acute and non acute settings of professional leadership and culture in fostering openness to change with a focus on continuous improvement These create conditions for change where behaviours that drive Excellence can be encouraged and sustained Final version December Page of CONCLUSION In conclusion as the first study to explore Nursing and Midwifery Excellence in the Midlands region the DEFiNe study Determining Excellence Factors in Nursing and Midwifery is a valuable contribution which adds to the national evidence base in England It addresses gaps in research and informs regional and national work Study aims and objectives as set out in sections and were achieved The literature review work package demonstrated gaps in the research A paucity of evidence from England defining Excellence beyond existing frameworks including non acute healthcare settings This study addresses these gaps it has been conducted in the Midlands region using robust research methodology and the COM B model It defines Excellence beyond existing frameworks and explores Excellence in both acute and non acute healthcare provider settings across the Midlands The survey work package case studies with acute providers work package and interviews with non acute providers work package enabled Understanding the current state of Excellence in both acute and non acute settings across the Midlands The identification and analysis of case studies from acute organisations The exploration of behaviours that drive Excellence Understanding the transferability of elements from acute to non acute settings leading to recommendations for transferability Metrics work package enabled the exploration of association and impact of Excellence approaches on outcomes All the work packages of this study shaped the recommendations to build on the national Excellence work to help determine approaches to Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery and informed the recommendations for future research The study has clearly identified key factors and behaviours that drive Excellence shown the benefits of implementing the pillars of Excellence and demonstrated that the Excellence framework benefits the nursing and midwifery workforce Further research is required to address gaps identified by this study Final version December Page of RECOMMENDATIONS The following are recommendations to build on the national Excellence work to help determine what Excellence looks like and to transfer initiatives into non acute settings These recommendations are informed by study findings including case study interviews with acute providers interviews with non acute providers and metrics There is scope for organisational regional and national strategic leaders to shape work based on these recommendations Disseminate findings and share learning with key stakeholders including the MREN and relevant national networks This will ensure the study findings inform future work Prepare leaders to develop implement and sustain Excellence as part of organisational culture Strategic leaders are key to the success of the regional and national Excellence work they can use their influence to role model positive attitudes towards continuous improvement prioritise the development of positive practice environments and set out strategic priorities aligned to national Excellence ambitions Co develop with non acute organisations through the MREN an Excellence framework and delivery plan for non acute settings Identify dedicated leads from these settings to champion the work This will enable co design and opportunities for learning and support Continue to drive forward the Excellence agenda using an evidence based approach informed by research robust methodology and co creation This approach adds to the national evidence base and engages key stakeholders Consider alignment of the six pillars of Excellence to the national strategy As the first study to explore Excellence within the Midlands there is much more that needs to be understood Further research is warranted exploring the gaps identified by this study o Including a wider geographical range e g England wide o Scoping transferability into other health and social care settings o Understanding the experiences of direct care nurses and midwives through the lens of the Excellence framework o Exploring the experiences of patients and families through care quality and improved outcomes o Exploring shared professional decision making as an approach to drive EDI o Conducting face to face interviews to allow richer data collection o Identifying nursing and midwifery specific parameters to understand the direct impacts of Excellence o Identifying the impact of Excellence on workforce including recruitment retention and succession planning o Identifying the impact of Excellence on productivity and efficiency Final version December Page of REFERENCES NHS England Chief Nursing

female patients come you read the signals and you read it in other people into the room and they re very on the defence And So if I saw you getting frustrated I probably would then when you start

inefficiencies were also highlighted such reaching a ceiling as appointments given in error or services becoming unavailable at short notice leading patients to enter the healthcare setting We were able to escalate it to our managers who prepared for confrontation This perceived strain on the NHS was then escalated it to the ward manager Unfortunately identified by some staff as contributing to a decline in patient the ward manager did everything they could but tolerance there s only so much a ward manager can do They then escalated it to the consultant Unfortunately the Certainly in terms

structures both within and beyond their professional roles and often providing frontline staff with adequate tools to prevent violence high positioned themselves as actors for change in the context of these lighting the cascading effects of decisions made by those at the top of hierarchies For some conversations about preventing violence were the hierarchical divide overshadowed by an us versus

decision makers with each having tration of these staff towards senior managers and decision makers the power to limit or bolster the other s efforts to prevent violence within the hospital was marked by a perception that decisions or lack One physiotherapist and team service leader P reflected on the thereof seemed to undermine those on the ground in their attempts impacts of staff underreporting

levels of the organisational hierarchy seemed to shape staff responses and perceptions of violence as something that can P Security be mitigated When speaking from the bottom up perspective participants often I think some of the problem is that people don t report indicated a sense of reluctant acceptance as though resigned to the because they don t see anything happen at the end of inevitability of violence P Security concluded Our job is literally that So it s almost like well what s the point in re to get attacked that s how it seems at the moment In other instances porting it

what s the point that is not archetypal with certain types of aggression often from Whereas actually I know the trust is looking at how patients lacking capacity perceived as benign or inconsequential In they can improve that For me I m always saying the another example after initially giving little weight to their experiences more we report something they re going to have to do involving elderly patients with dementia who give you a rap on the something about it because if we don t report it it s not knuckles P Physiotherapist Team Service Leader later qualified a problem If all of a sudden

throughout the acquired over time interviews it was clear that many staff viewed it as less significant than physical assault Expressing a sentiment echoed by others one As a young female as soon as I

Page Introduction In January a multi professional Critically Appraised Topic CAT group was established to support a rapid review of literature related to Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment ReSPECT A CAT group is a community of practice with a common interest to assess what is known not known on a given topic in clinical practice by assessing the evidence A rapid review uses all the traditional tools and process expected for any high quality systematic review Appendix It is made rapid by limiting the breadth of databases searched using a very focused literature review question with clearly defined parameters Rapidity in this case was also achieved through the group approach contributing to each stage of the review process In our case this review was completed in months with contributions of members of clinical staff A CAT group is a pragmatic process which aims to establish key evidence to inform practice rather than publish new evidence Dissemination of further information will be achieved through production of an abstract poster and this report Review question To search the literature a question was framed using the PICO framework Population Intervention Comparison and Outcomes as below What are the educational needs of healthcare professionals regarding the optimal communication and understanding of RESPECT needs with patients and other healthcare colleagues Summary of findings Of the evidence reviewed n papers the following key points from papers selected n are noted as applicable to practice Supporting education regarding communication for doctors in training improves their skills which supports conversations negotiations surrounding Do Not Resuscitate orders and other related issues Education of nurses regarding active resuscitation decisions in a resuscitation team aids confidence and knowledge leading to improved decision making Improved documentation of discussions improves team communication and with patients about their care and the rationale for decisions made Understanding patient concerns using active listening skills with adequate consideration of the type of environment where the discussions take place and sharing of any concerns not limited to clinical issues are integral to the informed patient and relative decision making about resuscitation and other related issues The format adopted for written communication is shown to improve shared decision making related to resuscitation in a team and assists early escalation of and resolution of issues throughout an admission to hospital An acknowledgement that older age and multiple conditions of patients influences clinician decision making related to the inclusion of patients for Resuscitation not necessarily adversely but these factors are present in decision making This ends the summary of key points from the rapid evidence review Literature limitations Papers were global from Taiwan x USA x Australia x Iran x Wales x Nine papers were single centre studies All were cross sectional studies which makes it impossible to extrapolate exact data for individual staff groups aggregate only Bias potential was also possible through preference in sampling in highest scoring studies but partly mitigated through two reviewers blinded for all papers and adjudication for three papers using third reviewer Key words of the

national survey Rationale Compared with their Full Code counterparts patients with do not resuscitate do not intubate DNR DNI status receive fewer interventions and have higher mortality than predicted by clinical characteristics Objectives To assess whether internal medicine residents the front line providers for many hospitalized patients would manage hypothetical patients differently based on code status We hypothesized respondents would be less likely to provide a variety of interventions to DNR DNI patients than to Full Code patients Methods Cross sectional randomized survey of U S internal medicine residents We created two versions of an internet survey each containing four clinical vignettes followed by questions regarding possible interventions the versions were identical except for varying code status of the vignettes Residency programs were randomly allocated between the two versions Results Five hundred thirty three residents responded to the survey As determined by Chi squared and Fisher s exact test decisions to intubate or perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation were largely dictated by patient code status if Full Code if DNR DNI P for all scenarios Resident proclivity to deliver noninvasive interventions e g blood cultures medications imaging was uniformly high and unaffected by code status However decisions to pursue other aggressive or invasive options e g dialysis bronchoscopy surgical consultation transfer to intensive care unit differed significantly based on code status in most vignettes Conclusions Residents appear to assume that patients who would refuse cardiopulmonary resuscitation would prefer not to receive other interventions Without explicit clarification of the patient s goals of care potentially beneficial care may be withheld against the patient s wishes Keywords DNR DNI clinician decision making effect of code status Goodarzi et al SCORE Knowledge Attitude and Decision Making of Nurses in the resuscitation room regarding DNR decisions BACKGROUND Making appropriate decisions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR is very challenging for healthcare providers This study aimed to evaluate knowledge attitude and decision making about do not resuscitate DNR and termination of resuscitation ToR among nurses in the resuscitation team METHODS This descriptive cross sectional study was conducted in April September Participants were nurses from the CPR teams of two hospitals in Kermanshah and Hamedan Iran A valid and reliable researcher made instrument was used for data collection Data were analyzed using the Chi square Fisher s exact and Mann Whitney U tests the Spearman s correlation analysis and the logistic and rank regression analyses RESULTS Only and of participants had adequate knowledge about ToR and DNR The significant predictor of DNR and ToR knowledge was educational level and the significant predictors of decision making for CPR were educational level gender and history of receiving CPR related education P When facing a cardiac arrest and indication of DNR or ToR of participants reported that they would not start CPR of them reported that they would terminate CPR and of them reported that they would perform slow code The DNR decision had significant relationship with educational level DNR knowledge and ToR knowledge P while the ToR decision had significant relationship with educational level and ToR knowledge P CONCLUSION Nurses limited DNR and ToR knowledge and physicians conflicting orders and documentation can cause ethical challenges for nurses Clear guidelines for DNR orders or TOR is necessary for nurses in order to prevent any potential confusion legal or psychosocial issues and concerns surrounding CPR and improve their involvement in CPR decision making process KEYWORDS Cardiopulmonary resuscitation DNR order Ethics Resuscitation Orders Johnson et al SCORE Goals of patient care system change with video based education increases rates of advance cardiopulmonary resuscitation decision making and discussions in hospitalised rehabilitation patients Background Advance cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR discussions and decision making are not routine clinical practice in the hospital setting Frail older patients may be at risk of non beneficial CPR Aim To assess the utility and safety of two interventions to increase CPR decision making documentation and communication for hospitalised older patients Methods A pre post study tested two interventions i standard ward based education forums with CPR content and ii a combined two pronged strategy with Goals of Patient Care GoPC system change and a structured video based workshop against usual practice i e no formal training Participants were a random sample of patients in a hospital rehabilitation unit The outcomes were the proportion of patients documented as i not for resuscitation NFR and ii eligible for rapid response team RRT calls and rates of documented discussions with the patient family and carer Results When compared with usual practice patients were more likely to be documented as NFR following the two pronged intervention adjusted odds ratio aOR confidence interval CI Documentation of discussions with patients was also more likely aOR CI Characteristics of patients documented NFR were similar between the phases but were more likely for RRT calls following Phase P Conclusion An increase in advance CPR decisions occurred following GoPC system change with education This appears safe as NFR patients had the same level of frailty between phases but were more likely to be eligible for RRT review Increased documentation of discussions suggests routine use of the GoPC form may improve communication with patients about their care Cheng et al SCORE The training in SHARE communication course by physicians increases the signing of do not resuscitate orders for critical patients in the emergency room cross sectional study Background Communication skills may be an important skill for the front line emergency physicians Aim This study aimed to investigate the effect of training in a SHARE communication course by emergency physicians on patient notification and signing of do not resuscitate DNR orders for critical patients in the emergency room Design From a total of attending physicians in the emergency department physicians had been trained in the SHARE communication course An observation form designed based on the SHARE training was completed by two observers who noted the communication process between physicians and patients and family members during patient notification and signing a DNR order To assess the influence of physicians trained in a SHARE communication course on the signing of DNR orders a propensity score matched population was created to reduce the potential selection bias of patients and family members Setting Level trauma medical center in southern Taiwan Results There were individuals enrolled in the study of which signed the DNR order and did not sign it Analysis from matched pairs from this population revealed that significantly more family members would sign a DNR order if the physician had been trained in the SHARE communication course than when they did not receive this training vs respectively p The overall score of the observation form for physicians was higher in those individuals who had signed a DNR order than in those who did not sign it vs respectively p especially when the physician had chosen a quiet environment vs respectively p understood the patient s wishes and confirmed them vs respectively p and expressed concern vs respectively p In addition a feedback survey about the feelings experienced by these physicians during the process of patient notification did not reveal a significant difference during the communication with those who had or had not signed DNR orders Conclusion The training in a SHARE communication course can improve the communication skills of emergency physicians in patient notification and signing of DNR orders for critical patients Haire et al SCORE Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation documentation a quality improvement project Objectives This quality improvement project to enhance do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation DNACPR documentation in a Welsh National Health Service trust Methods A full clinical review cycle evaluating DNACPR forms per data collection total forms The DNACPR audit template was used to ensure standardised audit criteria After first data collection several changes were introduced a new version national form was adopted a series of education events to improve understanding of the DNACPR policy Electronic learning resources such as the TalkCPR videos and electronic staff record modules Results The evaluation of data demonstrated consistency in completion of forms The introduction of the new national audit form in phase resulted in clearer documentation of discussions held with patients their significant others and documented reasons why when conversations had not taken place Conclusion Documentation of DNACPR discussions in the trust demonstrably improved in several domains A central electronic record for advance and future care plans accessible by all relevant healthcare providers patients and carers may be an effective way of

of a first draft Report by March EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The Professional Nurse Advocate PNA programme is a clinical and professional leadership programme delivered by Higher Education Institutions HEI which equips nurses with the skills to deliver restorative clinical supervision to colleagues in England The programme has been gradually rolled out across England during with the aim of ensuring there will be PNAs in place to support colleagues in the following specialties Critical care Mental Health Adult Acute Children and Young Peoples inpatient settings Community Learning Disabilities Adult Children and Young People Safeguarding Health Criminal Justice settings HCJ and International Nurses In February NHSE sought an evaluation of the PNA programme A research team from Coventry University was commissioned to undertake this work This Executive Summary Report sets out the methods activities findings and recommendations as requested by commissioners BACKGROUND Launched towards the end of the third wave of the Covid pandemic the PNA programme was introduced at the start of a critical point for recovery in the NHS Whilst the pandemic had added complexity to care delivery and stretched the capacity of the nursing workforce the PNA programme provided an opportunity to re build resilience within the profession and promote workforce retention The A EQUIP Advocating for Education and Quality and Improvement Model with restorative clinical supervision career conversations is integral to PNA training and starts as soon as their time on the programme begins The HEI education programme equips PNAs to listen and to understand challenges and demands of fellow colleagues lead support and deliver quality improvement initiatives in response Course content focuses first and foremost on restorative supervision practices Beyond this the focus is on the four functions of the A EQUIP Model These four functions are as follows Clinical Supervision Restorative Monitoring Evaluation and Quality Control Normative Personal Action for Quality Improvement and Education and Development Formative EVALUATION AIM AND OBJECTIVES The evaluation aim was to explore the impact of the Professional Nurse Advocates PNA programme on PNAs and wider team with recommendations for improvements The following objectives were agreed by commissioners Create a logic model programme theory of change to explain programme implementation activities Rapid review of the PNA literature as this relates to empowerment Evaluate baseline data across organisations participating in the PNA programme Assess factors impacting on the delivery of the PNA programme Describe individual perceptions of PNAs and influencing contextual factors Describe individual perceptions of nurses receiving restorative supervision Assess the usefulness of the model and establish assumptions essential to delivery Evaluate the perceived benefits of restorative supervision plus enablers and barriers Provide recommendations on how the programme can be effectively embedded implemented and sustained across a range of contexts EVALUATION DESIGN A mixed methods design was implemented with four work packages The evaluation was theory driven throughout and we applied the concept of empowerment via Laschinger et al model and a theory of programme change Logic Model Laschinger s Model enabled the development of study questions survey design and structured the qualitative phase of the study including analysis enabling exploration of structural and psychological empowerment in the workplace and the indicators of positive work feelings Fig The Logic Model was used to map the inputs activities and outputs of the national programme with our clearly stated assumptions to guide our questions Figure Laschinger s Empowerment Model Structural Psychological Positive Work Empowerment Empowerment Feelings Job Opportunity Meaning satisfaction Information Confidence Commitment Support Autonomy Trust Resources Impact Low burnout Formal power Informal power DATA COLLECTION METHODS Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a survey case studies semi structured interviews and a final workshop with commissioners A Rapid Review of the available literature was used to inform our understanding of the topic and contributed to formation of questions alongside the Laschinger s empowerment model A survey was designed to explore the impact on perceptions and levels of empowerment with all PNAs and nurses who have delivered or received restorative clinical supervision Case study organisations in different settings provided the opportunity to undertake a deep dive of pertinent information at individual sites areas Semi structured interviews single and joint were completed with the following staff groups Higher Education Institute leads for the PNA course HEI regional lead PNAs site lead PNAs nurses in PNA roles PNAs and nurses who have received restorative clinical supervision RCS Nurses We adopted a sampling approach to achieve maximum variation so that we were able to access a wide range of views and perspectives We included staff working in District General Hospitals Community trusts large Acute Trusts and Mental Health Trusts and many speciality areas FINDINGS Survey An electronic survey was distributed by NHS England between August and December via email to three constituent groups Nurses who received RCS known as RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust PNA Leads There were responses to the survey RCS Nurses n PNAs n Trust Leads n Most respondents worked in adult nursing were female and mainly identified as white RCS Nurse respondents were more ethnically diverse than PNAs and Trust Leads Trust Leads and PNAs tended to be qualified for longer and were more likely to have been educated in the UK than RCS Nurses Of the PNA respondents had delivered RCS and had yet to do so Overall RCS was rated very positively in terms of enhancing structural empowerment psychological empowerment and positive work feelings These items were all rated at a median of moderately agree by all three groups illustrating strong beliefs in the effectiveness of RCS in having a positive impact on these aspects All groups provided a median rating of strongly agree to the statement I believe that restorative supervision is effective illustrating strong support for the effectiveness of RCS The ability of RCS to improve the support available to nurses at work and nurse confidence was rated as a median of strongly agree by all three groups Open text comments highlighted the importance of adequate time provision to undertake the role and to secure staff release for RCS A safe private space in a calm area to create a relaxed environment for the planned RCS session was overwhelmingly identified as a pre requisite factor in which to discuss confidential matters Most RCS Nurses were fundamentally satisfied with their experience of RCS which left them feeling positive and looking forward to continuing the process One example of this relates to being challenged matters related to work are opened up that could either hinder or push me to improve but they do push me to improve the way I approach work It seemed there was a growing appreciation of the benefits of RCS RCS was described as a reflective process that legitimises the time and the necessity for nurses to understand and process difficult experiences in their roles This could only be done with the support and underpinning of a trusting relationship Participating in RCS was described as a positive and constructive experience by many RCS nurses which had boosted their self confidence leaving them restored and reinvigorated Case Studies were conducted with eight sites spanning Healthcare and HEI settings across England to provide in depth contextually based information regarding the implementation of the professional nurse advocate programme For most HEIs the PNA training module was established at great speed in the context of the covid pandemic aided through experienced teaching staff amidst a great sense of urgency The case studies revealed that a personal commitment to implement the PNA programme was important but in the early waves a lack of communication hampered initial strategic efforts For example nurses undertaking the course in the early days often self selected and returned to organisations without a strategic lead in place to then implement the programme In later waves this became less common Learning was facilitated online using Microsoft team or zoom via a level Masters module requiring attendance one day per week over approximately weeks However it was noted that there was little parity regarding module content or assessment strategy across the many HEIs delivering the programme in the initial stages This created some frustrations and barriers to access for training amongst some PNAs due to inadequate entry credentials at the appropriate level to enable this study at level This was rectified in later course iterations A general appreciation was reflected that the PNA programme has opened opportunities for nurses at any stage of their career to engage in further study and to combine this with experience which served to make nurses feel valued and empowered in their roles For the most part QI activities focused on delivering the restorative aspect of the PNA role We asked participants about their understanding of RCS delivery outputs regarding the frequency and types of sessions offered Some participants described the workforce returns and counting activities but at the same time not being sure what counted as RCS Respondents in the case studies identified key aspects which enabled more effective joint working to achieve programme role out For example they operated a planned and strategic roll out with careful selection of nurses to complete the PNA training existing forums were used to drive the progress of the PNA work the PNA role was linked with others in similar domains e g practice educators speak up guardians psychological first aiders PNAs were given adequate time to functionalise this aspect of their role a wider interpretation of the PNA role was adopted and linked with existing clinical supervision mechanisms PNAs were enabled through CPD and this was facilitated through Personal Development Plans PNAs were supported to do their role through wellbeing mechanisms PNA leads were linked effectively to support via the NHS England PNA office All these elements enabled PNS leads to celebrate achievements and generated a sense of sustainability that this is not a project it is here to stay Interview data were collected from individuals with individual interviews and two person interviews This included Regional PNA leads Trust PNA leads PNAs and RCS Nurses and HEI Leads Individuals were recruited from a range of specialties such as the criminal justice system primary care and the ambulance service from a range of ages years males N and females N and those who completed PNA training via different course providers ranging from the first cohort to complete the course to the most recent cohort in total N different course providers It was evident that when the PNA programme was implemented clinical supervision was seen as a new thing for nursing the idea of nurse to nurse support was valued but had not really been experienced before for many respondents Clear differences were identified between clinical supervision and restorative supervision Nurses who had experienced RCS wanted the process to be normalized and more mainstream as there were still some concerns about the negative connotations associated with supervision Follow up after initial RCS was seen as important but there were barriers to this occurring Time and being freed from the duty were the chief issues Nurses who had completed the PNA course praised the content and experience of the studying for this qualification Online learning was the core approach due to covid restrictions and whilst many benefits were identified e g no travel some respondents felt more practical experience and assessment of their skills was needed However there were challenges in implementing what had been promoted during the programme within the workplace context This was largely related to short staffing and a lack of space and time to undertake RCS Most PNA respondents were very clear on the benefits of RCS in restoring supporting and enabling nurses and in some cases enabling nurses to stay in the profession Feeling valued supported and listened to were the over riding perspectives There appeared to be confusion about data collection and RCS as many respondents did not report their data to a lead PNA The process of receiving restorative clinical supervision and careers conversations required more clarity to understand if when and how progress was being made throughout the process For example some nurses indicated their first time experiences of RCS were surrounded with uncertainty especially if they were asked to attend supervision with little explanation beforehand This left some nurses describing their offloading of issues rather than being active participants in a process leading towards greater resilience We have suggested that this is an area for further research CONCLUSION The support of experienced nurses PNAs in practice helps nurses feel valued and empowered in some cases RCS and career conversations are enabling nurses who might otherwise leave the profession to stay The programme has opened opportunities for nurses to engage in further study and development following the programme These factors are important in the context of a global workforce retention crisis The A EQUIP model can be accomplished through good Nursing leadership at site level to assist the implementation of the model with PNAs supporting this role out The intention to implement requires a solid commitment and not contingent on the perfect conditions The prerequisite conditions must be considered and well thought out during implementation to include time for RCS and PNAs to carry out the role private space to conduct the RCS sessions and good communication regarding the plans to involve the key people Finally despite some of the issues identified the creation of a PNA movement through the development of the national programme has created much needed support for nurses and is the transformative element of nurse empowerment and greater satisfaction at work RECOMMENDATIONS Prior to the PNA Programme the delivery of restorative support and clinical supervision for nurses was not well developed despite some pockets of good practice Learning from the areas good practice developed through the programme must be adopted across England Regional and site Lead PNAs require more time to drive the PNA Programme strategy juggling many other priorities which create challenges for implementation at site level There is much learning that could be shared across each wave of roll out to avoid replication in the development of work and the energy needed to deliver the programme Disparity in the PNA Programme assessment strategy across HEIs and the requirement for work based learning in current NHS pressures requires an agreement for parity for of assessments at Level Adequate time release of nurses and access to office space privacy is needed for PNAs to facilitate RCS and career conversations these elements at site level are critical to sustain the programme delivery More work is needed to develop and promote all elements of the A EQUIP model in practice particularly quantifiable improvements in patient care arising from QI work Further understanding regarding if how progress is enabled through the RCS model is needed This we suggest is an important area for further research to clearly articulate the benefits to the individuals and teams over time INTRODUCTION The Professional Nurse Advocate PNA programme is a clinical and professional leadership programme delivered by Higher Education Institution HEI which equips nurses with the skills to deliver restorative clinical supervision to colleagues across England The programme has been gradually rolled out across England during with the aim of ensuring there will be PNAs in place to support colleagues in the following specialties Critical care Mental Health Adult Acute Children and Young Peoples inpatient settings Community Learning Disabilities Adult Children and Young People Safeguarding Health Criminal Justice settings HCJ International Nurses The Professional Nurse Advocate PNA is a leadership and advocacy role designed to support nurses to deliver safe and effective practice A key aspect of this model is to teach nurses to deliver restorative clinical supervision in their areas of practice The implementation of this program across nursing aims to support delivery of the long term plan for the NHS and enable recovery and restoration following the COVID Pandemic It also supports delivery of the following CNO objectives to support health and wellbeing of Nurses Compliance with IPC procedures Nursing workforce attract retain and celebrate nurses PNA training provides those on the programme with skills to facilitate restorative supervision to their colleagues and teams in nursing and beyond A version of this programme exists already for maternity colleagues where outcomes point to improved staff wellbeing and retention alongside improved patient outcomes Restorative supervision was first introduced in the health visiting workforce in the UK at a time of fragile professional identity Wallbank Throughout the literature it is described broadly as a safe space to express professional anxieties and share new ideas to improve roles and coping in the workplace The restorative supervision process acknowledges personal emotions and helps staff to work through containment strategies to restore their thinking in practice situations The restorative supervision that PNAs deliver is integral to their training and starts as soon as their time on the programme begins The training equips them to listen and to understand challenges and demands of fellow colleagues and to lead support and deliver quality improvement initiatives in response The course content of PNA training focuses first and foremost on restorative supervision Beyond this the focus is on the four functions of the Advocating for Education and Quality and Improvement A EQUIP Model These four functions are as follows Clinical Supervision Restorative Monitoring Evaluation and Quality Control Normative Personal Action for Quality Improvement Education and Development Formative Benefits of the A Equip model include providing a framework for the consistent delivery of effective and psychological safe clinical supervision delivering professional development at level Masters level with recognised national qualification in leadership and advocacy equipping Nurses to ensure continuous quality improvement in practice During February NHSE sought an evaluation of the PNA programme A research team from Coventry University were commissioned to undertake this work This report sets out the methods activities findings and recommendations as requested by commissioners BACKGROUND The PNA programme launched in March towards the end of the third wave of COVID This was the start of a critical point for recovery in the NHS for patients for services and for the nursing workforce The covid pandemic added complexity to care delivery through new ways of working and by stretching the capacity of the nursing workforce The PNA programme provided an opportunity to re build resilience and promote retention through adequate support in the form of the A EQUIP model The evaluation specified four separate work packages to include the following stages Document the baseline before the PNA programme Evaluate the PNA model Assess the usefulness of using one or all elements of the model and the perceived impact and outcomes Restorative clinical supervision specifically evaluation of the perceived benefits The evaluation is theory driven throughout all evaluation activities incorporate elements to develop and refine the programme theory This process will explicate the role of programme implementation activities and describe assumptions about how these are intended to achieve specific intermediate and distal outcomes AIM To undertake an evaluation of the impact of the Professional Nurse Advocates PNA programme on the PNAs and wider impact of PNAs in a team with recommendations for improvements OBJECTIVES I Create the logic model programme theory of change to explain the programme implementation activities II Conduct a rapid review of the emerging PNA literature III Evaluate baseline data across organisations participating in the PNA programme IV Assess factors impacting on the delivery of the PNA programme V Describe individual perceptions of PNAs and influencing contextual factors VI Describe individual perceptions of nurses receiving restorative supervision VII Assess the usefulness of one or all elements of the model implementation activities and describe assumptions essential to delivery VIII Evaluate the perceived benefits of restorative supervision plus enablers and barriers IX Provide recommendations based on the findings about how the programme can be effectively embedded implemented and sustained across all nursing contexts settings and services EVALUATION DESIGN A mixed methods approach was deployed to assess the impact of the PNA programme on PNAs nurses receiving restorative supervision and the wider impact of the PNAs within a team and across healthcare organisations To provide a theory based approach we applied the key concepts of Empowerment via the Laschinger et al Model and the Logic Model theory of programme change McCawley The study team met weekly and used a participatory action learning approach to adjust approaches as indicated throughout the evaluation Empowerment Theory Laschinger s Model Figure enabled the development of study questions and survey design aimed at the exploration of structural psychological empowerment and indicators of positive work feelings It also helped to achieve a balance of questions across each element of the Laschinger s framework and to align with programme inputs activities and outputs We examined the impact of restorative clinical supervision on nurse empowerment at both the individual and nursing community level Figure Laschinger s Model of Empowerment Structural Empowerment Psychological Empowerment Positive Work Feelings Job Opportunity Meaning satisfaction Information Confidence Commitment Support Autonomy Trust Resources Impact Low burnout Formal power Informal power This framework for understanding workplace empowerment was proposed by Laschinger et al after expanding an existing model by Kanter through the addition of psychological empowerment This helps to explain some the intervening processes necessary to achieve positive work feelings Laschinger s work states workplace empowerment structures employees experience feelings of personal empowerment that in turn reduces job strain and increases job satisfaction The strong relationship between structural empowerment and psychological empowerment supports Kanter s claim that social structural factors in the workplace are important conditions for empowering employees to accomplish their work Laschinger et al p Empowerment theory is imperative for this evaluation to enable understanding of if how the PNA programme with its information resources through the A EQUIP model supports PNAs participation and the delivery of restorative clinical supervision for nurses We also considered Christen s model of empowerment to further understand the possible relational elements also at play through the introduction of the PNA programme within the social structures contexts of the workplace Being connected with other people the collective engagement generated by being part of a social movement the programme are recognised in this model to develop greater fulfilment and empowerment This was considered throughout our analysis to understand if how any relational aspects between PNAs and RCS nurses help to empower staff in the workplace Programme Theory The aim of the Programme Theory Logic Model is to describe the major features required to implement the PNA programme and if how these influence the achievement of the change Figure To evaluate the features of the PNA programme how this is envisaged to work and works in practice we applied the Logic Model at the outset to guide key areas for our development of evaluation questions Following data collection and interpretation we mapped the multiple programme inputs and outputs to revisit our assumptions and pathways Figure The Logic Model of Programme Change Inputs Activities Outputs Outcomes Impact Assumptions Assumptions Assumptions Assumptions By understanding the likely assumptions of the programme theory and the interdependencies we can determine which factors or elements supported or hindered the implementation outcomes of the PNA programme Ethical Approval This evaluation gained research ethics approval via Coventry University Ref P Appendix page DATA COLLECTION

Education Institution with responsibility for delivering the education of the professional nurse advocates RAPID LITERATURE REVIEW The review is focussed on empowerment and nurses with the aim of informing the evaluation and the study team to deepen understanding of the concept of empowerment in the context of nursing workforce through the PNA role The review scope and protocol were produced LLD and refined by study team AC NB MK with further review feedback by NHSE commissioners Appendix pages The Rapid Review was conducted using a group methodology with study team members to expedite the process This was a pragmatic process which sought to establish the bottom line evidence most useful for the purposes set out in the protocol Typical systematised review techniques tools PRISMA RAYYAN software were engaged with expertise of information services CEBIS to systematically search relevant evidence databases MeSH and identify the highest quality evidence Appendix pages SURVEY Using the Model of Empowerment a survey Appendix pages was designed SP in collaboration with team to explore the impact on perceptions and levels of empowerment with all PNAs and nurses who have delivered or received restorative clinical supervision The survey was created using Jisc Online Surveys www onlinesurveys ac uk CASE STUDIES Case study organisations in different settings provided the opportunity to undertake a deep dive of pertinent information at individual sites areas related to PNAs PNAs in training delivery of restorative supervision and nurse workforce retention issues These were conducted using mixed methods in two parts Firstly an analysis of baseline data collected via a short survey to generate insight into their starting point before implementation of the PNA programme and inputs leading to PNA implementation Access to the survey was created through a QR code using free online software www qr code generator com Secondly invitations were extended to HEI Leads and PNA Site Leads for interview using a brief protocol and interview schedule Appendix pages Interviews were audio recorded and conducted using two study team members LLD and RK ALL INTERVIEWS We explored the implementation of the PNA programme from multiple stakeholder perspectives to understand views on the successes challenges and learning for future implementation and sustainability This was an in depth qualitative phase involving semi structured interviews single and joint with the following staff groups Higher Education Institute leads for the PNA course HEI Regional Leads PNAs Site Lead PNAs Nurses in PNA roles PNAs Nurses who have received restorative clinical supervision RCS Sampling across settings and contexts we adopted a sampling approach to achieve maximum variation so that we were able to access a wide range of views and perspectives We included staff working in District General Hospitals Community trusts large Acute Trusts and Mental Health Trusts and speciality areas Appendix page For the PNAs we explored Perceptions of the PNA programme benefits limitations Expectations of the PNA programme personal organisational strategic Experiences of being a PNA Enablers and barriers to the PNA role using theory of change to explore For the nurses receiving restorative clinical supervision we explored The perceived benefits and usefulness of the supervision Barriers and facilitators in the model used Contextual factors How their experience could be improved MAPPING ONTO THE LOGIC MODEL Discussions with the National PNA team helped the study team to establish the necessary detail for the Logic Model Inputs activities outputs and desired outcomes were then mapped with the indicators anticipated to best judge success using the overall structure created by the PNA team at NHS England Table For simplicity of the mapping envisaged pathways of the PNA are displayed as high level and linear The reality is of complex interactions between different organisational pathways and at different levels throughout On the logic model blue arrows indicate interactions involving two or more parties sometimes from different health and education settings working in partnership together Finally assumptions underpinning the model have been stated which are critical to the achievement of the outcomes This model has been used to aid the development of all study questions and to decide the data collection stages It was revisited during data analysis to aid the interpretation of our findings from the viewpoints of the groups of stakeholders pathways to fully explore the transactional and interactive elements This enabled appreciative reporting of the real world factors involved in delivery of the PNA programme to show successful pathways and where adjustment would be indicated for long term sustainability DEVELOPMENT OF THE EVALUATION QUESTIONS FOR EACH WORK PACKAGE Evaluation questions were developed for all groups of participants with each aligned to the evaluation objectives and empowerment theory This process served to demonstrate differences and overlap in questions and to align with topics for each participant group Oversight and feedback were provided by the PNA management team Appendix pages Extensive background reading of literature MK and LLD from the Professional Midwife Advocate programme expanded our understanding of Empowerment and its Agency regarding how this might relate to the realisation of the PNA programme Questions were piloted with volunteers known to the evaluation team representing two participant groups namely nurses and PNAs Several questions were adjusted in accordance with the team member s expertise to make the questions acceptable AC and NB The questions were developed into comprehensive interview schedules for the five participant groups an example of a schedule for the PNA group largest group of participants is included Appendix pages Interviews were

group Stevenson et al to enable members of the evaluation team LLD AC NB and MK to work collaboratively and to expedite this review The CAT approach is well established to identify best evidence to use in practice settings Good practice stems from the volume of people involved in the process discussion and sense checking throughout to determine a consistent review process CEBIS expertise employed enabled the judicious choice of databases and platforms used to conduct the rapid review and for eligibility criteria to be carefully considered to inform decisions Initial topic scoping

Strengths and Limitations There was a dearth of evidence regarding empowerment the PNA Programme PNAs and RCS for Nurses The available literature showed a lack of fundamental data to critically appraise Nevertheless this review has demonstrated the gaps in the evidence base and enabled us to fulfil our intention of building our understanding and a framework to aid our analytical process Critical Appraisal Appraisal of the papers was conducted as follows Individual critical appraisal by AC and LLD using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme CASP Qualitative Review Tool During this stage a decision was taken not to exclude papers due to the dearth of literature A quality review was undertaken by AC using a quality review tool for disparate papers by Hawker et al Scores for papers ranged from out of a possible maximum of Appendix pages Given the dearth of literature no cut off point for exclusion e g due to poor quality was applied The most limiting factor of this review of quality stems from no primary data through research being available Bottom Line Evidence Five papers shaped the findings relating to empowerment with PNAs and RCS Nurses Empowerment is an extensive term in this review it broadly relates to knowledge gained from the PNA Programme and enablement of support strategies and learning through A EQUIP model with RCS nurses Laschinger s Model encompasses structural psychological and positive work feelings Laschinger states Psychological empowerment is defined as the psychological state that employees must experience for empowerment interventions to be successful Laschinger et al p It is posited that empowerment is experienced through the PNA Programme and A Equip model Thereafter the model creates the opportunity for a relationship between PNAs to form and to promote empowerment of Nurses receiving RCS through the delivery of restorative interactions Factors contributing to structural empowerment arise from supportive mechanisms taught on the PNA Programme and taking the opportunity for RCS Having enough time is an important factor related to individual empowerment experience and the delivery of restorative clinical supervision and is referred to throughout Hence although not explicit it would be disempowering if time were not available Encouraging positive work feelings are reported as feeling motivated by PNAs and the RCS process and being able to help others in a reciprocal relationship which involves the whole team The presence of a model for clinical supervision is empowering and makes nurses feel valued Supervisory relationships on an individual level create a sense of person centeredness and being listened to Moreover this process may help to empower nurses to remain in practice Psychological empowerment was reported as raising self awareness to regulate less positive learnt nurse behaviours and encourage more positive interactions Although the PNA programme and empowerment is not reported in sufficient detail to draw conclusions empowerment is a feature n referred to individually and structurally as a positive influence upon well being Notable by its absence was any reporting related to empowerment as it relates to improved patient care by nurses Muscat et al Mahati Foster Griffiths and Pearce Conclusion This review is limited to the experiential and anecdotal published evidence available which indicated that RCS delivered through the PNA Programme should be able to decrease stress and burnout Empowerment arises from RCS to support nurses time to contemplate different perspectives of issues and helps inform their onward decision making These results were founded through discussions reflective conversations supportive challenge and open and honest feedback Empowerment can be expressed as as improved knowledges of collective leadership and the power of being involved in quality improvement has given them a better understanding and appreciation of the PNA role with its many benefits While the quality of evidence is weak it provides justification for evaluating the impact of the programme and the potential for empowerment as a derivative THE SURVEY Introduction This section describes the methods and findings of the online survey The survey was designed to address key aspects of the evaluation requirement document It aimed to evaluate key stakeholders perceptions of restorative clinical supervision RCS and their perceived effectiveness in meeting their published roles and responsibilities Methods An electronic survey was developed and distributed via Joint Information Systems Committee JISC Online Surveys Appendix pages An introductory email which included a link to the electronic survey was distributed by NHS England via email to three constituent groups I Nurses who received RCS II PNAs III Trust PNA Leads For the purposes of brevity these groups will be referred to as RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust Leads throughout the remainder of this chapter Study information a privacy notice and explicit informed consent was integrated into the survey Participants were unable to progress to the main survey without confirming their consent There was an initial under representation of RCS Nurses responding to the survey so an amendment to ethical approval was secured to ask PNAs to advertise the survey to RCS Nurses that they had supervised The survey was also advertised during an online event hosted by NHS England These steps were successful in securing more responses from RCS st th Nurses The survey opened on August and closed on December A copy of the survey is available in Appendix X The survey was developed and amended in collaboration with members of the evaluation team and the NHS England NHSE team who commissioned the evaluation and it was thoroughly piloted before being launched The main sections of the survey were as follows About you Basic demographic information was collected to provide context to the analysis This included the region of England and field of nursing in which respondents worked age gender ethnicity and disability and time since completion of their nurse education and whether their nurse education was conducted outside of the United Kingdom UK Answers to all questions were required although all had Prefer not to say and Other options where appropriate About RCS Answers to all questions in this section were compulsory Questions were constructed to address the different components of the Model of Empowerment by Laschinger et al Laschinger et al s model was the key framework selected for the wider evaluation and was used as the basis for understanding the effectiveness of RCS The model contains a total of items arranged in domains and is summarised in Figure page A positively worded statement related to each of the items was constructed and respondents were asked to state their level of agreement with each of the statements on a item Likert scale ranging from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree This section was prefaced with a definition and explanation of RCS as described by NHS England NHS Innovation An additional five statements were added to this section in response to suggestions from the research and NHSE I teams during development and piloting These addressed the effectiveness of RCS in helping to improve the safety of patient care delivery the ability to make changes to care delivery networking with others the influence nurses have in their practice and the leadership of quality improvement Answers to all questions were required A second section about RCS was presented at the end of the survey This asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement with the statement I believe that restorative clinical supervision is effective using the same item Likert scale as before This provided an overall rating of the effectiveness of RCS Finally respondents were asked to indicate the main benefits of RCS what could be improved about RCS and how those improvements could be implemented using open text responses Again answers were required to all questions although responses could be brief Perceived effectiveness in meeting roles responsibilities The questions in this section were based on the published roles and responsibilities relevant to each of the three groups RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust Leads Statements related to the respondent s perceived effectiveness in meeting each of their published roles and responsibilities Critical Care Networks National Nurse Leads were created Respondents were then asked to state their level of agreement with each statement using the same item Likert scale as before All questions in this section were compulsory Additional evaluation The final section provided an optional open text box for any other comments that respondents wanted to add and an opportunity to leave their contact details if they were happy to be contacted by the evaluation team to discuss the PNA programme in more detail Data analysis Demographic data were analysed and reported as total numbers and proportions for each group Likert scale items were converted to numbers for the purpose of analysis as follows Strongly agree Moderately agree Slightly agree Slightly disagree Moderately disagree Strongly disagree These were treated as ordinal scale data for the purposes of analysis and median interquartile range IQR were used to summarise responses for each of the groups Open text responses were analysed from RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust PNA Leads who responded to the evaluation survey providing their insights regarding the benefits improvements and how the improvements identified for the RCS process could be implemented Most data comprised very short responses of several words Data were extracted into a Microsoft Word document and through reading familiarised Each response was open coded and a list of characteristics for each made to form descriptions and coding book Further reading of whole content across all responses from each question and participant group comparing between RCS Nurse PNA and Trust PNA Lead s data enabled identification of connections and divergence between characteristics Synthesis was guided according to the emergent characteristics to form overarching themes This analytical process was used to keep an open mind regarding the possibilities particularly in relation to the development of potential adaptations to the A EQUIP model delivery or enriching the Empowerment Theory as this relates to the PNA Programme Three central themes were identified as Conditions necessary for RCS Nurse participation engagement and Organisational commitment to RCS in the A EQUIP Model and Reflections on and Reinvigoration from RCS As such they represent three phases of delivery namely before during and afterwards Results About you There were responses to the survey RCS Nurses n PNAs n Trust Leads n The demographics of respondents in each group are detailed in Table There was a fairly even representation from the different English regions and most respondents worked in adult nursing There was a greater proportion of RCS Nurses in the younger age categories compared to PNAs and Trust Leads although the proportions in the years of age category were similar across all three groups The samples were predominantly female and mainly identified as white ethnicity RCS Nurse respondents were more ethnically diverse than PNAs and Trust Leads The proportions declaring a disability were similar across the three groups Trust Leads and PNAs tended to be qualified for longer and were more likely to have been educated in the UK than RCS Nurses Indeed none of the Trust Leads reported that they had received their nurse education outside of the UK Survey items RCS PNAs Trust

Additional evaluation A consistently high proportion of respondents in each group indicated that they were happy to be contacted by the evaluation team to discuss the PNA programme in more detail RCS Nurses PNAs Trust Leads OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS Three primary themes were identified within the open ended questions in the survey each having three interconnected characteristics most identified by RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust Leads Theme Conditions necessary for RCS Theme Nurse Participation Engagement Organisational Commitment to RCS in the A EQUIP Model Theme Reflection and Reinvigoration from RCS Theme Conditions necessary for RCS This theme comprised of three characteristics namely adequate time provision a safe space and adequate communications Three perspectives of safe space related to the provision of offices using Microsoft Teams and engaging in group supervision The density of responses throughout each is focussed on time and a provision of a safe space Adequate Time Most RCS Nurse respondents indicated they were given adequate time to participate in RCS This was described as having time or being given time many RCS responses This meant that the process of establishing a time for RCS whilst on duty had been successfully facilitated by the ward managers and PNAs For some RCS Nurses frustrations were expressed regarding not having time allocated and not being released from their clinical shift or duties or with adequate cover provided to allow them to leave the clinical area Rostered time to participate in RCS needs adequate cover Together with this needing identified protected time many RCS responses was a frequently cited Once in RCS sessions on occasions the time allocated was not sufficient to enable issues to be explored or conducive to the topics being discussed Being released from duties to participate was not reflective of all responses and seems contingent on the model used e g ad hoc sessions scheduled sessions and regularly scheduled sessions Hence most satisfaction was expressed where RCS was a regular activity and dates were in place for future sessions RCS Nurse Some RCS nurses recommended an increase in PNA provision was needed although this was not generalised across the data that increased PNA capacity was needed to deliver enough RCS sessions and would enable nurses to book as when needed RCS Nurse One RCS Nurse expressed that with so few PNAs on one site this delivering RCS might overload and add stress for PNAs RCS Nurse Nevertheless emotional labour was not a feature described by PNAs It seems that the system for identifying nurses or enabling nurses to book RCS in some areas requires further refinement In contrast to RCS Nurses relatively few PNAs felt they were satisfied with having enough time to deliver RCS Different perspectives of time were described by PNAs regarding contingent conditions such as pressures of day job and unmanageable competing priorities alongside their clinical roles time to undertake this role as currently PNA role is secondary to my main clinical role and trust hospital still have not allocated any time identified to undertake role unless in own time PNA And this situation was similarly reflected by PNA site leads RCS can t be done when overwhelmed with current workload covering sickness or shortages of staff on other wards PNA Lead Satisfaction was expressed by PNAs regarding being able to support career development PNA and for being able to carry out structured planning to address issues raised through RCS sessions PNA in relation to the A EQUIP Model Having enough time is a hugely important factor in relation to the delivery of the PNA model and one of the key conditions identified This is epitomised by some PNAs who felt without adequate time they were losing their skills and confidence to deliver RCS This situation is also familiar to sites leads Many PNAs are not using valuable knowledge and skills acquired through their training to support colleagues we will lose our PNA skills Furthermore PNAs are always in the numbers like other clinicians because their role is not formally recognized PNA Lead PNAs were very keen to deliver a service for their nurses through the A EQUIP Model They were enjoying the role of being a PNA but this was outweighed by the significant volume of responses which indicated issues in the delivery of the model Some issues relate to having protected and recognised time or freeing of time for example Been given the time and space to do the supervision I no longer do it because my trust doesn t give me any time and having done it in my own time for a year I refuse to do so any longer PNA PNAs were concerned that they could not always deliver the service and balance this with their current work demands Staff are keen to access the service but it is not always possible due to my working commitments and demands with patients so staff need time to be able to access the RCS and we need more time to deliver this PNA A Safe Space A private space in a calm area to create a relaxed environment for the planned RCS session was overwhelmingly identified as a pre requisite factor This enabled nurses to speak openly during the RCS sessions and for most this was expressed as a very positive experience many RCS Nurses The nurse s privacy and confidentiality were articulated as being paramount to engagement in the RCS process RCS Nurse On occasions for some RCS was interrupted through pagers or other staff needing the office space RCS Nurse which made the circumstances unsuitable and left some nurses feeling vulnerable and reluctant to participate RCS Nurse Hence a safe space was not always guaranteed and depended on the availability of rooms often on the day Confidentiality and trust were raised as important benefits of RCS and related to safe space being able to speak to someone who is not necessarily in a line manager position and have confidence in the confidentiality of the conversation RCS Nurse Several nurses suggested RCS should always be delivered by PNAs that are not familiar to themselves several RCS responses to ensure authenticity and confidentiality Again this associates the need to feel safe in the safe space Nevertheless other RCS nurses described being familiar with PNAs from their ward team and the issue regarding familiarity was not cited The solution is possibly to have the choice of PNA regardless of the where they are based and this requires organisation and communication in advance of RCS sessions While using Microsoft Teams and other digital platforms were necessary to enable participation during the COVID pandemic this did not suit some RCS Nurses Preference for face to face sessions was expressed by several nurses who had experienced RCS via Microsoft Teams stating this was not conducive to feel real and purposeful RCS Nurse Assumptions were made by some PNAs regarding RCS Nurse s access to personal computers or work offices or privacy if working remotely Consequently inadequate access to computers and lack of privacy diminished finding a safe space and undermined delivery of some RCS sessions Using Microsoft Teams for RCS needs careful consideration to take account of these factors Some RCS nurses indicated that group supervision was favoured which is described as providing a structured opportunity to share ideas and make suggestions several RCS Nurses RCS nurses enjoyed being with other nurse colleagues in a similar position and listening to others was a process of realisation One nurse stated that things that had bothered me and I hadn t looked at them were able to be examined by others with similar experience RCS Nurse The ideal group situation was described as where mutual feelings can be expressed in a safe environment RCS Nurse Group reflection was sometimes structured through clinical and management scenarios from practice where the discussion unpacked a different perspective helped to see what other colleagues would have done differently or what I saw differently in the scenario and sometimes thinking about this afterwards RCS Nurse Once again safe space was cited but this time as needing a safe open space established with trusted ground rules RCS Nurse Skilled facilitation and trust is a critical success factor for group supervision Finding a safe space was mentioned relatively little by PNAs it seemed to be a minor irritation for some and particularly where space cannot be booked in advance PNA A safe space was presented as beneficial in the context of its purpose to constructively use time safe convenient space conducive for staff RCS to explore their thoughts and form a plan PNA PNAs reflected that they appreciated the need for safe space and that this was a pre requisite when arranging RCS sessions Adequate communication regarding RCS Most RCS Nurses were fundamentally satisfied with their experience of RCS which left them feeling positive and looking forward to continuing the process Information was generally disseminated from PNAs via email or face to face contacts For these RCS Nurses they felt very well informed I was told it RCS was booked about three weeks in advance it was on the e roster and I knew it was something different to the usual pop into the office with my manager RCS Nurse Some RCS Nurses however were apprehensive about RCS because there was little or no communications about sessions Consequently these nurses were left unclear about what RCS entailed or what was expected from them during RCS Several RCS Nurses describe being sent for supervision and that using this approach changes perspective of RCS from a supportive activity to management Suggestions to improve this included being told in advance and given information using NHS Trust communications briefings via the Intranet and Newsletters to promote the benefits of RCS and the production of information leaflets Theme Nurse Participation Engagement Organisational Commitment to RCS in the A EQUIP Model In this theme nurses describe their understanding of participation in restorative clinical supervision how mechanisms and structures for this are enacted at site level Two key characteristics of this theme were identified as growing appreciation of the benefits of RCS and issues with local frameworks for delivery at site level Growing Appreciation of the Benefits of RCS The A EQUIP model is starting to spread throughout healthcare organisations and become recognised by Nurses as a structured emotional supportive mechanism through RCS Where needed Nurses are accessing PNA support to resolve practice issues they find difficult to address RCS enables openness in safe space to generate discussion and potential self related actions and others which could improve their practice Depending on the level of confidence and experience practice solutions could be actioned by the nurse receiving RCS or PNA s and Lead PNAs Nurses receiving RCS state that the process legitimises access to support especially when needed The RCS model is viewed as a positive benefit to support nurses in clinical practice A RCS Nurse explained can help you see things from a different perspective when discussing the tough issues While another RCS Nurse appreciated the challenge for example matters related to work are opened up that could either hinder or push me to improve but they do push me to improve the way I approach work Some PNAs compared the A EQUIP Model to their previous supervision roles of years ago and expressed clear support and understanding stating for the difference stating this is different to the traditional formal learning and development of clinical supervision PNA The PNAs suggested their role is focussed on constructive behaviours and a restorative approach for nurses who are experiencing significant emotional demands The A EQUIP Model has made Lead PNAs and PNAs more aware of the need to take time to consider the wellbeing of staff Helping colleagues to have good work life balance helping colleagues to offload their anxiety enabling colleagues to feel emotionally restored after and contribute to job satisfaction in the workplace Lead PNA The PNAs reported positively throughout regarding the benefits of the model and their personal realisations about using the model The responses relate to passion for being part of the programme and being able to use their experience in nursing through the RCS process Issues regarding local frameworks for delivery at site level This theme is represented by characteristics which relate to being able to make changes in their role having enough time feeling valued and respected taken seriously by management and supported to implement the model of A EQUIP Amongst the responses which indicated many improvements are needed in local delivery there is much positive feedback from RCS Nurses and PNAs coupled with a sense of needing to test out processes especially for newcomers RCS Nurses indicated that although they were very satisfied with the sessions they attended making changes in practice was an aspect they felt to be lacking and would benefit from being followed up after supervision to give reassurance that for example something will change to make it better RCS Nurse Some RCS Nurses apportioned their suggestions to improve matters regarding change to Managerial level of staff for example Managers need to fix things RCS Nurse and similarly some PNAs felt managers were not as well engaged as they should be managers should be better engaged with the process and purpose of RCS PNA While the type of manager needed to effect change is not indicated a reasonable assumption is of ward managers or matrons Taking ownership and responsibility is part of the RCS process but this is also a learning process and for most RCS is relatively new If RCS is relatively infrequent this increases the anxiety that nothing will change Notwithstanding making change happen following RCS requires confidence agency and the authority to act and may need further support from more senior staff in the process to effect change PNAs are keen to see the engagement of middle senior and corporate level Nurses to improve the strategy for delivery of A EQUIP There was a huge proliferation of responses to indicate that although the model is working in some areas very many PNAs felt unsupported in its implementation we ve been left to set up the service on our own which wasn t what I signed up for when I did the course PNA Despite this some Lead PNAs cited enjoying setting up the service and that had dedicated time to do this I don t have much time but I am following the example of others to set up the service as best as I can I could always do more with more time Lead PNA Some PNAs expressed their frustrations about senior management supporting them and the difficulties in keeping a service going at busy times Time to attend RCS should be mandated as when its busy it s the first thing to be cancelled PNA There were many references to needing more visibility of very senior Nurses and needing to feel that they understand and value the PNA and RCS function of their role one person stated Senior Nursing management not taking the role seriously they seem to be paying lip service and switching the RCS on and off according to how busy we are Surely if we are busy and pressure is on this is when we need to ensure continuity of the delivery of RCS and investing in the role to support our nurses PNA Finally some PNAs cited not feeling valued and not respected for what they do by the Trust management This is illustrated by a quote from a PNA effective leadership within Trust they need to support this and respect us currently undertaken in addition to other roles with no allocated time PNA In summary in cases where time was not given to PNAs along with the support needed to set up and deliver the A EQUIP model PNAs felt devalued or overlooked by the most senior nurses where they work Theme Reflection and Reinvigoration from RCS The process of RCS legitimises the time and necessity for Nurses to be enabled to reflect and understand difficult perspectives in their roles it seems this process gradually changes thinking about individual work based issues or those which are affected by team members or personal matters This is a rewarding activity for RCS nurses and PNAs Many described RCS as a time to offload or unload issues and this alone helped them to feel relieved To key characteristics of this theme are the reflective process needed and the reinvigoration possible A reflective process Some RCS Nurses describe being less able to instantaneously offload issues and needing time to reflect on the process of RCS to prepare them for the next time Others indicate they are learning about what RCS entails and how to make it beneficial to them and their practice afterwards The development of trust is also a prerequisite to authenticity in the RCS process To really benefit from RCS I need to have confidence that the person I am sharing things with is going to keep my confidences RCS Nurse Being able to begin reflection as part of RCS however is contingent on having a safe space which enables open conversations and issues to be explored Hence RCS cannot be assumed to be an instant hit engagement in the process is contingent on satisfaction regarding the necessary conditions underpinned by a trusting relationship RCS is a Reinvigorating Experience Participating in RCS was described as a positive and constructive experience by very many RCS Nurses and is where the density of responses is concentrated These respondents expressed that no changes were needed to RCS and that they were very happy or want more RCS Nurses described their experience as facilitated structured conversations with debriefs towards solutions None of the respondents provided negative feedback about their RCS experience For a very small minority they identified it was not for them and that it is what it is And some respondents were unsure about the process expressing that they have only had limited access to RCS or they will see how they feel next time RCS Nurses enthusiastically described how RCS has encouraged them to think differently about problems This boosted their self confidence during and had an impact after sessions leaving them to feel more restored Final remarks provided by RCS Nurses offered a proliferation of positive feedback regarding PNAs support knowledge and experience The following example is provided as representative of the feelings expressed My PNA is based in they are someone I know and trust deeply They made me feel valued and empowered to change things I have control of and to take the positives out of situations where they are not always obvious It RCS has been a fabulous experience so far RCS Nurse The leadership perspective to support RCS and PNAs stems from the awareness of what of could be achieved when the number of PNAs reach the optimum level to deliver RCS There needs to be more opportunities for RCS and this can only be addressed as more PNAs are trained Lead PNA DISCUSSION Many of the characteristics of survey respondents seem to be broadly representative of the wider Nursing workforce However it should be noted that it was particularly difficult to recruit RCS Nurses and alternative recruitment strategies had to be implemented to try to access this group This was eventually effective in recruiting Nurse respondents but it is not known if those responding differed from the wider population of Nurses who have received RCS It was also notable that we recruited considerably fewer RCS Nurses n than PNAs n Given the focus of the PNA programme on supporting Nurses in their roles RCS Nurses would ideally have been the largest cohort recruited The initial gate keeping role of NHSE in approaching potential survey participants may have hindered access to this group as those who initially received details of the survey are likely to have been at a more strategic level i e Trust Leads The information may therefore not have been effectively cascaded to PNAs to reach RCS Nurses Indeed evidence from some of the interviews conducted as part of the evaluation suggested that survey details were specifically not disseminated more widely due to factors such as service demands and other ongoing staff surveys It is recommended that future evaluations of the PNA programme should develop and implement an additional range of recruitment strategies to specifically target Nurses receiving RCS see Appendix pages for explanation of recruitment strategies implemented in this study Nursing and Midwifery Council membership data NMC has reported that of registrants were of White ethnicity were of Asian Black Mixed race or Other ethnicity and didn t declare or preferred not to say Across all hospital and community services in NHS England of the nursing midwifery and health visitor workforce reported being from a White ethnicity BME black and minority ethnic and Unknown Our data is likely to have been broadly representative of these figures although it was noticeable that ethnic diversity differed across the three groups For example of RCS Nurses who responded to our survey reported being from an Asian British Asian Black African Caribbean Black British or Mixed Multiple ethnic groups background but this proportion fell to of PNAs and just of Trust Leads This change in ethnic diversity with seniority has been identified previously For example the proportion of nurses midwives and health visitors from a BME background was reported to drop from at Agenda for Change AfC Band to at Band and at Band NHS England The PNA programme team Regional Leads Trust Leads and others should reflect carefully on these trends and implement strategies to enhance equality diversity and inclusion regarding appointment to PNA and Trust Lead roles NMC data reported that of registrants reported their gender as Male which is very comparable to the proportions reported in the Nurse group in the current survey It was interesting that the proportion of males fell to of PNAs and of Trust Leads NMC also reported that of registrants were in adult nursing in children s in learning disability and in mental health These proportions are again very comparable to the figures in each of the three samples recruited to our survey The samples are therefore likely to be broadly representative of the wider Nursing workforce on the basis of these characteristics In of the NHS workforce were registered as having a disability on the Electronic Staff Record The proportion self reporting a disability on the NHS survey was much higher however at NHS England The proportion of respondents reporting a disability in our survey ranged from of RCS Nurses to of Trust leads Given the anonymous nature of our survey it might be expected that the reported disability rate might be closer to that of the NHS survey This may therefore indicate an under representation of respondents with disabilities in our survey although that cannot be verified RCS was generally viewed very positively by all three groups It should be noted however that more than of PNAs had yet to have experience of delivering RCS and this was reflected in some of the open text comments about not using skills Of those who had delivered RCS there was a very wide range of experience although the mean value of RCS Nurses supervised suggested good levels of experience It should be noted that this mean value will include both active and completed supervision so it is not clear from the survey results what the level of ongoing supervision might be The positivity around RCS was evident in terms of high median ratings for statements related to the model of empowerment Table and for the additional questions Table Respondents were particularly positive regarding their overall impression of the effectiveness of RCS with the median rating for this statement at the highest level of Strongly agree in all three groups Table Only one statement across all aspects of RCS received a median rating of Slightly agree and this was by PNAs in relation to Opportunity In conclusion however the overriding impression of RCS was very positive In general all three groups were also very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meeting their published roles and responsibilities Tables The only exception was RCS Nurses completion of the e learning module before their RCS sessions this was given a median rating of Moderately disagree RCS Nurses were also slightly less positive median rating of Slightly agree about their effectiveness in accessing a PNA and discussing with their line manager the timeframe for RCS sessions and implementation of the A EQUIP model It was notable that of the statements presented to RCS Nurses reached a maximum level of agreement of Strongly agree meaning that most respondents awarded this maximum rating for their perceived effectiveness PNAs were also very positive about their perceived effectiveness rating of statements at this highest level of agreement None were rated lower than Moderately agree by PNAs Finally Trust Leads were also positive about their perceived effectiveness The only items that were rated slightly less positively median rating of Slightly agree by Trust Leads related to ensuring arrangements for all nurses to have access to a PNA that PNAs have allocated time and that nurses are released to meet their PNA These are very important practical and workload related issues that might require closer consideration by the PNA programme team Regional Leads Trust Leads and others These issues were also very evident in the open text responses to the survey Overall however the three groups were very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meeting their roles and responsibilities CONCLUSION In summary the respondents to the survey were likely to have been broadly representative of the wider Nursing workforce although the response rate from RCS Nurses receiving RCS was sub optimal Overall RCS was viewed very positively by RCS Nurses PNAs and Trust Leads The three groups were also generally very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meeting their published roles and responsibilities although further work is required to support RCS Nurses to engage with the A EQUIP e learning module prior to RCS RCS Nurses were slightly less positive about accessing a PNA and discussing timeframes with their line manager Trust Leads were also slightly less positive about some of the practical aspects of ensuring access of nurses to PNAs allocated time for the PNA role and release of RCS Nurses to meet their PNA THE CASE STUDIES Introduction The perspectives of lead persons at Higher Education Institutes HEI and Lead PNAs at NHS settings across eight different geographical areas were sought to provide in depth contextually based information regarding the implementation of the professional nurse advocate programme This provided a view into individual organisational processes and necessary relationships between HEI and Healthcare settings to establish and recruit to PNA programmes and to deliver RCS Barriers and facilitators were explored and practice exemplars characterised Methods Potential participants were located and approached by the NHS England PNA team where the participant information was sent with our contact details Once an expression of interest was received by the study team from a prospective site direct contact was made by the PI Data collection involved two aspects a very short survey and semi structured interviews The survey link incorporated online consent and was sent via email This provided participants with the opportunity to share quantitative data regarding number of nurses at site number of PNAs and PNAs in training Replies were received to the survey address where selection and recruitment of sites began to ensure a maximum variation of size and geographical location Several sites cancelled interviews due to site pressures however a balanced geographical spread across England was achieved Approach and invitation for an interview was made via email with consent Data was collected through joint interviews RK and LLD using a selection of questions Appendix pages from the study schedule database Appendix pages Prompting questions were also used to stimulate further information if answers provided were brief Questions were iterated according to those that best generated most relevant data Interviews were conducted and recorded using Microsoft Teams each taking between and minutes During interviews extensive notes were made by RK which formed the first stage of sense making Debrief between RK and LLD followed each interview Organisation and management of the transcripts took place through framework approach Ritchie et al to enable data to be examined and easily retrieved from the sites Themes were derived from commonalities between HEI and Healthcare settings Results Geographical locations Case studies were conducted with eight sites spanning Healthcare and HEI settings across England Additional information from other HEI interviews conducted work package augmented our understanding of roles and responsibilities and these sites are also included on the map see Figure The reach of the HEIs in all cases extended beyond their geographical location and in some cases they were responsible for delivering PNA training across north to south of England Figure Geographical locations of case study sites and supplemental information Healthcare sites For healthcare settings the size of each Trust is indicated by the number of nurses in the workforce the number of trained PNAs and PNAs in training Table Further information regarding nursing waiting for entry to a programme was not always available note at November Healthcare Total Trained PNAs in training Nurses waiting Site Nurses at PNAs for PNA

sites NHS sites NHS sites Average Table Examples of Higher Education Institute delivery of PNA Programme Introduction to the qualitative data findings For most HEIs the PNA training module was established at great speed aided through experienced teaching staff For example some staff had experience of delivering leadership programmes and the professional midwife advocate programme enabling them to draw upon this knowledge to support the necessary pace and scale In healthcare settings the Covid Pandemic reassigned many people s roles with an appreciation of the need to take care of staff in such ill prepared transitions A participant described the context and the sense of urgency this created When Covid happened I realised we needed to do something for staff so within the first month of redeploying people I took on a central role setting up wellbeing champions to look after the nurses working in collaboration with occupation health and the psychology team to deliver wellbeing support I was approached to understand where PNAs could fit into this strategy and that s how it all started Lead PNA NHS For others there was an appreciation of needing to establish if where and how the PNA programme fitted into existing organisational support such as coaching and leadership work This meant understanding if the programme would plug perceived gaps in support and how best to engage staff with the idea for example I had a member of staff who came forward to test the programme they were in a leadership role but it was not until they had done the programme that we saw the uniqueness of it you know it s not the same as a QI course or management it s the EQUIP element that provides the difference and strong framework HEI Healthcare organisations initially relied upon speaking to PNAs to understand their impressions of the role This process cascaded enthusiasm from early adopters of the programme towards the successful national roll out despite issues encountered Three core themes spanned the qualitative data namely A Personal Commitment to Implement the PNA Programme PNA Module Characteristics and Programme Evolution and Outputs A personal commitment to implement the PNA Programme The HEI leads and lead PNAs described their roles regarding liaison with each other and the regional leads In cases where HEIs worked across multiple healthcare organisations this created vast administration responsibilities to ensure communications were timely and smooth for the enrolment of students Although clear frustrations were sometimes expressed regarding communications early adopters networked to share experience and tips Frustrations regarding the huge scale and pace of roll out created a sense of not being able to keep track of things adequately as illuminated there is no one single point of communication which created problems for the University and communications back to the healthcare organisation especially regarding starters or those who seem to have dropped off the radar it was a mess initially HEI Supportive structures processes and relationships to aid the implementation of the programme are emerging in healthcare organisations and being replicated across England through shared learning networks as seen in this example since we started compared to where we are now we do have the regional leads and I would say different regional leads seem to be more engaged than others with regards to being able to be our representative I will say I m concerned student X isn t attending you know and they re kind of like oh no they should be coming or I ll speak to their line manager that kind of level of interaction HEI Lead PNAs also expressed that there has been a steep learning curve where they have relied heavily on key members of senior nursing staff to develop their knowledge about how to organise and manage the roll out in healthcare settings In some areas there were issues regarding the appropriate selection of candidates for the programme but PNAs shared their insights regarding how to progress at pace while keeping staff engaged Three examples demonstrate experiences the differences and learning between early and a later waves of implementation An early wave participant the PNAs were trained and then told to go back to their organisations and implement the programme they were practice development nurses who did not have the agency in their role They were looking to me to provide the structure to say how to do it we are still creating that structure NHS An early wave participant Initially it was just self selection staff put themselves forward and that was due to the short turn around for enrolment literally we said by pm Now we are getting more oversight and support is needed from line managers We did pause all training at one point due to operational problems and inadequate information to participants regarding expectations from the training NHS A later wave participant I review all the applications to make sure each person is allocated a buddy as they go onto a training place We are looking at the spread of PNAs across the organisation nowadays much more than at first when we accepted any application or nomination As I lead I am also making sure I let them do their own stuff letting them get on with what works for them their teams We are still relatively early days but it feels like the right road Lead PNA NHS Throughout each interview participants shared their enthusiasm for the programme and the need to legitimise support for staff action learning and problem solving to forge forward summarised the situation PNA Module Characteristics Gradual Evolution The impression we gained is that HEIs needed to respond and react quickly to establish modules using a best fit approach e g to select an existing module and adapt this to the topic of restorative supervision The essence of training was to support leadership in the workplace Modules are all fixed at Level Masters requiring attendance one day per week and usually delivered over weeks Students are expected to participate in all the core lectures and the activities The PNA programme began during the Covid Pandemic for this reason most of the training during this period was delivered digitally via Microsoft Teams with enrolment and the content accessed via electronic portals We have heard for some PNAs accessing training proved problematic owing to unfamiliarity with such processes The delivery of training is gradually changing throughout the new waves of implementation and although most remains online the use of webinars development of small communities of practice and networking of PNAs who have completed training to support others across regions is now commonplace Interviewees described in depth getting to grips with their student needs and being responsive to feedback in some cases taking time to visit healthcare organisations to gain an understanding of the issues For some this resulted in making changes to the module as described I found that by listening to needs of the nurses we were able to actually free up some of the curriculum or some of the taught content to actually have a little bit more space in it to be a bit more creative which again for me was quite exciting really to be able to do that HEIP To date there is no parity regarding module content or assessment across the many HEIs delivering the programme This has created some frustrations and barriers to access for training amongst some PNAs Barriers to access relate to a lack of adequate entry credentials at the appropriate level to enable this study at level Previous experience gained in professional roles and CPD has sometimes negated academic entry problems but these are judged on a case by case basis This situation is best illustrated by the following observation A lot of us are unconvinced of the need for the module to be master s level it is coming from the academic nurses background but that feels the reality of the workforce nowadays Not everyone has this ability at this level but they do have the capabilities values experience and skills to be a PNA We have a very experienced older workforce It is putting people off and failure is counterproductive NHS The characteristics of Level modules and subsequent assessments are different in their delivery according to the HEI The content of the module must be quality assured and must deliver adequate academic work to be awarded accreditation Consequently we heard the academic credits awarded for the module ranged from to and the types of assessments to be completed varied It seemed that most issues described by participants reflected problems encountered by PNA trainees regarding being able to write at level and for some this translated as needing more support than was available to them Improved communications were also an identified need in some areas to help PNAs prepare for academic readiness to study and the academic processes required to become a student In some cases these issues remained challenging as described There are challenges with the courses I really don t know if this is the way to go for this qualification there is the academic side of this but the PNA role really lends itself to people who are compassionate are committed to wellbeing and these aspects don t always align and that s ok but putting this together in practice makes it a problem I had a fantastic nurse she already did clinical supervision but hadn t done any further education her name was put forward but she failed the assignment So it gives the wrong message that only the academic part matters NHS Shared learning from programmes was being facilitated through a network meeting and we understand some modifications were made from Wave to Wave for example Portfolio and poster presentation first time around Now it is a single essay but looking at whether this could be changed again to help the students It is words Level Masters HEI Nonetheless we heard on several occasions that there is a desire from some healthcare organisations to work closely with HEIs bring the course in house for example In the future we would like to co create the training so it is more appealing as work based learning we could then give staff the options and this would feel more inclusive to ensure nurses have equity of access NHS Regardless of the content and type of assessment we heard that HEIs were conscious about the academic workload required for the module and agreed that for some nurses new to learning at Level or in particularly challenging or busy clinical roles or with home life commitments this could pose a barrier to achievement Nevertheless the PNA role has been designated as a post graduate role requiring level study A number of the HEI participants explained the nature of additional learning support offered such as study skills Programme Evolution and Outputs Outputs described were reflective of the stage of implementation and were discussed by HEI leads and PNA leads in their corresponding roles as an iterative process of growth A general appreciation was reflected that the PNA programme has opened opportunities for nurses at any stage of their career to engage in further study and to combine this with experience Participants feel that the combination served to make nurses feel valued and empowered in their roles The narrative was presented that the PNA programme has created a movement in just months at point of evaluation with PNAs being trained and RCS interventions being delivered The benefits of roundtable meetings were highlighted in providing a forum to share practice that would otherwise not have been accessible from around the length and breadth of England We were told about outputs through the types of quality improvement QI projects underway and it was acknowledged that this type of activity could be hard to capture For the most part QI activities focused on delivering the restorative aspect of the PNA role One example of QI work was described as follows we only really get to know about these QI work from practice reflections as some submit Most are small scale things such as a way to change the way equipment is used to improve the safety perspective for staff NHS We asked participants about their understanding of RCS delivery outputs regarding the frequency and types of sessions offered Some participants described the workforce returns and counting activities but at the same time not being sure what counted as RCS This is illustrated from the remarks of one participant We are working on this we have moved from a position of nurses not wanting to take it RCS up because they felt guilty about taking the time when wards are so short staffed So we are still working on this we report the number of interventions but we also have career conversations informal conversations Also we are not sure what to count formal conversations impromptu conversations or booked in meetings We are gradually changing our approach based on what is described by the PNAs NHS Throughout the many accounts we heard there was an overwhelming sense of personal commitment and hard work to ensure a robust roll out of the PNA Programme while recognising opportunities to adjust to do things differently as needed along the way HEI and PNA leads have been developing supportive organisational structures and rewarding opportunities to improve positivity in the workplace Many great examples were shared and some of these are listed

data were collected from individuals with individual interviews and two person interviews Focus groups were not conducted due to scheduling difficulties and the lack of joint availability of participants Table shows the number of participants from each participant group Population Number of participants Regional PNA leads Trust PNA leads PNAs RCS Nurses HEI Institutes Table Number of participants interviewed from each population group Methods All interviews were conducted using Microsoft Teams and transcribed verbatim mean interview duration was minutes per interview standard deviation minutes They were transcribed using a service provided by Coventry University and anonymised Maximum variation sampling was used which ensured that all perspectives from all seven regions of the UK were included Individuals were recruited across the specialties identified by NHS England to include the criminal justice system primary care and the ambulance service Participants spanned a wide range of ages years males N and females N and those who completed PNA training via different course providers ranging from the first cohort to complete the course to the most recent cohort in total N different course providers Through familiarisation data were prepared and summaries made with a selection of transcripts member checked Data were organised and managed using a Framework Approach Ritchie et al informed by the evaluation objectives questions and theory Laschinger et al Data were retrieved and subsequently analysed from each framework category Ritchie et al throughout the five participants groups to reveal the range of themes and sub themes The Themes The interviews established the baseline provision of clinical supervision before the programme was introduced the delivery of the PNA programme with benefits and challenges and ideas which would help to sustain the programme Nurses described their experience of clinical supervision throughout their careers for some this was over years Individual experiences were influenced by the length of NHS service and the different clinical settings they had worked in For some their familiarity with supervision was personified through a traditional managerial model where clinical supervision continuing professional development and appraisal are interlinked Conversely for distinct groups of staff such as health visitors mental health nurses and children s nurses supervision was a regular occurrence normalised and integrated into their usual practice In contrast some nurses stated that supervision has never been a feature regardless of their length of nursing career or settings where they worked Baseline Provision of Clinical Supervision before the PNA Programme During the implementation of the PNA programme determining a baseline position amongst PNA trainees was an important starting point to understand their experience of participation in supervision Four sub themes are described here awareness experience and provision of clinical supervision potential benefits of good supervision perceived usefulness of existing supportive restorative services and time staffing and approaches used to deliver supervision Awareness Experience and Provision of Clinical Supervision In general prior to the PNA programme emerging supervision featured only marginally in nurses experience as illustrated below every presentation PNA Programme Implementation every meeting the question is asked how much clinical supervision have you had since you ve qualified And it s very little I ve got nurses that are probably in their s and s that never had clinical supervision It s not been valued and they never put it in place RPNAL Whilst educators were experienced in this field it was often remarked that the concept and delivery of supervision was new for many practising nurses I ve professionally been immersed in this whole area of practice clinical supervision really since well so way back when it probably feels new for many people so none of it s new for me because it s almost second nature and it s evolved so it evolved from what it was even within the statutory model to how it ended before statutory supervision demised HEIP It seemed that nurses exposure to clinical supervision was related to the specific characteristics of the clinical team and the commitment in various settings which drive the success for this to be embedded as part of practice So my experience of the clinical supervision goes back years and years because I ve got experience from district nursing And years ago clinical supervision the reflective model has always been predominantly embedded into district nursing and health visiting And so we used to run our own clinical supervision groups I was the lead for that within the trust at the time about rolling out a model and a policy erm accessibility for staff into that clinical supervision program sessions And then more recently with the transitioning to acute I d say about nine years ago acute had never heard of it So it became obvious it really was a community based reflective model that was known about a lot But in the acute they d never heard of it LPNA Where clinical supervision was delivered by management supervisors this was described as a tick box exercise Nurses did not feel like they could be truly honest with their superiors for fear of retribution This led to frustration nurses felt they were not able to get the most from their clinical supervision sessions and this led to the development of supervision stigma as remarked It was more about your bosses your hierarchy saying oh yes we ll look after you and your supervisee thinking yeah sure you will and being caged in and you didn t feel like you could open up and say how it really is you didn t feel like your job would be protected you thought oh they ll get rid of me I ll be sacked if I say too much about l if I speak up and call people out PNA Finally some PNAs and RCS Nurses reflected on the lack of clinical supervision throughout their careers I ve never had clinical supervision never been offered it never really spoken about it PNA The scope of experiences indicated demonstrates the contrasting provision and uptake of clinical supervision in nursing prior to the PNA programme The potential benefits of good clinical supervision Despite the varied experiences of clinical supervision nurses reflected a good understanding of the potential benefits of engaging in a process of support were it available to them Several nurses described coping without access to support and adopting undesirable strategies such as shelving or retaining problems which caused a range of psychological effects and career decisions One Lead PNA highlighted that a clear need for supervision existed even though nurses might not always be aware of their own needs in this area I think if people haven t had it they don t miss it because they don t know what they re missing But if I think back to people I ve worked with over the years I think there are people who have left who might have stayed if they d had access to clinical supervision I think I ve worked with people who have called off sick with stress related issues that probably could have stayed well with clinical supervision LPNA An extremely positive perspective of the potential of clinical supervision was exemplified by the following nurse I m a Mental Health Nurse since I have had supervision ever since I started nursing and I couldn t have done my job without supervision The foundations of clinical supervision started in psychiatry back in the old asylums So for me it s just been there it s one of those things I m a huge advocate of supervision I don t think anybody particularly clinical staff can be doing their job without supervision I think it s dangerous So my experience of supervision I ve had some amazing supervisors I ve had one or two that haven t been so amazing and it s just working with that really So I m a real advocate of clinical supervision LPNA Benefits in terms of workforce care quality staff well being staff development were described by the HEI Leads relating to education and development I mean there s huge variance regarding benefits but I m thinking of a couple of students in particular coming to my mind and their words are I was able to stay it s refreshed my career I m now using all my skills that I ve had over the whole of my career and I m reenergised It s almost what s happening with some of our legacy nursing and legacy midwives in terms of keeping people that end of career bit but this doesn t necessarily mean end of as in thirty years down the line it s retaining people in a different way HEIP The poignant example below illustrates how supervision at critical moments in a nurse s career could have significant impact in recovering and learning from mistakes in practice I remember after making my first drug error not wanting to give anyone any medications ever again and actually having someone to talk that through with rather than just working you know you speak it through with your friends but I think in situations like that clinical supervision would have helped me to process it quicker and hopefully then it wouldn t have affected me for as long as it did PNA The potential benefits of resolving anxieties through restorative clinical supervision were also reflected upon I think if I had chance to develop and understand what my anxiety was about I probably would have stayed within the clinical role more than going into the educational role PNA These examples from practice reflect different experiences that positively or negatively influenced nurses wellbeing and ultimately sometimes the choices made throughout their careers It was evident that many nurses felt that restorative clinical supervision has a role to play in supporting nurses to practice effectively Perceived Value of Supportive Restorative Services Prior to the national launch of the PNA programme it seems the availability of clinical supervision was not widespread and if available uptake was poor Nurses discussed a range of supportive restorative services that were available to them e g access to a clinical psychologist access to human resources staff and chaplaincy Nevertheless for some these services were perceived as inappropriate the key reason being the lack of relatedness and shared experience of being a nurse and thereby understanding problems from a nursing perspective as illustrated The only service that was available for us to go and talk to is this clinical psychologist for half an hour whilst on shift And it was just not I can t go and spill my beans and put my beans all back in a box RCS the hospital we do have psychologists we do have chaplains and we do have I prefer the other one it s the support for other staff as well wellbeing hub So we do have that kind of stuff but I don t know I haven t utilised that very much I feel more comfortable with the PNA it s just because she is a nurse as well I m a nurse she can understand me RCS I think there is definitely something around that shared experience and that understanding So for example a nurse to a nurse well I ve walked in your shoes you know PNA Hence it would seem there has been a gap in support deemed to be appropriate prior to the introduction of the PNA programme for many nurses who preferred peer to peer support from other nurse colleagues Time staffing and approach used to deliver Clinical Supervision Many participants suggested the main reason that clinical supervision has not been a prominent feature within nursing has been lack of time to deliver due to insufficient staffing in clinical settings The way in which clinical supervision was delivered impacted on the spread of provision and equity of access throughout nursing Regional PNA Leads identified that whilst supervision in nursing has overall been scarce it was more embedded for some groups of staff by comparison to others For example mental health nursing was identified as more likely to have embedded clinical supervision Lead PNAs reflected on one of the biggest challenges in the implementation of the PNA programme related to the time commitment needed Time accessibility is a major barrier Having time to be relieved And how does that look These people still have a job So you ve got nurses in intensive care who might be Sisters They can t leave and provide an hour Or you ve got staff working in casualty so it s very difficult for staff unless they ve been given that protected time to deliver But also the accessing of it again is down to how good the managers are So if we ve got managers who are supportive of staff to access it It might be a case of them accessing in their own time If they do it s still very unsure are they getting that time back So that could be a barrier because you might be thinking why should I when I ve got a busy life anyway And how much sessional time are you gonna support Is it gonna be an hour a week An hour a month What does that look like Some places are looking at hours a month but then other places might go I really cannot relieve a PNA for hours a month from existing duties that they have to do they ve employed them to do because actually I ve got vacancy rate I ve got sickness rate I can t get bank or agency LPNA Depending on the approach used may have meant clinical supervision was subsumed within post graduate programmes rather than being part of everyday nursing practice So from my experience working with an acute provider the majority of nurses that got supervision were predominantly speciality nurses So things like clinical nurse specialists midwifery they were very much ring fenced identified for clinical supervision When it came down to the general nursing registered nursing it was very it was very ad hoc I think one of the reasons is the time factor The other reason is that I think a lot of them badge add this on to other programmes like the preceptorship programme or one to ones Whereas the restorative clinical supervision programme is so much more than that RPNA L Many nurses described the contrasting delivery of clinical supervision across different areas of the nursing workforce Yeah with me it wasn t a thing when I was working in ITU I knew about it because I d got friends that worked in mental health and learning disability nursing and it was a real big thing with them PNA A number of nurses identified the need to roster in advanced to allow space for clinical restorative supervision It was noted that this was a challenging aspiration in the context of short staffing I think it s organisational I think generally we can see that the NHS whichever hospital you walk in no where s adequately staffed I mean in my Trust they did try about ten to fifteen years ago actually they did train ward managers went to local universities and did training for supervision but when they tried to put that into practice there wasn t the time to pull people off to sit and talk to them for an hour it never got done PNA Nursing has always been so busy and most nurses always put their patient first and there s always something else to do Nursing has never been very good at giving nurses any time out of the clinical work phase PNA Delivering the PNA Programme At each level of the PNA programme implementation distinctive challenges were described The biggest cross cutting themes related to the organisation and administration of the programme Challenges were broadly expressed by Regional PNAs in relation to the recruitment of PNAs Lead PNAs described the speed of recruitment required course content and variations of this across England PNAs themselves described a mixed response to their training and the realities of implementation in practice RCS Nurses described frustrations with the difficulty being released from practice for clinical supervision Three broad themes emerged as Challenges to Overall Programme Delivery Benefits of Restorative Clinical Supervision and Challenges related to the Delivery of Supervision in Practice Challenges to Overall Programme Delivery This data related to the Regional PNA and Site Leads with several accounts given regarding issues relating to recruitment and retention of PNAs to the PNA programme In the following quote the Regional PNA Lead explains that PNA course recruitment and retention issues occur due to the lack of time for Healthcare Trusts to release staff for the course So administratively it s been quite a pickle because it s such a short time frame to ask for nurses to be released that we were we ve been scrambling sometimes to get enough to fill cohorts at the right time Then you ll manage to fill them but you ll then confirm places with people then you ll get people pulling out because they just can t get release So whether that s more support needed in trust for them to be released when they re given a place Whether we need to be more forceful with no this is your place you need to take it and you need to work out how you do that I don t know but that that can be frustrating RPNAL P Some of the Lead PNAs and PNAs described a lack of standardisation in the delivery of the PNA programme assessments across the different HEIs and the issues this created for them My experience was such a differential in each provider So you might get some universities wanting credits some were wanting credits some were doing credits and you didn t have a choice It was a case of you got sent to the university and it might be credits for you It might be credits for you And I don t think that really was thought through because then you had some staff who didn t want to credits and do a word essay as well as everything else and then you had to staff who do want to do credits So that caused a bit of mayhem a bit of extra stress I am getting different feedback from different universities well from different people attending different universities because I don t think it s standardised enough LPNA I think it the assessment should be standardised because it causes trouble it causes frustrations especially those that have the more in depth assessments PNA It appears that the rush to recruit nurses contributed to some managers nominating their staff rather than staff voluntarily completing the programme This meant that some nurses and managers were unprepared and did not know what to expect I don t think with hindsight my manager really knew what the role was So I don t think there was much awareness of actually what I was signing myself up to PNA While others nurses described the lack of time to apply and prepare themselves for the course We had ten minutes to get our applications forms in We had no idea what we were letting ourselves in for because at that point there really wasn t any information about it and I didn t know about the PMA role at that point either So no I knew absolutely nothing other than my matron saying to me I volunteered you to do this course I was like oh okay then You ve got ten minutes to get your application form in The course starts in a couple of days and I don t know what s involved in it I was like oh okay PNA These are important issues to be resolved for each partner in the process of the PNA Programme delivery In particular the timing of the recruitment for the prospective PNAs requires adequate readiness to study such as arranging the commitment of time prior reading and as described getting in the zone These are regarded as key success factors for post graduate study Benefits of Restorative Clinical Supervision Across the participant groups many benefits were described regarding the difference that restorative clinical supervision has made or has the potential to make Each group gave examples based on their level of involvement with the PNA programme The RCS group as key benefactors in this model stressed many benefits and outcomes of the PNA model In delivering RCS whether through the ideal model of delivery or the adapted brief model of delivery the Regional PNA Leads emphasised that the PNA programme is about offering support to professionals not solutions It s giving people the opportunity to reflect and as a PMA or a PNA you re not there to provide the solution you re there to listen and let that person find the in many ways direct them well not direct them but get them to come to some sort of solution some sort of action plan RPNAL We learnt about the need to report restorative clinical supervision delivery via workforce returns we understood from this that there is some confusion regarding what constitutes restorative clinical supervision and whether to count short bursts of contact as illustrated I think people just need to recognise that a corridor conversation can be a contact You know if you ve had that minutes for somebody who s really distressed and you ve made a difference then you need to be able to count it but nurses don t They think it s you got to sit down you got to be away in privacy from the clinical area But it s about recognising that it RCS comes in different forms really Some of it people are doing walk around the wards You know so they re taking trolley and they re going around and they re talking about the role and people come up and have a chat to them And some of those conversations might be a bit more in depth than others RPNAL Flexibility of approaches used for supervision according to circumstance was echoed by a nurse who had received RCS I think there are some sessions that need to be away from everybody else where that person can whether they need to absolutely break down and just lose it and then put that armour back on again It depends on the situation But I think you definitely could do a part of your morning huddle with the team so what s going on with your patients today It can be brought in like that RCS PNAs described numerous benefits associated with the PNA model but were clear that nurses who were not directly involved with the programme were aware of them Some nurses identified that effective and timely supervision had retained them in nursing and had enabled them to overcome significant workplace related wellbeing problems Having some restorative supervision from a really excellent supervisor really helped me remain in work and be effective in my job Actually it did give me the insight and confidence to think I m ready to move on and that s how I ended up moving on and coming into this role really I think that supervision I had at that point was quite a pivotal thing for me PNA We interviewed PNAs through this we learnt of many other benefits regarding their role in delivering restorative clinical supervision these are summarised in Figure Figure Summary of the benefits of RCS delivery identified by PNAs Benefits of RCS identified by PNAs Improvement in personal self care Improved work life balance Increased enjoyment at work Improved mental health and well being Enhanced life satisfaction Improved home life well being Improved personal and professional development Improved relationships and teamwork whilst at work Enhance NHS s image due to healthier and happier workforce Enhanced resilience A larger number of effective service improvements Improved retention of staff Improvements in nurse empowerment Improved confidence of staff Better job satisfaction Smoother transition for overseas staff coming to the UK Improved delivery of patient care Improved physical and mental health of nurses lower sickness levels Personal and professional benefits to the PNAs conducting RCS Almost all RCS nurses interviewed presented their experience of RCS positively emphasising the restorative element by PNAs and the importance of this to supporting them in practice I think sometimes we just need that somebody who won t be judging us like somebody is just there to listen to us Somebody who will just accept what we re feeling rather than saying you do this you do this and you do this It s just a way for you to open up yourselves without being judged RCS It allows you an opportunity to talk about the challenges that you deal with and in fact you start to work things out for yourself but that only happens when you express those thoughts And also sometimes there are shared feelings that you don t realise that perhaps people do experience as well So I think that s really useful And just simply a little bit of time out from the usual hustle and bustle is beneficial RCS The responsiveness and understanding from individual PNAs tasked with the delivery of the model and following up nurse s post supervision to develop a supportive relationship rather than supervision being viewed as a one off event was also exemplified Yeah there s been follows ups and it s been very very informal It s mainly been when we ve been both been stood in the Nero queue for our coffee and it s like are you alright how are things do you want to chat I m just upstairs And I have popped up to see her and I ve borrowed the odd book off her and things So it s been very very informal I know that I felt if I needed a formal session I could email her and say can we have so and so please and it would be sorted straightaway RCS Many other key benefits outcomes of the PNA model were voiced by the RCS nurses Notably many of these align with Laschinger s model of empowerment particularly psychological empowerment and the development of positive work feelings Figure Figure The benefits of the PNA model identified by RCS Nurses Increased retention Reduced Feeling valued stress Benefits and outcomes of the PNA Improved Decreasd model patient burnout care Increased Job morale and satisfaction enjoyment Strategies used during supervision by RCS nurses were also identified which have the potential to strengthen its benefits or outcomes in the future as listed Having the opportunity to talk through challenges and shared feelings rather than shelving or retraining them Learning how to work things through for oneself solutions Learning how to express thoughts and feelings gaining trust and insight Taking some time out from work during periods of high stress Validation of how someone is feeling Learning how to deal with difficult situations more effectively insight experience Ensuring that work issues are not carried outside of work containment Challenges to the delivery of restorative clinical supervision in practice Challenges relating to a lack of hands on practical experience to deliver RCS were identified by PNAs as problematic This was recognised by Lead PNAs and feedback to HEI Leads who worked hard to remedy issues raised Lead PNAs and PNAs were concerned that the content and delivery of PNA module does not always fully prepare them to deliver RCS nobody s ever observed me and said Yes that s how you do it or No it isn t You re just left to get on with it and that to me is the biggest failing of the university course PNA Similarly some PNAs felt the course was too theory based and the online delivery only option available during Covid period prohibited the practical application of delivering the role after the course as described by this participant What now What happens now How do I do restorative clinical supervision And I think that s what we re seeing with some of our PNA s coming out from university Well I haven t even done restorative clinical supervision so I don t really know what I need I don t really know how to do it PNA A Lead PNA described how the Hospital tried to mitigate this challenge by offering in house training opportunities to prepare their nurses to deliver RCS during and after the PNA programme Just attending a piece of training does not make you competent at delivering restorative clinical supervision But then we also build in access to RCS for about sessions at least with a supervisor So there s role modelling there s that emotional experience of what it feels like The appreciation of each other s roles and contribution listening to how the supervisor questions and responds And then we also give them the opportunity of doing a practice run with someone else or one of us And so they re actually building up skills real life skills rather than just following and watching a video LPNA We also heard extremely positive accounts from HEI providers where modules had been modified to reflect PNA feedback for example the introduction of role play recorded to practice RCS with peer group feedback and aspects which aided the communication skills needed in practice as described I realised because at first it was a written reflection and a competency document and there was a very high failure rate because of the lack of academic skills of the cohort the first cohort that I ran So I took my thoughts and ideas to the Major Modifications Board at the university and said that because of the nature of the role being so hugely dependent on communication skills hugely dependent on presentation skills that a written assignment didn t align with the overall role So I asked and proposed that we changed it to a presentation an individual presentation alongside the competency document and had to do loads of work to amend that The value of that was very evident because there was a tremendous increase in pass rates because those nurses were much more proficient at communication skills HEIP Nearly all PNAs identified a lack of time to conduct RCS as a significant issue impeding the roll out of the programme While some PNAs indicated they had protected time most did not and they felt they were not able to fulfil the role to their satisfaction Essentially even with protected time some PNAs still were pulled back into clinical practice It seemed that lower band nurses found it more difficult to get the free time to conduct PNA related activities Some nurses found their own solutions and delivered RCS in their own time although this was considered unfair and some Trusts have even prohibited this I don t have the allocated time and I am not able to release staff for protected time paid time to do it So I haven t been able to run these sort of proper restorative clinical supervision sessions PNA Nurses were concerned that the speed of introducing the programme could adversely affect its longer term sustainability I just know that sometimes the NHS can be very quick to put a plaster on a hole rather than taking the time to actually properly fix it I m worried that this is going to turn into a quick fix solution that s going to end up going down the drain and not working because they haven t put the right time and resources into it and it s just been rushed through That s my biggest concern really PNA Nurses reflected that altruistic behaviour could make it hard for some nurses to prioritise restorative supervision for themselves and for others as illustrated by this example I d say that actually some of the people that I manage might say it s difficult to get the time out to do this but I think that s a more of a organisational cultural thing and something that we d have to work on to make people nurses realise that it s important that they have make time to do things like this RCS Despite the obvious tensions in delivering restorative clinical supervision the underlying motivations of the PNAs were embodied through making a difference Even if I don t know I only speak to five people a week or five people a month even and I make a difference then that was worth it I don t have to speak to people Last month I only spoke to one person but they then haven t now left the profession I consider that a win PNA In this situation it is not about the volume of RCS delivered but the impact of delivery Whilst having adequate time to deliver RCS was a predominant challenge nurses also identified stigma associated with receiving RCS Some nurses felt that visiting a PNA for RCS could indicate something negative to others e g poor mental health or a negative incident that has occurred as illustrated by the following examples There s a little bit of stigma when somebody is going for that RCS because people think that they re not mentally stable they re emotionally not stable And there is still that stigma that they re not okay that s why they need to go to RCS RCS I always thought clinical supervision was what happens when you re kind of being performance managed or reviewed So it when I first heard about it I was like oh my God what have I done wrong RCS Although the perception of available time and staffing resources were prominent barriers to the delivery of clinical restorative supervision other important barriers voiced by the RCS nurses as illustrated in Figure Figure Challenges described by the RCS nurses regarding receiving RCS Awareness of the role just get on No physical with it space to do culture RCS PNA and RCS barriers Not wanting Prior relationship manager to with available know PNAs Unsure of confidentality Despite some difficulties in delivering and receiving RCS a willingness to overcome problems and find solutions was evident throughout the interviews Future Sustainability of the Programme All staff engaged in the programme believed it was a positive enterprise to benefit nurses Key aspects discussed were sharing experiences to learn from each other building and maintaining relationships the organisational structures required for successful delivery adapting the programme delivery and continued funding were seen to be crucial to sustain the programme The Regional PNA Leads discussed the importance of building and maintaining relationships across the range of key players involved in the implementation of the PNA programme the national team lead PNAs PNAs and the HEIs For example the Regional PNA below reflected on the important ways they worked with and supported each other and how their role drives the programme forward we re all on the positive side we all get on really well We meet when we can every week we work in a collaborative way We try we don t try and do something completely different so I think there s a lot of cohesion We re always willing to help each other and support For example I ve not been able to fill this cohort and I m like well I ve got so many on the waiting list can they come on yours Can they come in your numbers you know not to underestimate the role of the regional PNA leads both in driving it forward there have been sometimes where you know you got those operational pressures and it s really tough going but it s to keep that sort of momentum and positivity going And that is so now that it s become a movement Regional PNA Leads felt their role should continue to feature in the infrastructure of the programme in the future to aid the national oversight I do think you need a regional role Even if it s just at one day a week or two days a week I can t see it working otherwise I know that they want they re taking about local leadership Yes local leadership is fine but someone s going to have to inspire them and get them to agree to filling up places and then looking after their colleagues Otherwise they re going to be having I don t know how many trusts there are in the country and something trusts contacting the national team but the programme needs some sort of regional based leadership just to help coordinate it and keep it together whilst there are funded places So there s only one more year after that maybe things will be embedded enough that it can sustain itself and the national team can bring it together RPNALINT If regional roles are to be successfully reduced in line with the long term national plan it was suggested that Lead PNAs should be available at every Trust This was seen as an important role in its own right but it was noted that competing priorities often reduced the capacity to organise and manage the delivery of the programme So hopefully my vision in two years every provider will have a dedicated PNA lead That s might not be full time might only be two or three days a week So then actually that person who s got the capacity to push the programme forward within the organisation So that s my vision they ve all got a PNA lead but again it depends like me I ve got I m doing PNA I m doing lots of different roles isn t it So then they re not all dedicated they re not all dedicated to the PNA they re probably juggling the corporate responsibilities RPNALINT It was identified that the delivery of the programme is generating the potential for research with questions contemplated regarding the effectiveness of current delivery in practice settings It s a reality versus the theory And in time to come they ll probably start writing up more research about that actual transition of theory into reality because I think yes we ve got lots of research data about an hour and we book them in and we follow them up and things like that and that s really good But what about the minutes What difference does that make And so that data collection you know and we re having discussions now we re like how do we collect that data How do we make it easy so we can collect it and it doesn t get forget forgotten how can we actually go back to the people that accessed it and ask them did it make a difference But actually did it also make a little bit more difference to how you can face your day your resilience refreshing resetting you you know So there s a lot of I think work around that LPNA The HEI Leads offered their perspectives regarding the oversight needed to support and sustain the education of PNAs in practice settings in this case evolving the programme in line with challenges in healthcare I will always every cohort look to improving the module as much as I can improving the content updating things making sure it s contemporary and it reflects contemporary healthcare needs HEIP And in this case one provider reflected about the styles of delivery and how this might need to change to adequately prepare PNAs for their roles I think we could do more restorative clinical supervision activities where it is one to one and where we can potentially film and feedback and then debrief so a little bit like that so they felt a bit more confident to go out and hit the ground running as I m not so sure they do at the moment HEIP There was a suggestion of clinical supervision being a mandatory part of every healthcare professional s role Every nurse and midwife healthcare professional physiotherapist occupational therapists paramedic must have restorative clinical supervision or they must have PNA or PMA or whatever that would make a huge amount of difference That would make it real HEIP The influence that the programme is already having was also reflected upon positively with the caveat that this will need to be adequately funded I hope it continues to get the level of funding to support it I think even if it didn t I think there s an appetite now and that s quite exciting I think as I said there s people that can see their career trajectory going in another way because of it which is something they d not thought of really HEIP And finally the ultimate benefits of the programme for the future workforce were encapsulated by this description This workforce will come out knowing that the professional advocates are there as part of a support network and will utilise them as part of their everyday working life which is what we want because then we want them to be more resilient and that s what we aim to do So hopefully that s what will happen HEIP PNAs frequently discussed the need to learn from PMAs as well as other PNAs commenting that the role should not be carried out in isolation Some respondents felt the role should not be exclusive to nursing consequently it was believed that the PNA model had the potential to be implemented across other professions Engaging all professionals all healthcare professionals within the MDT I don t think there s one PNA that I know feels like this is exclusive to nursing It started in midwifery and it was deemed not exclusive to midwifery it s now in nursing as well and I think midwives and nurses see that this is something to be launched across healthcare generally PNA It was also viewed as having the potential to create greater multidisciplinary relationships You could have a nurse to a paramedic for example and then you would have shared learning and respect for each other s roles as well as understanding which is what we wanted to develop that relationship amongst our workforce as well So that s why we made it multidisciplinary PNA The value of the PNA role in relation to newly recruited international nurses was mentioned It was recognised as a transition that could be stressful and where RCS might help support individuals It will be beneficial for the overseas nurses when they come here for example they re newly hired into the hospital it would be a good time for them to have RCS when they arrive to prepare themselves emotionally and physically because they re overseas nurses and they can feel that somebody can support them emotionally especially when you re in a foreign country and you don t have family members like anxiety and depression can easily strike them RCS The RPNALs emphasised the importance of the programme and reinforced that the future direction is around nurturing and embedding the programme within the trusts I think it s an absolutely brilliant project It s something that we needed It s something we ve got to embed and we ve got sustain RPNALINT CONCLUSION The three aspects of Laschinger s model of empowerment namely Structural empowerment Psychological empowerment and Positive work feelings are represented throughout the evaluation data The aspects of the model are never cited in isolation and are interconnected perspectives Hence making positive changes to improve the PNA Programme is complex and an appreciation of the connections between National Regional and Site Levels is required Structural Empowerment At NHS England programme level the establishment of the PNA programme and its gradual roll out through the regions of England has been achieved through a centralised well organised approach via the PNA office We heard that regional leads were supporting their site leads but that further backing was needed from some Directors of Nursing to deliver the programme For example wide disparity of approaches was described with some site lead PNAs juggling many other priorities limiting the time to invest in implementation of the PNA programme Nevertheless sharing of good practice examples through the regional networks was successful and brought cohesiveness to its delivery HEI Leads worked very closely with partners across all levels and demonstrated flexibility to modify the education modules following feedback Their role to support PNAs at the clinical interface was also described positively At the clinical interface recruiting nurses to the PNA programme is gradually being achieved but the speed of recruitment and last minute reaction to fill available places may not achieve a consistent approach and good organisational spread of PNAs Structural empowerment is reflected through opportunities created to undertake the PNA training and role and for RCS nurses to uptake the process At this level of delivery the predominant resources called for are adequate time and a safe space to participate Information to support implementation and to generate interest and support for the model is featured through good examples of collective supportive local networks Not everyone involved however in the PNA programme is well connected with some PNAs feeling isolated in their roles Informal power for some is enabled through the ability to lead the PNA work and or RCS sessions and is expressed by the relationships with each other For example the building of trust in the RCS relationship is critical to development of informal power Formal power seems to be dependent on the position the respondent holds for example the perception is that more senior nurses site leads hold the positional power to support or not adequately support the implementation of the model The relationships here between the site leads and the PNAs are critical to the successful delivery of RCS Consequently the success of the programme at site level requires meaningful commitment of people involved Psychological Empowerment Given at the time of reporting many nurses had only received one or two sessions of RCS the psychological impact of the PNA role was mostly articulated as a short term benefit which helped nurses receiving RCS to feel better The time out for RCS provided release and on return to the clinical areas RCS nurses felt more enabled to self manage and cope in stressful intense workplace situations Psychological empowerment is realised from a sense of individual personal control and a critical awareness of the environmental challenges This will require transition and commitment moving away from an individual perspective of benefit toward relationships with PNAs to enable engagement in workplace activities This process is perhaps currently at an early stage with nurse engagement in RCS necessitating individual transition through several stages An early appreciation of this transition was described by the nurses where their experiences of RCS at the outset was dependent on trust building to take this beyond an experience towards sharing scenarios where they could visualise and use support It seems for those who were able to plan future sessions and these were limited instances they felt invested and were more committed to the collaboration needed And finally there was realisation that RCS could help the enactment of change s in the workplace as illustrated in Figure Figure Transition and experience of nurses in Restorative Clinical Supervision Experience of Nurses in the Restorative Clinical Supervision Process T ENACTING R U C

N G Stage Stage Stage Independence Interdependence Dependence Resolution Restoration Release It is evident throughout that RCS enables release of emotions and through sharing and collaboration provides degrees of restoration Positive Work Feelings RCS is a positive experience it is welcomed and looked forward to by Nurses who have experienced the process The immediate outcome of RCS was to feel relieved of an issue and to see a way forward which was always related in a positive scenario RCS Nurses did express commitment to the A EQUIP model in the workplace RCS nurses did not relate the RCS process with job satisfaction but were beginning to express feeling valued in their roles and indicated having less inclination to leave the profession Some PNAs felt their skills to manage staff situations had been improved with reductions observed in overall nurse sickness rates in some areas It is however too early to comment on whether RCS results in lower levels of staff burnout The prerequisite conditions must be considered and well thought out during implementation to include time for RCS and for PNAs to carry out the role private space to conduct the RCS sessions and good communication regarding the plans to involve the key people Revisiting the theoretical model Commitment to the PNA Programme was the consistent contingent feature throughout this evaluation frequently expressed as being able to commit through adequate time The implementation of RCS through PNAs requires the unyielding commitment from staff who are delivering the programme and must not be contingent on having ideal workforce conditions e g to release staff It is asserted that over time this model will become thoroughly embedded in nursing practice and increased engagement in quality improvement activities to improve patient care and workforce wellbeing will emerge Hence commitment has been added as a necessary agent of change to the Structural and Psychological constructs of Laschinger s model to support the pre existing aspect of commitment which featured in positive work feelings Figure Figure Revisiting Laschinger s Model of Empowerment Structural Empowerment Psychological

Recognising Space empathy stressors Information Autonomy Trust Feeling valued Ownership of problems Better team Support Commitment Low burnout culture Self control A EQUIP realised Resources Impact Prepared to engage in Features activities Listening Formal power Coaching Supporting Informal Participating power Exploring Encouraging Christens model This model provided additional insights based on relational aspects of the A EQUIP model Progressing from the level of simply completing the PNA training or attending RCS sessions requires an appreciation of what participation can bring to PNAs and RCS nurses and the organisations We heard that it could bridge divisions in different areas of practice through developing PNA communities For RCS nurses it can increase the understanding of latent issues which sometimes exist beneath the surface in the workplace So it seems that relational empowerment is inextricably linked to a trust building process which is ultimately critical to the uptake of RCS from PNAs This is described by Christens as transformative empowerment achieved predominantly through the relationships with others in the programme and the benefits this can bring Revisiting our assumptions from the Logic Model Programme Theory At the outset assumptions relating to the implementation of the PNA Programme were made at the policy financial and organisational level Figure Figure Original assumptions made regarding the PNA Programme Ass umptions political financial organisational spanning inputs activities outputs and out comes P NHSE finance is stable and secure for PNA Programme Implementation P PMA Midwife Programme is suitable and can be applied to a workforce of Nurses P The concept of the PNA Programme is adequate to engage early support from partners HEIs and NHS P Changes to the PNA programme are an incentive to engage further stakeholders P NHS Trusts can recruit sufficient nurses to become PNAs P The mechanisms for delivery of the restorative clinical supervision model are adequately iden tified and understood by stakeholders These assumptions were based on our early understanding of the mechanisms in place to achieve the inputs activities and outputs of the programme In revisiting these as show below we have allowed the data to determine the challenges and changes to our assumptions evident following our evaluation Figure Revisiting the original assumptions made regarding the PNA Programme Ass umptions political financial organisational spanning inputs activities outputs and out comes P The level of NHSE finance is being reviewed and revisited for PNA Programme implementation with strategic changes being recommended P PMA Midwife Programme presents a suitable model for the large workforce of Nurses P The PNA Programme is learning from first and second wave implementers to further engage early support from partners HEIs and NHS P Changes to the PNA programme are an incentive to engage further stakeholders P NHS Trusts can recruit sufficient nurses to become PNAs through a more planned cohesive workforce approach to reach PNAs to Nurses P Local structures and reciprocal relationships need to develop to support PNA Programme P The mechanisms for delivery of the restorative clinical supervision model require further dissemination to ensure greater understanding across the workforce P Outcomes of the programme will evolve and mature to be quantifiable in the next months RECOMMENDATIONS An Embedded Approach Key to the ongoing success of the PNA programme relates to structural support to ensure the ongoing embedding of RCS into nursing practice To ensure that the restorative clinical supervision and PNA model is sustained it must be prioritised alongside patient care integrated into practice and normalised It is important that RCS is not viewed as something that is event driven and delivered at the point of a crisis but instead a core element of nursing practice which may prevent such events crises from occurring Education about RCS The PNA model is currently not well understood by the profession and individual nurses and is perceived as a very formal service that is used to deal with negative events It is important that the narrative transitions from a formalized event driven service to a normalized service that is used for positive events Education is needed about the PNA model what it is how to access it and what the benefits are Reducing Stigma It is critical to reduce the stigma associated with supervision and stigma associated with poor mental health Negative connotations will inhibit update of RCS and prevent nurses from engaging in positive help seeking practices When nurses lack access to support they are more likely to adopt coping strategies that may be ineffective and harmful Well supported nurses are more likely to stay in the profession Identifying and Supporting PNA s in Training It is important that sufficient time and thought is given to selecting nurses for the PNA training programme Nurses need time to reflect on their decision to apply Potential candidates need adequate information about the PNA role and what the course is comprised of Given that individual nurses will have a preference regarding teaching style and preferred assessment method candidates would ideally have some choice Standardising the Assessment Process HEIs involved in the delivery of the training module should work together towards standardising the best elements of the assessment process Nurses are participating in post graduate work based learning and learning outcomes should focus on what is needed to enable application in practice Currently nurses who have completed the programme network with others and hear of disparity regarding the final module assessment This is dispiriting and reduces engagement in the process Support in Practice for PNAs To ensure sustainability of the PNA model it is important that each Trust has an appropriate Lead PNA The Lead PNA needs adequate protected time to drive the implementation of the role manage and support PNA recruitment and training and monitor implementation and impact at an organisational level Trusts should continue to work together to share best practice and resources Due to the difficult topics that may be discussed during RCS it is also important that PNAs themselves receive RCS and support Time to Deliver RCS PNAs need time in practice to deliver RCS a quiet and safe space to hold RCS sessions Without these ingredients the benefits of the PNA programme will not be fully realised Future Research There is much more that needs to be understood regarding the how RCS is developed and how nurses are empowered through RCS It is understood that each element of Laschinger s model are enablers to delivery of the PNA programme and that relational aspects with developing communities of PNAs are important connections throughout but it is not understood how RCS is delivered at an individual level and whether a progressive RCS model would help track and support individual a trajectory of growth LIMITATIONS This evaluation took place at pace Contracting funding and recruitment to study team was finalised in May and study permission during August The study team worked hard to minimise any limitations encountered Rapid Review of Literature A protocol guiding the review was established which focused on empowerment and nurses from the PNA programme The primary limitation was the focus on nurses given that much of the literature April was generated by the Midwife programme The second limitation arose from the quality of literature with a dearth of studies containing data regarding empowerment This demonstrates that further research regarding empowerment from restorative clinical supervision is warranted Case Studies stage one of the case studies involved short survey Those returned were incomplete in all cases It is unclear why information was not completed but possibilities include not having the information to hand not having time to locate the information needed and not having access to the information at the time of completing the part one survey This was mostly remedied during interviews where information was requested and often provided or sent after the interview The original ambition was to invite HEI leads and Trust PNA Leads to joint interviews but the logistics of this proved impossible to negotiate Nevertheless our understanding of HEIs and NHS sites to whom they are aligned revealed that our original envisaged colocations for both was incorrect e g HEIs were recruiting PNA trainees from across many sites not always collocated Regional Site Lead and PNA interviews these were conducted as planned in accordance with the maximum variation strategy The study team members MK AC and NB worked together to recruit all participants and interviews were conducted over days of the week accommodating hours to suit Some interviews were cancelled at short notice by participants and were rescheduled where possible Despite tenacious attempts to arrange a convenient time one participant missed the end of study deadline for data collection Nurses Receiving Restorative Supervision RCS numerous and consistent attempts were made from August to November to recruit this group of participants who proved extremely difficult to reach via the agreed mechanisms via NHSE The initial study communication was distributed via NHSE where responses were received from all groups of PNAs with no responses from RCS Nurses A poster was also distributed shortly afterwards via NHSE A study database was commenced and updated by MK In a follow up to this NHSE were asked to contact Site Leads and PNAs who in turn were asked to contact this group by email We have learnt that clinical nurses are not able to regularly access their emails while on duty negating responses During September advice was sought from NHSE regarding recruitment strategies This was followed by a Risks and Mitigation Paper discussed with NHSE in October Appendix pages Further information was distributed to NHSE to remind PNAs of the importance of this group of participants including a poster At PNA interviews participants were asked if they would pass on the study information to RCS Nurses for their consideration The survey was adapted to include participant email address if they were prepared to participate in an interview This yielded several from the RCS Nurse group Three Twitter Appeals were made via NHSE and the study PI The principal investigator gave a talk about the PNA Evaluation at a national PNA webinar hosted by NHSE this yielded many more PNAs but not nurses receiving restorative supervision from PNAs Some PNA leads felt uncomfortable forwarding requests to participate RCS nurses APPENDICES Appendix Certificate of Approval to Conduct Study Page Appendix The Rapid Review

so that we can reflect on our process what worked and what was more difficult and compare our reviews to determine more consistent review process conducted before we conduct the full review and again at stages during the review process to ensure we are remaining consistent and robust which may achieve the IRR in the process Good practice also stems from the volume of people involved in the process

designed to evaluate aspects of the Professional Nurse Advocate PNA programme which delivers training and restorative supervision for nurses right across England The programme launched in March towards the end of the third wave of COVID This was the start of a critical point of recovery for patients for services and for our workforce PNA training provides those on the programme with skills to facilitate restorative supervision to their colleagues and teams in nursing and beyond A version of this programme exists already for maternity colleagues where outcomes point to improved staff wellbeing and retention alongside improved patient outcomes The training equips them to listen and to understand challenges and demands of fellow colleagues and to lead support and deliver quality improvement initiatives in response This brief survey has been developed as part of an independent evaluation of the PNA programme commissioned by NHS England and NHS Improvement The evaluation is being conducted by a team from Coventry University PARTICIPANT INFORMATION STATEMENT The purpose of this research is to evaluate using an online survey the Professional Nurse Advocate PNA programme and understand its impact on nurses within the National Health Service NHS Your voice experiences and perspectives are important within this evaluation because it will help us to understand the PNA

completing this survey Appendix Case Studies data collection guide pages Case Studies A case study comprises one NHS organization acute trust community mental health trust etc the nearest and majority University HEI provider and the Lead PNAs Aim To evaluate the PNA model understand the importance of context in determining the extent to which the programme assumptions contribute to expected changes as per tender Objectives for the case studies To gather descriptive contextual data related to the PNA programme by conducting a deep dive across the landscape and partnerships To provide a collective overview and understanding of how well the PNA programme is working at an organisational level To draw out how partners work with each other how current practices have been created altered or refined to accommodate the PNA role Selection of Case Studies organisations of healthcare and education Purposive selection to include Health and education organisations from each of the NHSE regions to ensure maximum representation across all areas NB HEIs do not link exactly to regions as most have trained PNAs in multiple organisations from across England Methods Case Studies will be conducted in two parts We propose to email a data extraction document to selected individual sites via NHSE to enable sites to collate and prepare their quantitative data which contextualises features of each Case List A We aim to conduct some site visits depending on available time or alternatively via Microsoft Team meetings where we will interview PNA site leads and HEI leads Proposed possible questions are included List B List A Data collection proposed for contextualisation for each case We will gather demographic data regarding Geographical Location Type of organisation Size of registered nursing workforce Vacancy factors Sickness rates Which PNA training wave Number of PNAs trained by local HEI Number of PNAs in post Number Nurses who have received restorative supervision Review of Trust values and where the PNS program alligns List B PNA NHS site leads and HEI Leads questions As leaders what steer guidance timescale were you given to prepare for the PNA role How do you work together

Description of Study Recruitment Strategy Barriers and Risks pages PNA Evaluation Ethics permission to conduct the PNA evaluation was received during August Strategies in place for the recruitment of participants have been very successful except for nurses receiving restorative clinical supervision All work packages are underway and we are completing the workload aided by a very enthusiastic PNA response Participants Recruited Across the four work packages employing the maximum variation sampling strategy to select from the EOI database we have recruited to each work package completing the following interviews to date Table Table Participants Recruited across the work packages HEI Leads Regional Leads Lead PNAs PNAs Case Studies mixture of site leads and HEI Survey From the survey respondents n indicated they have are undertaking restorative supervision The number of nurses for each PNA providing restorative supervision ranges from upwards with an average of nurses per PNA trained PNAs who responded to the survey were receiving restorative supervision Some respondents however indicated they are not supervising any nurses yet Management oversight The PNA team have met weekly to discuss progress for all work packages of the evaluation giving good oversight at all levels Professorial to Research Associates We have allowed weeks for responses to the recruitment strategies employed Despite support given by NHSE to reach HEI Leads Regional Leads Site PNA Leads PNAs and NRRS we have significant concerns regarding the lack of expressions of interest and subsequent lack of recruitment of nurses receiving restorative clinical supervision RCS despite all strategies to recruit see Table The following recruitment strategies were adopted during June August September and early October to generate expressions of interest from RCS nurses Survey and Interviews Table Recruitment Strategy and expressions of interest EOI to participate in study Strategy primary p or secondary s EOI from EOI from Nurses Regional Lead Receiving PNAs PNAs and Restorative HEI Supervision Poster advertising p Email via NHSE Comms piece p Email via NHSE Survey p Survey embedded question about receiving PNAs supervision receiving supervision Via PNA Interviews s Via Site Lead PNA Interviews s Social Media Twitter x s Potential barriers to recruitment th During our weekly team meeting on October we discussed perspectives that might be contributing to the lack of success in our recruitment plan these are summarised as Nurses who have received restorative supervision may not want to revisit the issues experiences Nurses may be concerned that their privacy will be breached through participation Time to be released to participate in an interview is impossible when on duty stated by PNAs time is not protected evidenced as main theme from survey responses Staff shortages are severe up to shortage and nursing staff are feeling burnt out this is one extra thing to do evidenced from survey responses Lack of ability to implement the model in practice reduces the number of RCS nurses available for interview evidenced from survey RCS may not recognise restorative elements of supervision as supervision informal May not have computer access for MS Teams or Zoom calls May not have access to a private area to discuss the restorative supervision process evidenced from survey Remedial action We will directly contact the PNAs n who responded giving their email address within the survey indicating they had received restorative supervision in their PNA role Within the Case Study qualitative data pre interviews to gain permission approach the Lead PNAs who indicated they have nurses receiving restorative supervision to ask for direct support to reach this group of potential participants Other actions where we would value your advice input It has been indicated in the interviews and survey responses that supervision is a rather formal and sometimes intimidating term It is not always used by the PNAs We could consider changing our terminology to frame restorative supervision as support in practice and refer to the PNA interview transcripts to guide us further in the language being used by PNAs Ask to repeat her tweet via Twitter but with specific appeal to nurses receiving restorative supervision can do same Twitter appeal Ask about the Provider Workforce Return to understand where RCS nurses are based Ask NHSE to send a further recruitment email with information sheet to PNA Site Leads to reach NRRS group o We would ask the site leads to approach PNAs in person to approach their NRRS for discussion rather than relying on the email o We would ask the PNA site leads if an office space can be made available for NRRS use for the interviews or telephone calls We could create some new information to state that o We can accommodate much shorter interviews to minutes o Interviews are confidential they will be a safe space to feedback their experience o Incorporate new terminology replacing the word supervision o We can accommodate any time of the day before or after their shifts o Telephone interviews can be accommodated o We will send the interview questions in advance of the interview Risks to the PNA Evaluation We may need to request an extension to the evaluation to enable us to recruit the NRRS st participants meaning the envisaged finish date January will not be achievable We are concerned that the voice of the NRRS will not be present in the final evaluation Given the huge enthusiasm from the other participants the risk is this will not be representative of the PNA Programme REFERENCES Baumann N How to use the medical subject headings MeSH Int J Clin Pract doi org ijcp

Nursing Survey Report March EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This research report builds on previous work entitled a profile of nurses working in acute medicine units what is the future Lees and Myers which examined three key things why nurses choose to work in acute medicine why they stay in the speciality and why some nurses leave Acute medicine is a rapid growing speciality and alongside this growth is a need to understand and address the evolving workforce issues in particular the education and potential training to support the nursing development required With this in mind the original study from was enhanced to a multi site enrolment totally AMUs across regions who responded to the survey It was conducted between in two phases namely collection of demographic details followed by details concerning motivations and personal insights into the acute medicine workforce Survey Monkey on line commercial platform was used for both elements of the data collection The qualitative data gathered has provided an rich insight into the perspectives of the nurses who work in acute medical units and from this an understanding of the current workforce issues It is hoped that the research will inform the future recruitment retention and the shape of the nursing workforce in acute medicine Key Messages of the nurses surveyed expressed that they feel very positive about working in acute medicine with only expressing negative aspects AMU Nursing Survey Report March Reasons to stay in acute medicine were expressed as positive for the variety of work and experience gained Reasons to leave acute medicine were cited as being due limited career progression lack of resources staffing and lack of recognition of acute medicine as a speciality for nurses Would nurses working in acute medicine make the same choice if they had the opportunity to start their career all over again of the nurses surveyed said yes that they would make the same choice It was expressed that acute medicine is not yet adequately recognised outside of the clinical area itself as a developing speciality for nurses This has consequences for nurse development and recruitment of staff The fast pace relentless workload and staffing shortages were frequently cited as being the most morale reducing and de motivating factors This has consequences for the retention of nursing staff The diversity of patients challenges and teamwork were frequently cited as morale enhancing and motivating factors The key qualities and skills required to work in acute medicine were defined in the following categories namely organisational communication clinicaland personal skills For example personal skills frequently cited were keeping calm under pressure AMU Nursing Survey Report March Core areas for skills training were broadly identified across ten areas with arterial blood gas sampling analysis CPAP x ray interpretation and dementia training forming the most frequently suggested skills areas by those who participated in the research Recommendations This research paints the current landscape in acute medicine which continues to need revisiting amidst technological advances increased patient acuity an ageing population all of which creating an ever increasing diverse workload Four key recommendations have been drawn which are clear way markers to aid the directions of travel for those working to begin to shape the future nursing workforce in acute medicine Lead nurses from acute medicine units should undertake a skills analysis across all nurse bandings to identify the gaps the current training needs of their staff mapped against the skill areas suggested in this research To keep this work updated it is further recommended that this is repeated yearly by individual nurses prior to appraisal This process will assist in identifying personal development plansand continuing professional development set in context the wider needs of acute medicine A thorough understanding of the nursing workload dependency within acute medicine units is urgently required to keep pace with the acuity and volume of patients assessed and admitted Current workforce tools DO NOT provide sufficient information to ensure acute medicine units are able to set their staffing levels adequately safely This is a piece of work which would prove valuable alongside the RCN staffing guidance fro general wards AMU Nursing Survey Report March Staffing duty rotas need to be developed to take account of the potential for burn out and high stress levels it is suggested that adequate time for staff development and CPD are considered with each new rota It maybe possible for AMUs to consider developing different types of nursing roles new where management research service development and training could be incorporated into job descriptions legitimising the development ofsupporting professional activities into job plans Acute medicine units without advanced nursing roles need to consider their development in the context of the skills and training needs analysis These types of roles provide for clinical career progression and align with increasing patient acuity in acute medicine Notwithstanding these roles will need to have a supporting structure in place for continued training and development Liz Lees Nurse Representative Society for acute medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March INTRODUCTION This research report builds on a preliminary study by Lees Myers which examined the experience of nurses working in two acute medical units This study identified that the majority of nurses working in AMU were committed to the specialty and had developed skills in the area despite identifying some issues related to workload and lack of career progression Nevertheless it was recognised that further in depth research was needed to gain a robust understanding of the factors influencing nurses decisions to choose to work in acute medicine with a view to developing strategies for future recruitment retention and progression through an acute medicine career pathway Background Instigating and following a predetermined career pathway remains a relatively new concept for most nurses Department of Health Mitigating factors are multi faceted to include the failure at a national level to recognise of acute medicine as a specialty for nursing For example while it is now recognised for medical staff wishing to pursue a career Royal College of Physicians website accessed February it is not yet widely recognised as a definitive career choice for nurses Although we have learnt that nurses do see acute medicine as an exciting area to work in Lees and Myers revealed that career stagnation was occurring in acute medicine given the time nurses five years are employed in a particular Banding s Pursuing a specific career pathway in acute medicine for nurses requires support at a national level to enable new mechanisms for career progression from Band to Band This means that the current system of waiting for a vacancy to arise and navigating your own career path through experience gained along the way before progression can occur is career limiting except for the fortunate few www skillsforhealth uk Navigation through career options currently relies upon entry AMU Nursing Survey Report March points and academic progression and is contextually applied to settings for example knowledge and experience may not always be accredited or transferrable Concentrating upon these issues alone will not enhance or facilitate career progression in acute medicine specialist career pathways can only be progressed if upon pre requisite academic criteria and experience there is a recognition and reward through career pathways Whilst the attention within this report is focussed upon acute medicine it is thought that this is not the only clinical area where problems of this nature exist Rationale of the study objectives Acute medicine is one of the fastest growing specialties in the UK Royal College of Physicians but as yet there has been no exploration of the nursing workforce issues specific to the specialty There is a need to understand the reasons why nurses choose to work in acute medicine to explore the factors that encourage them to choose this as a career option and to determine the education and training required to support appropriate professional development specific to the specialty STUDY AIMS OBJECTIVES Aim To understand nurses perceptions of working in AMU to aid development of a workforce strategy to support recruitment and retention of AMU nurses Objectives Understand nurses perceptions of working in AMU Identify factors that would aid nurse recruitment to AMU Understand the value of educational opportunities to AMU nurses AMU Nursing Survey Report March Identify factors that would aid the retention of staff Understand the attributes that are perceived as important for the AMU nurse METHODOLOGY Design The survey was designed to be conducted in two phases Phase Survey of Acute Medical Units or equivalent This survey covered the nursing establishment in Acute Medicine in each hospital issues relating to recruitment and retention of nursing staff day to day staffing in the speciality and the structures in place for nursing staff training and development within Acute Medicine Phase Survey of AMU nurses This survey covered nurses personal motivation for joining the specialty perceived positive and negative aspects of their work opportunities for education training and career progression and desire to continue in the specialty The surveys in both phases were designed for use online using Survey Monkey www surveymonkey com a commercial secure online survey platform Each of the two surveys was designed by the Project Team comprising two consultant nurses in Acute Medicine and an observational research specialist with experience of questionnaire design following a standard process Brainstorm general themes to be covered to meet the proposed objectives Draft a list of questions in MS Word Refine question selection wording response format layout and order Incorporate questions into Survey Monkey Test the survey technical set up in Survey Monkey correct skip logic etc Pilot the survey with up to AMU nurse collaborators AMU Nursing Survey Report March Amend question wording response options and layout according to pilot collaborator comments Sample Respondent eligibility Respondents for phase were senior nurses working in Acute Medicine Units AMU One response per hospital was sought from acute hospitals where there was an AMU or equivalent Respondents for phase were nurses of any grade working in Acute Medicine Responses were sought from as many nurses as wished to participate there was no limit on the number of respondents per hospital Recruitment In Phase a response was sought from one senior Acute Medicine nurse in each acute hospital Contact was made with these individuals in a variety of ways according to circumstance Where a senior nurse was a member of the Society for Acute Medicine SAM they were contacted directly via email by the SAM Administrator with an invitation to participate in the survey This applied to only a small number of hospitals For hospitals where there was no nurse member of SAM an Acute Medicine Consultant member of SAM was contacted by email with a request to forward the survey invitation to a senior nursing colleague for completion This applied to the majority of hospitals One reminder was sent to the consultants after weeks to encourage participation of nursing colleagues who had not responded Participation in the survey was also invited at the Annual International Conference of SAM in where volunteers could sign up at a survey stand to receive the survey invitation and link by email In Phase responses were sought from all grades of nurses working in Acute Medicine As in Phase respondents were recruited in a variety of ways Respondents to Phase were contacted directly by email with an invitation to participate AMU Nursing Survey Report March Respondents to Phase were asked to forward the survey invitation email to all nursing colleagues in Acute Medicine and to encourage their participation Respondents to the Phase survey were asked at the end of the survey to supply the name and email address of up to colleagues who may be interested in completing the survey These individuals were then sent the email invitation Participation was invited at the Annual International Conference of SAM in where volunteers could either sign up at a survey stand to receive the survey invitation and link by email or complete the survey directly at the conference or nominate colleagues to receive the survey invitation All invitees were sent an email reminder weeks after the initial invitation except where they had supplied their email address at the end of the survey and so were known to have completed it Participation was encouraged by the offer of inclusion in a prize draw for all participants with prizes of a free place at the next SAM International conference and books on Acute Medicine Nursing Data collection survey Survey responses were collected via the Survey Monkey website for the phase survey between June and September and for the phase survey between October and February The survey questions are shown in appendix phase survey and appendix phase survey Analysis Qualitative analysis The data analysis of responses to open questions free text responses was conducted using a qualitative approach It was appropriate to use qualitative analysis in order to explore the area and allow for spontaneous findings Amongst the various qualitative methods available which differ in the way ideas are interpreted from the data Thematic Analysis was chosen to carry out explorations Framework Analysis predefines themes prior AMU Nursing Survey Report March to data scrutiny Inductive Analysis whereas Thematic Analysis only allows themes to emerge from the data Data was coded displayed and manipulated throughout the analysis in order to allow for the creation of themes After gathering the data from the surveys an initial coding frame was designed An iterative process was used through which the codes from the initial coding scheme were further developed Coding credibility was ensured by an independent researcher who checked for meanings of codes and agreed on themes Themes were arranged in matrices in order to evaluate the data as well as to evaluate associations and divergences Emerging codes were included in the coding matrices Codes were illustrated using quotations of participants in order to reproduce accurate perceptions The interpretations of the meanings were validated externally by three independent researchers who agreed on conclusions Quantitative analysis Analyses are descriptive in nature Both distributions and descriptive statistics of both central tendency medians and arithmetic or geometric means and dispersion standard deviation interquartile range are presented for quantitative variables Nominal variables are described with frequencies and percentages while ordinal variables also have medians and interquartile ranges described For the quantitative data study databases were developed by pH Associates using Microsoft TM Excel based on the survey questions The results of the online surveys were downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet and then transferred into the databases for analysis Where data was missing i e questions left blank the affected analysis was conducted using only those responses recorded There are occasions in the results section where percentages may appear not to add up to this is due to rounding The following assumptions were applied during data analysis Acute Medicine Nursing Workforce Survey Stage AMU Nursing Survey Report March Q Units recorded average monthly acute medical admissions of or less patients As these figures appear to be too low to be correct they have been excluded from the analysis For Q Q Q Q Where some sections of the question had been completed and others sections left bank it was assumed the figure for the blank section s was zero For example if band band band blank and band had been recorded for Q the data would have been included in the analysis as six band nurses seven band nurses zero band nurses and one band nurse AMU Nursing Survey Report March RESULTS Respondent Demographics Organisational Survey Phase Total sample size n Sixty

March Appendix shows the main codes identified in the qualitative analysis and their description What factors positively influenced you and your colleagues in favour of applying for a job in Acute Medicine The first code positive factors personal describes reasons that positively influenced nurses surveyed in favour of applying for Acute Medicine The second code positive factors colleague describes respondents perception of factors that could have positively influenced nurse colleagues in favour of choosing Acute Medicine Personal reasons for working in Acute Medicine follow the same pattern as colleagues reasons therefore will be presented together The majority of nurses surveyed were drawn to Acute Medicine by the acute nature of patients the fast pace the inter professionalism the unpredictability and diversity of medical conditions treated Some nurses joined Acute Medicine because of career opportunities Acute Medicine was perceived to be intellectually and emotionally challenging a good environment to develop and transfer knowledge and skills career development a good opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team to make a difference to patients and an opportunity to influence the service No clear relationship seemed to exist between positive factors and years of practice or previous experience I really enjoy acute admissions and having opportunities to work with a vast range of medical conditions I thought the fast pace and quick turnover of patients would be challenging A good environment to maintain develop and learn a wide range of skills Participant years in Acute Medicine Initially it was to serve as a gateway to working in ED as I thought it would be good experience However I learned so much and loved the acute side of it whilst still being able to care for my patients for longer than four hours so stayed Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March The acute care appeals to some nurses I feel you are either born to nurse acute patients or you are not I think you have to have a certain nature and stamina with a drive to succeed if you work in an acute medical setting Participant years in Acute Medicine The variety of conditions the pace of the work different every day Some thrive on the challenge and pressure Participant years in Acute Medicine Dynamic setting that had a broad range of patients with urgent needs Challenging intellectually and emotionally Participant years in Acute Medicine What factors influence nurses against applying for a job in Acute Medicine The third code negative factors describes reasons that respondents thought might have negatively influenced nurses against applying for Acute Medicine In general respondents described a wide range of negatives that did not contribute to the decision of applying for Acute Medicine Nurses who had worked for less time in Acute Medicine were in general more optimistic about it The most common negative factor identified was the fast pace which is on the contrary seen by some as a positive factor making this speciality interesting and highly skilled The majority of nurses commenting negatively described the limited time patients spend in AMU as affecting delivery of quality care and poor continuity of care The perception was that Acute Medicine can be too chaotic with too much pressure involved and too many unknowns for experienced staff due to the variety of medical conditions and patient presentations encountered Some respondents described the lack of career progression and job satisfaction as two of the main negative reasons that influence nurses against applying for jobs in Acute Medicine Other negative factors listed include staff shortages the emotional burden of caring and poor leadership Lack of essential skills not able to keep up the pace of critical and busy environment lack of insight AMU Nursing Survey Report March Participant years in Acute Medicine Nurse to patient ratios poor quality care given as a direct result of environmental pressures for acute beds Very rarely get to spend any length of time with patients feels more task orientated rather than being able to give holistic care Compromises often made due to environmental pressures lack of working equipment lack of ability to take timely breaks Participant years in Acute Medicine Fear of unknown I feel that ALL student nurses should be given the opportunity to work within acute medicine to gain an insight into the ethos of the clinical area The constant problems with bed management and the acute medical unit taking the hit for this on a daily basis Participant years in Acute Medicine Not everybody likes the unpredictability of the work and many nurses do not enjoy looking after very sick patients or do not have the skills and experience to do so Some ward based staff have said that they feel acute medicine on an AMU is like a conveyor belt and that the patient contact is rushed and superficial Participant years in Acute Medicine Busy autonomous Need to be strong and confident Not recognised as a speciality by other specialities few acute medical physicians and not recognised nationally as a nursing speciality Participant years in Acute Medicine Extremely busy patients can be extremely demanding stressful environment lack of time to develop due to staff pressures Participant years in Acute Medicine It can be stressful for nurses with less experience and lack of opportunities to learn through inadequate mentorship and clinical support Participant years in Acute Medicine What training courses and or study days relevant to Acute Medicine have you attended in the last year The fourth code development describes training courses and or study days relevant to Acute Medicine that respondents have attended in the last year The majority of nurses surveyed had attended ALS Advanced Life Support ILS Intermediate Life Support Critical Care Acute specific courses AMU Nursing Survey Report March Management Courses related to governance risk ward incidents safety leadership conflict complaints workforce planning impact patient flow Clinical Courses related to medicines risk incidents ECG anaphylaxis hypoglycaemia insulin dementia drug therapy in Mental Health DVT blood transfer infection ultrasound nicotine intravenous injection differential diagnosis Other training

the ALERT course and have taken on running this while the consultant is away on maternity leave I do distance learning modules as part of my CPD for non medical prescribing as well as for my acute care role recently did a module on managing anaphylaxis Participant years in Acute Medicine What experiential learning learning in practice relevant to Acute Medicine have you received in the last year The majority of nurses surveyed had not received formal experiential learning Some had done mentoring shadowing but there was no evidence of any formal system in place for development and experiential learning The perception of some respondents was that Acute Medicine is not as dynamic as other specialities and that there is little support for professional development and for the majority of nurses AMU Nursing Survey Report March My own reading around subjects Participant years in Acute Medicine None within last year Participant years in Acute Medicine Consultants always available to answer questions and queries Generally have to learn on the job Participant years in Acute Medicine None specific but have had allocated time within the MSc in being mentored by the acute medical physicians Participant years in Acute Medicine Regularly with the acute medical consultants recently the insertion of ascetic drains including observing them and then being observed

respondents did not record details of any further training or education they felt they needed to do their current job and respondents did not record any training or education they would like for career development This may be because they did not feel they needed any further education or training or they may have chosen not to answer this question Over one fifth of nurses who did respond identified further training in core skills namely advanced life support CPAP and care of dementia delirium patients to achieve competence in their current role Advanced assessment skills arterial blood gas sampling and X ray interpretation were the more advanced skills also identified by more than one fifth of respondents What are the best things about working in Acute Medicine The fifth code best things describes what nurses identify as the best things about working in Acute Medicine Participants described the diversity and variety of Acute Medicine the satisfaction of seeing patients recover the development of skills the satisfaction of making a difference and saving lives and the inter professional relationships as the best things about working in Acute Medicine Some highlighted the fast pace the challenging environment the interesting nature of the speciality and being respected by other colleagues Acute medicine is diverse and unpredictable which in my opinion makes it interesting Nurses working in acute care need to develop their knowledge in order to provide the level of care required Developing knowledge and learning advanced skills enables me to do more for my patient This ensures patients are given more timely and efficient care and that poorly patients are recognised sooner and the appropriate care is given Participant years in Acute Medicine Variety and different every day Participant years in Acute Medicine I love the business of the day and that the shifts go so fast You also get to see very sick patients improve over a couple of hours with intensive treatment Participant years in Acute Medicine The pace of change The team I work with The ability to push boundaries and move forward The ability to make a real difference to patients in a short space of time Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March Working as an ANP within the ambulatory care unit also lead nurse for thrombosis and anticoagulation service the best things are being instrumental in assessing patients with acute medical illness and facilitating same day discharge with review The work is exciting utilising many of the fundamentals of nursing as well as extended roles it is the hub of the medical floor Participant years in Acute Medicine The variety of patients and their conditions The busy environment Knowing a little about a lot of conditions rather than specialising in one area Participant years in Acute Medicine Challenging environment Dynamic team Varied workload unpredictable new skills and knowledge Participant years in Acute Medicine Job satisfaction from seeing a critically ill patient improve I am a ward manager and enjoy seeing my staff progress MDT team ethics Participant years in Acute Medicine Challenging variance teamwork and the autonomy to make changes and drive service improvement Respected by other colleagues Participant years in Acute Medicine The unpredictable clinical environment caring for someone acutely unwell Participant years in Acute Medicine Variability of patient conditions never boring Managing acutely unwell patients Participant year in Acute Medicine What are the worst things about working in Acute Medicine The sixth code worst things describes what nurses identify as the worst things about working in Acute Medicine Respondents described pressure lack of resources and tiredness as the worst things about working in Acute Medicine This is linked to the difficulty of delivering a good standard of care at the pace that the speciality requires as well as the unpredictable workload issues with capacity and flow and the volume of documentation Lack of equipment staff AMU Nursing Survey Report March shortages lack of managerial support lack of time for training and development and no clear career pathway for nurses to follow were identified as major areas of strain A minority of nurses also described the fact that acute medicine is not recognised as a unique specialty for nurse and the lower salary compared to other areas of practice Patient care becomes compromised when working under extreme pressure Interprofessional working and collaboration can be a problem Stereotypes exist and it can be very hard to break down barriers between professional groups Accessing community beds and continuing care Participant years in Acute Medicine Hectic and pressure to move patients on quickly Participant years in Acute Medicine Endless inappropriate admissions Especially elderly patients from nursing homes who should be managed in the nursing home Harassment from management and lack of support Poor staffing levels Participant years in Acute Medicine The long days and not enough support from senior medical colleagues Participant years in Acute Medicine The politics Am often blamed for the bottlenecks in the service by those who do not understand it Participant years in Acute Medicine At times unsafe care poor standards of care given poor documentation Participant years in Acute Medicine The constant pressure lack of resources lack of staff Being made to work in unsafe circumstances as we are so busy yet we are told to get more patients up as they will breach if they stay in A E Never get breaks AMU gets used as HDU when no beds are available or if the doctors think they are too poorly to be moved to a ward as the patient will receive better acute care on AMU Participant years in Acute Medicine Relentless workload on days elderly population lack of resources staff beds feeling out of control Feeling like it is a dumping ground for all As an ANP feeling that you have to be all to everyone Participant years in Acute Medicine The pressures from outside e g ED and the wards AMU Nursing Survey Report March Participant years in Acute Medicine Managerial structure and financial restrictions Participant years in Acute Medicine Often stressful chaotic and difficult to support redeployed staff or new starters as staff need to work under pressure at a fast pace relatively quickly Bed management Participant years in Acute Medicine Stress No breaks A E breeches and targets directly put immense pressure on AAU Throughput of patients and targets takes priority over patient care Nothing ever gets followed through as patients are moved about so frequently Participant year in Acute Medicine Not enough money is spent to improve the patient care Participant years in Acute Medicine Salary scale compared to A E staff and other specialist areas I believe that nurses in Acute Assessment Units mostly work under extreme pressure and we are expected to simply carry on with no extra support Participant years in Acute Medicine Not being able to support junior staff due to clinical demands Participant years in Acute Medicine Not enough time support or often correct nursing ratio for those considered level patients versus level acute admissions Limited lack of recognition of acute medicine as a unique speciality in and of itself There appears to be a lack of understanding that an AMU is not a ward and not A E but rather something in between which needs to be run and staffed differently Limited time and funding to train and develop acute care skills for staff Participant year in Acute Medicine What are the most important reasons why you chose to work in Acute Medicine rather than another specialty The seventh code why acute medicine refers to the most important reasons why the nurses surveyed chose to work in Acute Medicine rather than other specialties Respondents described diversity variety acute nature fast pace and adrenaline as the main reason to have chosen Acute Medicine rather than other specialities There is an element about job satisfaction working in a team seeing patients get better making a difference AMU Nursing Survey Report March rewarding that encouraged the decision of working in Acute Medicine A minority of nurses decided to apply for a job in Acute Medicine because they saw it as an opportunity for development or role expansion To help patients who are acutely ill frightened and distressed then to go home and feel I have made a difference I also enjoy supporting junior colleagues in this speciality Participant years in Acute Medicine I was interested from its inception as it contained all the elements that I was interested in i e ED without the minor injuries and trauma medical wards without the long stay elements ITU without the ventilators When I started nursing it had not been developed In the early days nurses were very much in charge of the organisation of the acute take as there were no consistent medical teams only on call physicians who did not usually input actively into the development of the service Participant years in Acute Medicine I enjoy acute medicine Participant years in Acute Medicine Diversity Participant years in Acute Medicine I enjoy looking after the patients I feel like every day is a challenge and a learning opportunity Participant years in Acute Medicine The variety and being constantly on the go Participant years in Acute Medicine I feel that I can make a difference Participant years in Acute Medicine I enjoy the pace of work always love medicine not sure why Participant years in Acute Medicine Just seemed the right thing to do at the time When I first joined was a new venture which continues to evolve Participant years in Acute Medicine This was not my chosen path Participant year in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March Diversity the challenge of leading a team of such strong characters job satisfaction flow of patients I enjoy the pressure for now Participant years in Acute Medicine It relies on teamwork everyone has to work for it to work Participant years in Acute Medicine It is quite rewarding Participant years in Acute Medicine The chance to work with more acutely unwell ward based patients where I could use my critical care skills and develop my management skills Participant year in Acute Medicine What would you say are the personal qualities a nurse needs to work in Acute Medicine The eighth code acute nurse qualities describes the personal qualities that the nurses surveyed feel a nurse needs to have in order to work in Acute Medicine It seems that working in Acute Medicine requires a variety of qualities that can be clustered into the following categories Communication Skills empathy with the patient good listening skills good speaking skills Organisational Skills personal self management multitasking flexibility adaptability being able to prioritise Management Skills team persistence perseverance team player leadership working to maintain and improve quality motivation forward thinking Personal

nursing that you think has helped you in your work in Acute Medicine No Yes n What work life experience has helped you in your work in Acute Medicine The ninth code previous experience describes how work life experiences have helped surveyed nurses in their work in Acute Medicine The response rate for this question was not as high as for the previous ones Nurses described previous work experience family experiences personal experiences and personal values as the things that helped them the most working in Acute Medicine Previous work life experience dealing with different people dealing with different situations were logical and empathetic thinking is needed previous nursing career critical care negotiation skills dealing with situations with high expectation demanding situations being a mother Family experience family member cared for in Acute Medicine Personal experience having been an inpatient AMU Nursing Survey Report March Personal values morals Some nurses described balancing their job with their hobbies as a positive influence that helps in Acute Medicine Family members cared for in acute medicine Participant years in Acute Medicine I came into nursing later in life than most students I feel that my work experiences of dealing with many people from different walks of life certainly helped me Participant years in Acute Medicine My extensive nursing career and experience in ITU general medicine and ED Participant years in Acute Medicine A parent with heart disease Participant years in Acute Medicine I have been an inpatient in hospital a couple of times the first time when I was therefore I can empathise with the patients I also have a neurotic mother who has had some kind of medical mental crisis almost every day of her life which has enabled me to take any kind of trauma or emergency in my stride Participant years in Acute Medicine Being a mother Enjoying my hobbies such as hiking horse riding Participant years in Acute Medicine Many years of experience as a nurse was ward manager of MAU prior to CNS role exposure to variable situations where logic and empathetic thinking is needed Participant years in Acute Medicine I am a mother of young children and therefore have to be very organised As I am used to sorting out arguments at home it transfers very easily to the work place as there are strong characters who argue a lot Participant years in Acute Medicine Discipline and commitment Participant years in Acute Medicine I started my training when I was and before then I had travelled I believe your own life experiences allow you to develop as a person and manage situations better Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March Has working in Acute Medicine been different from what you expected If yes how has it been different The tenth code acute medicine work expectations describes in what ways working in Acute Medicine has been or has not been different from what was expected by the surveyed nurses Opinions with regards to this theme were split more than half of the participants surveyed expected Acute Medicine to be as it is whereas less than half of the nurses surveyed found that working in Acute Medicine was different than expected for most of them it was positively different The reasons given were similar to those in previous questions No not really Participant years in Acute Medicine It has evolved over the years Participant years in Acute Medicine Poor staffing ratios for unpredictable workload Participant years in Acute Medicine It has been very difficult at times however the way the MDTs work within acute medicine is excellent much more of a team than the other areas where I have worked Nurses opinions seem to be valued a lot more Participant years in Acute Medicine Much busier so much more to learn Participant years in Acute Medicine It has given me more opportunities than I imagined and has kept my interest Participant years in Acute Medicine It has changed so much over the years but it is underrated Participant years in Acute Medicine Yes I did not realise it would be so tiring Participant years in Acute Medicine Yes more stressful AMU Nursing Survey Report March Participant year in Acute Medicine In some aspects it has become less rewarding as patient care has moved down the list of priorities although not officially but in other ways it has become more exciting with increasing opportunities for nurses Participant years in Acute Medicine Yes I never believed that I could work in an area for years and still be passionate about it and want to continually push the service to the next level I will never be bored of AM Participant years in Acute Medicine Is has been better than I expected Participant years in Acute Medicine I realised it was even busier than I had thought I learned that the primary focus appeared to be on EDD and transfer discharge with limited focus on the more acutely unwell patients I found out that there appeared to be far too much paper work especially for those patients staying a brief period I thought this could be streamlined to allow nurses to spend more time with their patients I realised just how difficult an area it is to work in especially for very junior nurses if adequate senior support was not available I realised just how challenging it was to balance the needs and expectations of the variety of patients admitted Participant year in Acute Medicine Figure Overall how do you feel about working in Acute Medicine Very positive I love it Moderately positive it s mostly good Indifferent neither positive or negative Moderately negative it s mostly bad Very negative I hate it n AMU Nursing Survey Report March Figure Have you tried to find a job in another specialty since you have been working in Acute Medicine Yes No n Why did do you want to move For those nurses surveyed who had tried to find another job whilst working in Acute Medicine the eleventh code reasons to move describes why they decided to do so The nurses that responded that they would like to move from Acute Medicine reported that this was due to the lack of staff and working equipment the lack of motivation the poor quality of care the lack of career development opportunities the excessive pressure some want to quit nursing in general not only Acute Medicine the excessive managerial issues and the excessive expectations and workload Most of them would like to move in order to develop further and to foster job progression Progression in my role as a nurse Participant years in Acute Medicine Poor quality of patient care unsafe workload lack of timely breaks lack of staff to monitor patients whilst on a break lack of working and available equipment go home exhausted Participant years in Acute Medicine The pressure as a band is even more intense I have been a band for years now and I have watched the unit become more and more compromised due to managerial decisions and lack of awareness of the impact these decisions have on the unit and indeed the NHS I want to leave nursing not just AMU AMU Nursing Survey Report March Participant years in Acute Medicine Further experience of the critically ill patient I worked in ITU for years Participant years in Acute Medicine I was drowning in paperwork management issues as the senior sister on the unit too much is expected in my trust We are facing a real crisis in this role as it is becoming more difficult to recruit into to reach a senior sister position was once a real aim in the profession it no longer is Participant years in Acute Medicine My job role was changed at one point into something that was poorly thought out and ill defined with no discussion with me at all this left me demoralised and angry In the end I worked towards changing the role I was given into something completely different and stayed Participant years in Acute Medicine I wanted to further develop my clinical skills in Acute Medicine and I have by working in medical HDU which is still part of Acute Medicine Participant years in Acute Medicine What changes would encourage you to continue to work in Acute Medicine The twelfth code reasons to stay describes what changes would encourage nurses who responded they wanted to move from Acute Medicine to continue to work in this speciality This question has a low response rate as not many nurses replied they were trying wanting to find a job outside Acute Medicine Participants explained that it would probably be easier to stay in Acute Medicine if there were more opportunities for people to progress and develop if there was a better nurse to patient ratio better equipment and fewer episodes of staff shortages Other reasons were a managerial focus on quality of care rather than balancing budgets and better strategic and operational planning by managers It seems that despite its flaws most nurses would never consider leaving Acute Medicine More opportunities for people to progress and develop Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March Better nurse to patient ratio On AMU we admit GP admissions and they are among the most unwell often can take half an hour plus to admit properly Feel lack of available staff DOES directly influence timely meds poor quality care Staff exhaustion Better equipment less patients coming through the unit more staff and the trust returning to a patient centred trust instead of a money sign Participant years in Acute Medicine I came back to acute medicine Participant years in Acute Medicine More support Participant years in Acute Medicine I will probably stay anyway because however bad it gets I am sure that after a few weeks elsewhere I would miss acute med I wish there was some more joined up thinking in management and a whole hospital approach to improving patient flows Participant years in Acute Medicine Continued opportunities to develop clinical skills Proper workforce tool to identify staffing needs in acute medicine thereby retaining workforce Participant years in Acute Medicine Getting the nurse patient ratio right More time and support for training Streamlining of nursing assessments and documentation Participant year in Acute Medicine How do you feel about the opportunities for career progression in Acute Medicine The thirteenth code career opportunities describes how nurses feel about the opportunities for career progression in Acute Medicine The majority of nurses surveyed have negative feeling towards career opportunities and self development in Acute Medicine Career opportunities were seen to be either fairly limited poor restricted or non existent There is a general feeling that there is not much opportunity for band and staff apart from secondments unless they aspire to be a ward manager band or a specialist nurse in a general medicine speciality At ward manager level a limited progression exists to matron lead nurse or consultant nurse with promotion often necessitating a movie away from Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March For some nurses their experiences regarding career development have been very positive These nurses feel that the potential for development of advanced practice roles in Acute Medicine is excellent if you are willing to work hard and look for opportunities Fairly limited Participant years in Acute Medicine Reasonable Participant years in Acute Medicine I do not think there are many opportunities for career progression for Nursing on the whole not only in Acute Medicine I had to move into management to go up the career ladder however as I now have an operational role I enjoy the best of both aspects Participant years in Acute Medicine Very positive The potential for the development of advanced practice roles in this specialty is huge Participant years in Acute Medicine Poor Participant years in Acute Medicine There is not much unless you want to be a ward manager or a specialist nurse in a general medical speciality Participant years in Acute Medicine Good if willing to work hard Participant years in Acute Medicine No opportunities whatsoever Participant years in Acute Medicine Poor however if you have ideas then they should be shared Quite often I have found you make your own career progression as long as it s sound and contributes I am a senior ANP with a research educational background Where do I go to Participant years in Acute Medicine It is there if you need it and go looking for it Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March Personally they have been excellent I have had opportunities to study with funding and support to achieve a degree in Specialist Practice and am soon to be commencing my MSc I have worked though the old grade system D E to become a sister and am now a nurse practitioner The opportunities have been there for me to work towards Participant years in Acute Medicine I am already a senior ward manager therefore very limited progression i e only matron or lead nurse available or specialist nurses Participant years in Acute Medicine Not very good at present As a Band there do not appear to be any opportunities to progress into ANP roles etc This is partly due to the fact that as a Band it is not in our job description to undertake nurse prescribing therefore progression is limited to a managerial Band post Participant years in Acute Medicine From a nursing management perspective they are quite poor Clinical progression to ANP is possible Participant years in Acute Medicine They are exciting and I hope if it gets recognised within nursing as a unique speciality within its own rights more opportunities will arise Participant years in Acute Medicine As an ANP I am outside the main career pathway for AMU staff There is little visible investment in development of band and nurses beyond the secondment of band s into band development posts for months however actual development is limited to experience in coordinating and I see them receive little structured development out of the experience There is no plan for developing careers or service development by encouraging staff to consider branching off into something similar such as NP roles Participant years in Acute Medicine Very good I have been given opportunity to progress Participant years in Acute Medicine Limited I am constantly informed that I need to consider promotion but this would mean a move away from acute medicine I never want that I can do what I want as far as service improvement strategy planning etc but this does not move me up the career ladder as such This is as well as my day job But I am happy to continue Participant years in Acute Medicine Not sure it is not quite clear cut Participant years in Acute Medicine AMU Nursing Survey Report March I have been fortunate in that I have progressed to the level I am happy with at present Participant years in Acute Medicine Table What is your current pay band and how long have you been at this pay band How long have you been at this pay band to to Pay band to years years years Total Band Band Band Band a Band b Total What changes would make the biggest improvement to your job satisfaction in Acute Medicine The fourteenth code job satisfaction describes changes that respondents reported would make the biggest improvement to their job satisfaction in Acute Medicine The nurses interviewed described the following factors that could positively influence job satisfaction in Acute Medicine career progression opportunity to develop skills and knowledge adequate staff and support from management greater understanding of Acute Medicine by others particularly in relation to capacity and flow issues improved staff communication and feedback ability to give a higher standard of care less documentation and less pressure on beds Nurse prescribing a clearer definition of roles greater recognition for acute medicine and financial investment were also identified Career progression Develop skills and knowledge Participant years in Acute Medicine Adequate staff and proper support from management Participant years in Acute Medicine More understanding from other wards and departments especially in relation to capacity issues Participant years in Acute Medicine Greater understanding of AM by other specialities AMU Nursing Survey Report March Participant years in Acute Medicine Improved staff communication from doctors nurses and all members of MDT Able to give a higher standard of care I leave feeling disappointed that the care I give to patients is forced to at times below the ability to being able to provide basic care and proper initial assessments Participant years in Acute Medicine Leaving Participant years in Acute Medicine Safe staffing levels Participant years in Acute Medicine My own clinic joint role with education research Consultant Nurse perhaps but not bothered about title Participant years in Acute Medicine More staff patient ratio thereby enabling us to provide higher standards of care Participant years in Acute Medicine Being able to do nurse prescribing Participant years in Acute Medicine I think there need to be clear guidelines as to what an AMU is and it cannot be the answer to all things as some trusts would have it If it is to be used as anything else bar an AMU this needs to be resourced and systems introduced to enable it to function effectively The team needs clear definitions of their role More acute physicians It feels that organisationally blanket risk assessments are being applied to all patients and there is a danger of slow death by drowning from documentation Staff also require the infrastructure to care for their patients effectively Improved back door patient flow would have the biggest impact on our AMU Participant years in Acute Medicine More feedback Participant years in Acute Medicine More downstream beds Time to support and mentor junior nurses to ensure staff get breaks Participant year in Acute Medicine AMU feels to me like it is stuck in the middle between the ED the Medical Division ED quality indicators seem to be reducing quality patients are transferred with initiation of AMU Nursing Survey Report March treatment sometimes A slightly larger bed base in the medical division would allow for AMU to slow down slightly and improve quality Participant years in Acute Medicine If managers stopped harassing the staff who are already working flat out and looked a little more critically at the posts within the organisation that do not deliver tangible benefits or value for money this is starting to happen Participant years in Acute Medicine Recognition of acute medicine and investment by the Trust Participant years in

feel you have a strong sense of specialist identity working in Acute Medicine n s e s r u n f o Agree strongly Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree neither agree strongly nor disagree AMU Nursing Survey Report March Figure If you were to start your nursing career all over again would you still choose to work in Acute Medicine No Yes n Despite the many negative comments about the problems of working in AMU the overwhelming majority of nurses would still choose the specialty again AMU Nursing Survey Report March DISCUSSION Main findings Sixty two nurses senior completed the organisational phase survey The sample appeared to be representative of all regions of the UK with the exception of Northern Ireland More than half of the units had between and beds while had more than beds Thus the units responding appear to be representative of the wide range of units across the country The majority of units had few level beds with many having none The lack of provision for level beds is likely to increase the demands on the AMU nursing workforce as they endeavour to provide care for these high dependency patients alongside the relentless pace of admitting and discharging less acutely sick patients The rate of monthly admissions appeared broadly similar to the size of the units reported The length of stay in the unit was under hours for just under half of the respondents but it was acknowledged that the intended length of stay was often exceeded Reasons for exceeding optimum length of stay frequently related to issues of capacity and flow in the downstream wards and inability to transfer patients who required side room facilities for clinical reasons A wide range of WTE registered nurse staffing establishments was reported perhaps reflecting the differing size and throughput of units although this cannot be assumed Anecdotally we are aware that there is a significant variation in staffing levels even among units of similar size This is a reflection of the heterogeneity of AMUs It would have been helpful if we had asked for direct information on staff to patient ratios instead of staffing establishments The breakdown of nurses per band reflects the lack of opportunity for progression reported in phase of the survey This is a significant cause for concern as we strive to encourage recruitment into the specialty and to promote retention of experienced AMU Nursing Survey Report March nursing staff Medical staff have clearly defined progression through the ranks of their chosen specialty that is linked to an educational framework research opportunities and financial remuneration Respondents reported a small number of non registered practitioners within some units The majority were employed on band and opportunities for progression were limited It was noted that even when a training framework was in place attaining a higher banding was impossible due to the current financial situation Many units reported having current vacancies for both registered and non registered staff with frequent use of both bank and to a lesser extent agency staff to fill gaps in staffing Worryingly only f respondents stated that they never had problems filling vacant shifts suggesting that many units are working under strength on a frequent basis The reasons for vacancies were attributed to high sickness levels non filling of posts to meet savings targets and delays in the recruitment process This is both a risk to patients and to existing staff due to increased workload and risk of burnout Sixty five nurses from at least different hospitals completed the phase survey For the majority nursing was their first career which is reflected in the preponderance of entrants aged years or less Almost half of respondents had more than years experience in the AMU with three quarters having worked in another specialty first This is unsurprising given the relatively new nature of the specialty in many hospitals The positive factors which nurses attributed to AMU were the fast pace acuity variety and unpredictability nature of the specialty Team working and strong inter professional relationships were also highlighted frequently For many nurses the AMU was reported to be intellectually and emotionally challenging with opportunities to develop skills and make a difference to patients However for other respondents the fast pace and acuity of care AMU Nursing Survey Report March appeared to have a negative effect with too much unpredictability too much pressure and lack of continuity of care cited Although there did not appear to be a clear relationship between positive factors years of practice or previous experience the negative comments above appeared to be related to less experienced staff When this is considered alongside the questions related to training education and experiential learning it is clear that more investment and planning is required to meet the needs of AMU nurses This is borne out by the fact that nurses reported requiring a wide range of training related to core skills to achieve competence in their current role The acquisition of advanced practice skills was also identified and will be key to developing an appropriate multi professional workforce for the future Most concerning of all were the negative comments cited by many nurses even those who were positive about working in AMU as a career choice These comments related mainly to lack of resources poor management support lack of understanding of the demands of AMU from other areas within the hospital and externally and constant demands to maintain flow even at the expense of quality person centred patient care It is no surprise then that the personal qualities deemed to be necessary for the AMU nurse to survive were as much about calmness persistence and optimism as they were about organisational management and clinical skills Despite these considerable difficulties of nurses responding would still choose to work in acute medicine Limitations The main limitation of this study is the selection of a convenience sample in both phases Although several approaches were taken to maximise participation in the study the response rates are relatively small and the participants may be more engaged in the specialty due to the methods of sampling Thus it cannot be assumed that the respondents AMU Nursing Survey Report March were representative of all AMU nurses in the UK However a diversity of views were elicited giving some confidence in the findings and replicating the results of the previous pilot study A further limitation is that AMUs are heterogeneous in nature varying in size configuration and throughput while some are actually combined medical surgical assessment units The size and throughput of the unit and the hospital may have a significant effect on the experience of the nursing staff which has the potential to bias the results However the results of the phase study show that a range of sizes of AMU have been captured with a reasonable geographical spread across the UK with the exception of Northern Ireland Another limitation is the design of the questionnaire itself which may have been interpreted differently by different respondents The inclusion of free text throughout the phase survey was intended to allow respondents to share their views freely and to allow themes to emerge Comparison with other literature A general search of the literature was conducted on four databases relevant to nursing namely Directory of Open Access Journals the Cochrane Library CINAHL and SSRN The search terms included three key words initially Career Nurses and Pathways The search was expanded with the addition of the words Acute Acute Medicine which yielded zero articles of relevant The search was repeated with the addition of Acute Challenges Opportunities and Planning Eleven articles were systematically reviewed with five of these forming the basis for comparison with other literature The challenges which need to be addressed in order to implement a robust career pathway for acute medicine nurses are not dissimilar to findings by Latter et al in her consideration of the challenges for implementing a clinical academic career pathway in nursing For example the general political awareness for supporting career pathways in this AMU Nursing Survey Report March case nurses working in acute medicine needs to be raised at a national level and is perhaps of equal importance to any underpinning educational planning required Latter found this has been a critical success factor driving the general impetus on Clinical Academic Careers presently DH In addition a framework for supporting rewarding the evidence of individual development whilst working in acute medicine is also critical as can be seen from this research nurses may enter acute medicine from a variety of backgrounds This work is exemplified by Williams and Jordan in who state that Portfolios are an underused resource and should be used as a vehicle to contain the evidence from which to format career plans This supports the concept of moving away from using them for year on year Appraisals or Nursing Midwifery Regulation on notification of practice and re registration If we consider further that the entry point of nursing maybe from a variety of areas to include newly registered nurses Marsland and Hickey suggest that despite encouragement in nurse training to pursue an acute career unless this expectation is matched equalled by experience in the speciality we will not achieve nurses who want to climb an acute career pathway Acute in this context was not specifically related to medicine rather whole hospital Finally if we consider a range of issues as a conglomerate notably career planning pathways and opportunities it would seem that the extent to which career pathways of nurses truly represent personal choice and opportunity is often limited by the organisation s response to financial constraints which in turn limit its organisational vision and capacity to drive change Notwithstanding the national impetus would seem to be a key driver of change in nurses recruitment and career progression Robinson et al AMU Nursing Survey Report March Recommendations for further research clinical practice The findings of this study suggest that there are several critical areas which need to be addressed Lack of formal recognition as a nursing specialty outside acute medicine itself Lack of professional development opportunities and career progression Poor management understanding and support Lack of resources capacity equipment and staff Capacity and flow issues in downstream wards leading to bottlenecks in AMU Inappropriate documentation CONCLUSION Prior to this study the literature revealed no previous research into factors that aid recruitment and retention within acute medicine settings related to nursing This study utilised an online survey design to elicit the views and experience of registered nurses working within AMUs to determine these factors For the majority of nurses AMU remains a popular career choice with a strong sense of specialist identity despite the limited opportunities for professional development and career progression However the findings of this study suggest that there is considerable work to do to promote the identity of the specialty to managers the rest of the healthcare community and public Managers and commissioners holding public purse are responsible for the apportioning of budgets to individual areas It is hoped that those reading this report will gain an understanding of how nurses feel and use the information wisely to nurture and develop staff The issues of lack of resources poor management support and stressful working conditions require urgent action lest we lose large numbers of highly expert and committed practitioners with serious consequences for patient care Lessons can be learnt from developing career pathways for AMU Nursing Survey Report March nursing in academic careers not least raising the national profile of nursing in this acute medicine speciality The results of this study can also be used in further work and at a local level to understand workforce issues and develop a career framework for nursing in acute medicine similar to that developed for
