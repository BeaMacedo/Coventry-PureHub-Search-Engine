read agement services or services that are commissioned by local health with sadness about the recent closure of one such local authority authorities Since the responsibility for commissioning sits with ICSs this commissioned service which has been held in high regard both nation is likely to represent a small proportion of services A further limitation ally and locally by the patients it

the unantic the commissioning of bariatric surgery and weight management services ipated findings was that one ICS that does not commission a Tier in England and thus we welcome further collaboration

such cir The current work highlights significant inequity with access to cumstances service providers outside the ICS are not obliged to accept effective treatment whether that be geographically or by locally This is an important point about the provision and funding of care for applied none evidence based restrictive criteria for bariatric surgery patients with obesity across different ICSs and if accepted should At the centre of this issue are people living with obesity unable to prompt ICSs to ensure local services are commissioned Current waiting access care many of whom have progressive

treatment is shifting from weight loss to patients health and quality of life The objective of this study was to select a core set of patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures to be used in clinical obesity care Materials and Methods The Standardizing Quality of Life in Obesity Treatment III face to face hybrid consensus meeting including people living with obesity as well as healthcare providers was held in Maastricht the Netherlands in It was preceded by two prior multinational consensus meetings and a systematic review Results The meeting was attended by participants representing twelve countries from five continents The participants included healthcare providers such as surgeons endocrinologists dietitians psychologists researchers and people living with obesity most of whom were involved in patient representative networks Three patient reported outcome measures patient reported outcomes were selected the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Lite self esteem measure the BODY Q physical function physical symptoms psychological function social function eating behavior and body image and the Quality of Life for Obesity Surgery questionnaire excess skin No patient reported outcome measure was selected for stigma Conclusion A core set of patient reported outcomes and patient reported outcome measures for measuring quality of life in clinical obesity care is established incorporating patients and experts opinions This set should be used as a minimum for measuring quality of life in routine clinical practice It is essential that individual patient reported outcome measure scores are shared with people living with obesity in order to enhance patient engagement and shared decision making Key points Eight patient reported outcomes PROs were selected for inclusion in the core set The BODY Q IWQOL Lite and QOLOS were selected to measure eight core PROs These PROs and PRO measures represent the outcomes that matter most to patients and experts These outcomes must be considered when measuring treatment effects in obesity treatment Extended author information available on the last page of the article Vol Obesity Surgery Graphical

significantly from those used in registries A number can be used in different cultural and geographical settings Spe of healthcare providers suggested that some PROMs could be cifically these PROMs are available in and languages omitted from the core set and that others contained too many respectively No PROM was selected to measure stigma questions between seven and ten per PRO By omitting these because the available PROMs were considered unsuitable To the PROMs feasibility might be enhanced and less time would best of our knowledge this is the first multinational and multidis be needed to complete the questionnaires According to the ciplinary effort in obesity treatment to achieve the goal of stand participants living with obesity at the meeting omission was ardizing the quality of life outcomes that matter most to patients not necessary They did not consider completing multiple The primary objective of the core set is to improve the quality of questionnaires as burdensome provided their purpose was care in obesity treatment by reflecting outcomes that are most explained and feedback was provided important to patients To this end we incorporated the extensive Using PROMs in clinical practice is increasingly becoming input of people living with obesity throughout the development of routine In the treatment of cancer for example PROMs are the set The core set represents the selection of PROMs that should used to monitor symptoms and quality of life during the pre minimally be used in clinical obesity care operative and postoperative periods Their administration The same PROs and PROMs were selected for the clinical and interpretation led to better identification of posttreatment practice core set as for the research core set which allows the symptoms and problems enhanced clinical decision making same set to be used for different purposes The PROs mostly processes and improved communication between patients and align with the findings of Coulman et al They identified healthcare providers The ability of PROMs to improve out eight themes with regard to living with the outcomes of meta comes in cancer care was further illustrated by Basch et al bolic and bariatric surgery Despite frequent use of the SF They reported that in comparison to usual care digital symp in prior obesity treatment research it was not included in the tom monitoring using PROMs significantly improves physical core set as participants favored other PROMs based on face function symptom control and overall quality of life There is validity In a recent validation study by de Vries et al even evidence that PROMs can improve survival in cancer care the SF was not supported by sufficient validation evidence In obesity treatment PROM data offer a unique oppor in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery due to tunity to enrich consultations by redirecting the focus to those the irrelevance of some questions and lack of relevant items aspects that concern patients most or problems that would oth to patients among other reasons aligning with the cur erwise go undetected Sharing PROM data facilitates active rent findings Recently

Obesity Related Problem Scale high quality care To further aid implementation of the OP scale and Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life PROMs in clinical practice we developed a user manual for the Instrument OWQOL for inclusion The S Q O T consensus core set Appendix Table meetings took a different approach to selecting PROMs by Despite the benefits of PROMs there are challenges regard focusing on their suitability for the selected PRO domains ing their implementation First the participants living with Obesity Surgery obesity indicated that the lack of feedback on PROM scores was only this is unlikely to have biased our results Fourth not all what withheld them most from routinely completing PROMs online participants participated in the entire two day meeting We concluded that PROMs should only be implemented in clin either as a consequence of the different time zones or because of ical practice if the scores are shared with the patients To facili the multiple meetings that were planned prior to the combined tate this process a digital platform is required that automatically congress of the European Association on the Study of Obesity dispatches PROMs before consultations and

Determining a MCID for the globally Ideally this set of PROs and PROMs should be comple QOLOS will also be necessary mented by a set of clinical outcomes that form a core outcome set The key strength of our study was that we involved a geo for obesity treatment graphically diverse panel of healthcare providers from different disciplines as well as participants living with obesity most of whom were

impact of a healthy weight body mass index BMI at disease Accepted April presentation is not known This study aimed to evaluate the visual and headache outcomes stratified by the presenting BMI This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study IIH Life based KEYWORDS on a tertiary neuro ophthalmology IIH service University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust United Pseudotumor cerebri vision Kingdom recruiting consecutive patients living with IIH between and Those with headache prognosis weight a presenting BMI were included The outcome measures included visual outcomes of LogMAR OCT imaging papilloedema visual acuity Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation PMD optical coherence tomo graphy OCT measurements and headache outcomes of frequency severity and Headache Impact Test score Three hundred seventy five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI About of the entire cohort had a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and BMI kg m The baseline PMD was worse in patients without obesity however OCT papilloe dema measures were similar The presence of obesity was associated with a small but significant greater worsening in visual acuity but slower macular ganglion cell layer loss There was no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis related to baseline obesity The headache outcomes showed heterogeneity with worse baseline headache frequency in patients with obesity No BMI group was associated with worse headache outcomes Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patients BMI at presentation does not appear to influence long term visual or headache outcomes Introduction kg m which is reduced to kg m in some ethnic groups due to increased cardiometabolic Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH pre risk at a lower BMI dominantly affects reproductive aged females The adiposity associated with IIH is with obesity IIH is a disease of raised intra centripetal and is correlated with lumbar cranial pressure which can lead to chronic puncture opening pressure A two fold headaches visual loss and cognitive increase in cardiovascular disease risk has been dysfunction Atypical IIH is a term given to

presenta that baseline BMI did not impact the trajectory of tion is uncommon The visual outcomes are similar visual or headache outcomes while for some this between BMI groups however the improvement in could be reassuring it is important to actively man papilloedema was observed to be more rapid in age those who do not have obesity patients without obesity The headache frequency The only current disease modifying therapy for was higher in IIH patients with obesity as compared the systemic manifestations of IIH is weight to those without and over time the headache out loss Its role in patients with a normal base comes were similar between BMI groups line BMI is not yet understood This would be The prevalence of a healthy weight BMI in this a useful future analysis as a recent analysis of IIH study is similar to a previous large study of IIH In Life database found that a change in BMI was this cohort those with a healthy weight BMI includ a prognostic marker for visual outcomes In other ing those without obesity had worse visual field scenarios such as pregnancy the role of weight loss function at baseline despite similar OCT papilloe is not clear dema measures This could potentially reflect a delay Although the outcomes based on BMI are similar in diagnosis due to a lower suspicion of IIH in for people living with IIH it should not be con a person with a healthy weight BMI The OCT cluded that the underlying pathogenesis is the same imaging measures have been shown to be a more IIH has been shown to be associated with hypertes acute marker of disease activity as well as a better tosteronism independent of obesity with meta correlation to intracranial pressure than clinical bolic priming towards lipogenesis In people symptoms Thus the comparable OCT mea with obesity significant weight loss of body sures with worse PMD may indicate a delayed pre weight is often required for disease remission sentation of the disease The trend seen in CSF Potential pathogenesis in lean IIH could be inferred diversion surgery rates may reflect that patients from the phenotypically similar condition of poly with a higher BMI are more likely to present in cystic ovarian syndrome PCOS In PCOS one fulminant IIH and thus require surgery although study reported that of the patients had this requires further evaluation in other cohorts as a healthy weight BMI defined as BMI kg was not statistically significant in this cohort m with a significantly lower prevalence in lean A statistically significant difference was seen in the PCOS of deranged lipid profiles impaired glucose visual acuity and macular ganglion cell layer volume tolerance test and insulin resistance The treat trajectories between those with obesity and those ment for insulin resistance with metformin has been without Table However the clinical significance shown to lessen hyperandrogenism in PCOS and is uncertain due to the small magnitude of this has also been shown to potentially be of benefit in variation which is likely not be perceivable by the IIH A limitation of the IIH life database is that patient or of clinical significance metformin use is not routinely documented and The trajectories of the headache outcomes were therefore no further analysis could be done In not significantly different between kg m and IIH with a normal baseline BMI there may be kg m This is consistent in that baseline BMI a role for dietary modifications and pharmacother potentially and has a greater influence on visual apy to avoid future weight gain as this has been outcomes

undertake an up to date review of the current literature to formulate practical and evidence based guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PBH to recommend future avenues for research in this condition Method A scoping review was undertaken after an extensive literature search A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendations was reached by the steering group authors prior to review by key stakeholders Outcome We make pragmatic recommendations for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH including criteria for diagnosis and recognition as well as recommendations for research areas that should be explored Plain English summary Post bariatric hypoglycaemia PBH is a condition that commonly affects people who have undergone weight loss surgery In this condition people develop low blood sugar occurring about h after meals leading to debilitating symptoms such as hunger sweating anxiety palpitations and even blackouts and fainting PBH is becoming more common as weight loss surgery is being taken up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes The condition often develops after the patient has been discharged from follow up after their surgery which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non specialist healthcare centres The lack of clear information and evidence in the existing scientific literature further contributes to the variation in care To address this problem the Society for Endocrinology has created new guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage this condition The guidelines were developed with input from dietitians surgeons and doctors specialising in weight loss and hormone specialists Keywords obesity bariatric surgery post bariatric hypoglycaemia late dumping Introduction Bariatric surgery such as Roux en Y gastric bypass As a result it is important to identify diagnose and gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy carries adequately treat PBH in people who have undergone significant metabolic benefits including weight loss bariatric surgery diabetes remission and reduction of macrovascular and microvascular events As a result of this clinical Aims and objectives evidence bariatric surgery is more often considered as an option for the treatment of obesity and diabetes The aim of this guideline is to improve and standardise as well as for other metabolic complications such clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of as non alcoholic fatty liver disease Given the PBH To this end our objectives were to undertake an increasing prevalence of bariatric surgery clinicians are up to date review of the current literature formulate increasingly encountering complications of surgery practical and evidence based guidance regarding the One such complication is post bariatric hypoglycaemia diagnosis and treatment of PBH and recommend PBH PBH is usually defined as post prandial future avenues for research in this

identify the relevant literature The which occurs within minutes of food ingestion initial working group contributed to search terms with Early dumping is characterised by a combination of the search

submission for publication Further diagnostic methods criteria see below It is estimated information and clarification were added with the to be between and based on continuous glucose assistance of BK TT and CBL after peer review monitoring studies following provocative tests and using hypoglycaemia related events Registry based studies report a far lower prevalence of Pathophysiology of PBH following bariatric surgery The exact pathophysiology of PBH is unknown but the dynamic interaction of food absorption incretin and Risk factors for PBH insulin secretion is thought to play a role Following most types of bariatric surgery with the exception of Currently there are contrasting reports regarding the gastric banding there is a rapid transit of nutrients to risk factors for PBH Some observational studies have the jejunum and the ileum with absorption and a rapid suggested that people who develop PBH are non diabetic peak of glucose which provokes insulin secretion The pre operatively and have lower pre operative HbA c This exposure of L cells in the distal jejunum and proximal phenomenon is possibly related to higher pre operative ileum to these nutrients also provokes the secretion \u03b2 cell function insulin secretion and sensitivity of GLP and other incretins which amplify the Indeed the presence of pre operative hypoglycaemia hyperglycaemia dependent secretion of insulin and during an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT is associated the insulin dependent disposal of glucose A leading with PBH Other possible risk factors are younger theory is that some people

these differential diagnoses is outside the scope of this gastric bypass SAGB also known as one anastomosis or guidance but internationally accepted guidance for mini gastric bypass has not been studied systematically this is available PBH should also be distinguished with conflicting data Two surgical series reported no from idiopathic postprandial syndrome which is the hypoglycaemia whereas

Table and pasireotide appear to be effective at preventing hypoglycaemia following OGTT or MMT IM long acting pasireotide is also effective although Somatostatin analogues SC pasireotide three times a day may be more effective than long acting IM pasireotide With regard to Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide lanreotide lanreotide there is no published experience on this and pasireotide have been used in individuals with medication for PBH although the experience with this dumping syndrome following upper gastrointestinal analogue in dumping syndrome suggested no difference surgery such as gastrectomy and peptic ulcer surgery in late dumping symptom scores for many years They have been found to be effective for both for early and late dumping syndromes with In summary there is evidence to suggest that short acting late dumping syndrome being the analogous condition SC octreotide and pasireotide can prevent PBH when to PBH in individuals undergoing upper GI surgery such given three times a day with meals Recommendation as oesophagectomy or gastrectomy Table IM pasireotide LAR is also effective These are thought to work by activating somatostatin Recommendation Table However less evidence receptors particularly subtypes and and inhibiting for efficacy exists for other long acting preparations and the release of various gut and metabolic hormones these are not presently recommended Recommendation such as gastrin pancreatic polypeptide glucagon Table neurotensin secretin GLP and insulin all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dumping syndrome There are relative differences in activity SGLT inhibitors between the presently available somatostatin analogues In humans the sodium glucose linked transporters octreotide lanreotide and pasireotide Both octreotide SGLT and SGLT play an important role in sodium and and lanreotide exhibit greater activity at subtype than glucose transport across the basal brush membrane of subtype whereas pasireotide activates both subtypes gut and kidney cells SGLT is expressed in the enterocyte and The more marked hyperglycaemic effect from and in enteroendocrine cells L cells and K cells which pasireotide relative to octreotide in non bariatric respectively produce the incretins GLP and GIP surgery individuals is due to the relative ratio of SGLT is responsible for glucose absorption in the small subtype activation Both pasireotide and octreotide intestine and for the reabsorption of approximately are able to suppress insulin secretion but pasireotide is of the filtered glucose load in segment of the less able to suppress glucagon secretion than octreotide renal proximal tubule SGLT is primarily expressed explained by the fact that inhibition of insulin secretion in the kidney and is responsible for the reabsorption in human pancreatic islets is mediated by subtypes of approximately of the filtered glucose load in the and while inhibition of glucagon secretion is

SGLT use of SGLT inhibitors for PBH Recommendation Canagliflozin when given to individuals who had Table undergone RYGB led to a delay in glucose absorption and reduced peak glucose in response to a g OGTT There was no significant reduction in nadir glucose albeit there was no evidence of PBH in this group Other treatments This was accompanied by a reduction in peak GLP Diazoxide is a potassium

advice professionals HCPs are well placed to participate in semi structured discuss child excess weight with parents and HCP knowledge and skills for interviews SNs from a community and support them to make changes example enhancing HCPs general healthcare NHS trust were recruited to However HCPs have concerns about and weight management related participate in focus groups Vignettes addressing this issue There is a need to were used to stimulate discussion skills and knowledge of child weight understand the factors that influence Data were analysed guided by the management services HCPs in initiating these conversations to Framework approach Conclusion inform strategies to support them Results A range of barriers exist to HCPs Aim Thirteen GPs seven PNs and SNs addressing child excess weight To explore with HCPs working participated The following three with parents in primary care and in primary care and community themes were identified regarding community settings Actions to effect settings their experiences of having barriers to HCPs having conversations structural changes and support HCPs conversations about child weight with about child excess weight structural in developing relevant knowledge and parents and the factors that create and organisational HCP related and skills are required to overcome these barriers or facilitate them to have these parent or

working research school nursing Introduction the support of other agencies There has and years Currently these been less research that more directly data cannot be routinely accessed in There has been increasing focus on the informs the strategies and a lack of primary care but there is an aspiration role of GPs and other primary care and guidance on the support required to to provide this access in the future community healthcare professionals facilitate HCPs in having conversations communication from Public Health HCPs in health promotion including about child weight with parents In a

Digital Child factors that HCPs found helpful when about initiating conversations with Health programme which could assist discussing child weight were identified parents about their child s weight Two in supporting HCPs to have conversations These factors mainly related to systematic reviews of qualitative studies about child weight approaches to interacting with families conducted with HCPs in high income and tools to assess child weight countries reported barriers to HCPs This study explored GPs primary having these conversations including In England there is a programme of care nurses PNs

The use of BMI centiles by HCPs to feel confident in raising the issue and this the child is a little overweight or not but assess overweight was identified as an was sometimes related to the HCP

and parental separation may the limited training that the HCPs receive making dedicated appointments to make them more reluctant to address on childhood obesity and nutrition which discuss child excess weight There was a child overweight contributed to reluctance to initiate sense that this also gave parents time to conversations about child weight prepare for the conversation I think it s quite difficult to talk about weight when they ve the family got so And I think it s a problem that lots of It discussion about child weight requires people would like to tackle but they just much going on SN FG discussing more than the extra thirty seconds I have don t really know where to start we vignette at the end of the ten minute consultation don t have much in the way of training Sometimes I will get over that by saying SNs particularly saw the feedback letter about childhood nutrition GP I think we need to discuss your child s that parents of children with overweight general health please book a separate Parent or family related HCPs and or obesity receive following NCMP appointment to do that GP identified that parents often do not measurement as an issue The SNs had

following receipt of the feedback a barrier In some cases HCPs discussed to the integration of data systems letter and discussed that the wording this in the context of ethnic and cultural to enable HCPs to access and share was problematic often causing anger and factors health information and measurements distress for children with other healthcare I think in this population the issue is that I

rapidly gaining weight interviewing and to providing child she actually didn t know how to cook the weight management and healthy eating it s all this collaborative working isn t it dinners and yeah we spent a lot of time advice Many participants felt that more It ll stop doing the work twice and also with her giving her worksheets how to cook training on providing this advice would it s about being on the same page as well make potato and beans rather than going to help them address child weight Some because a parent may come to us and say the fish and chip shop SN FG also commented on the need to consider I don t know what the problem is and we different cultural contexts when providing it s kind of addressing it in the sense of can say Well actually let s have a look at healthy eating

actually believe as well is sharing advice for families would assist them in GP discussing vignette the experiences as well like you say I did opportunistically addressing child excess this with that one SN FG weight if you want it done GPs to have conversations with parents about child I think an information package to be able Discussion excess weight you have to attach to give to a parent would be great I some kind of incentive for all GPs to take think from a healthcare professional point Summary it seriously unfortunately But at the of view is to give them something to put same time I think there runs the risk of it GPs PNs and SNs recognised the in their hands that they will sit and look at becoming a tick box exercise to get that importance of having conversations when they ve got five minutes PN payment GP with parents about child excess weight but they experienced several barriers HCP knowledge and skills The need HCP approaches HCPs identified While some related to

training on primary and community care The study available to them if you know what the giving this advice would further facilitate has provided valuable new insights on services are that are out there then it makes them having these conversations see facilitating factors for HCPs particularly the conversation a lot easier GP HCP knowledge and skills Many HCPs around structural aspects of health care recognised the need to involve the whole and supporting the development of HCPs When asked about skills and training family when providing this advice knowledge and skills as previous research participants identified generic HCP has focused on facilitators relating to I would relate it to the problem that they skills that were helpful to them in HCP parent interactions presented

address discussions inadequate time fear of weight in primary school aged children undermining parental trust lack of interpreters and financial incentivisation were included Participants serving recognition of overweight and cultural However the need for a more joined up socioeconomically disadvantaged and perceptions of weight by parents approach across healthcare organisations ethnically

gastroplasty ESG is a minimally invasive procedure that has been demonstrated in the MERIT randomised controlled trial to result in substantial and durable additional weight loss in adults with obesity compared with lifestyle fi fi modi cation LM alone We sought to conduct the rst cost effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with class II obesity BMI kg m from a national healthcare system perspective in England based on results from this study METHODS A state Markov model was developed comprising BMI based health states and an absorbing death state Baseline characteristics utilities and transition probabilities were informed by patient level data from the subset of patients with class II obesity in MERIT Adverse events AEs were based on the MERIT safety population Mortality was estimated by applying BMI fi speci c hazard ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from the literature disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I III obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data Disutility due to AEs and the prevalence of obesity related comorbidities were based on the literature Costs included intervention costs AE costs and comorbidity costs RESULTS ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an increase in quality adjusted life years QALYs The incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER for ESG vs LM alone was QALY gained ESG was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses with no ICER estimate exceeding QALY gained In probabilistic sensitivity analysis the mean ICER was QALY gained and ESG remained cost effective in of iterations at a willingness to pay threshold of QALY CONCLUSION Our study indicates that ESG is highly cost effective versus LM alone for the treatment of adults with class II obesity in England International Journal of Obesity

Handling Editor Statement Submitted and externally peer reviewed The handling editor was Associate Editor Rebecca Burch MD Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Abstract Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH is associated with obesity however there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss reduction in intracranial pressure benefit to visual and headache outcomes quality of life and mental health Methods A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO CRD MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant th literature published from inception until December Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN methodology Results A total of studies were included Bariatric surgery resulted in kg weight loss at months Level to Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between to kg weight loss Level to Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP cm H O at months Level followed by multi component lifestyle intervention acetazolamide cm H O at months Level and then a very low energy diet intervention cm H O at months Level The least ICP reduction was shown at months after completing a month multi component lifestyle intervention cm H O Level Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP Level to Discussion Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a BMI kg m since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management Grade A A multi component lifestyle intervention diet physical activity behaviour had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI kg m Grade B Longer term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required to determine if there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH is characterized by raised intracranial pressure ICP pulse synchronous tinnitus headaches and papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss Most people living with IIH are also living with obesity Population studies have observed the increased incidence of IIH in those with an increased body mass index BMI and an elevated BMI is shown to be directly associated with greater risk of a diagnosis of IIH Furthermore a relationship between BMI and visual outcomes has been established A study found patients with BMI kg m were more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro ophthalmology visit and every kg m increase in BMI increased the odds of severe visual loss by times IIH is emerging from being a disease of the neuro ophthalmic axis to being a distinct metabolic disease where the underlying pathophysiology may be modified by weight loss Moreover IIH has been demonstrated to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promotes further weight gain At the same time psychiatric disorders are sevenfold more common in people with IIH compared to the general population which may result from common biological pathways related to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal cortex HPA axis dysfunction which may mean weight management is more challenging for people living with IIH Obesity results from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factors and there is a strong genetic component underlying interindividual variation in body weight As a result the human body is biologically hard wired to prevent weight loss This is a challenge for the treatment of IIH since excess body weight has an impact on IIH development and improvement Moderate weight gain of is associated with a greater risk of developing IIH among both people with and without obesity Meanwhile weight loss in the range of has been reported to lead to remission and weight re gain has been found to be a risk factor for disease recurrence Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Sustained weight loss therefore is essential for long term remission of the disease However clinical practice is varied in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategies for IIH Indeed sustained weight loss has been demonstrated to be essential for long term remission of the disease The optimal weight loss method for IIH is yet to be determined especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity Hence the aim of this study was to identify evaluate and summarise the relevant published studies relating to weight loss interventions for IIH in terms of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcomes such as vision and headache A second aim of the study was to convene a panel of experts in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice points to help guide clinicians who may not have formal training in weight management Methods This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identifier CRD and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses PRISMA guidelines Search strategy th The databases MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception up to December via EBSCO using a comprehensive search strategy eAppendix which was tested and refined to maximise sensitivity for retrieving relevant studies There were no language restrictions The Boolean operator OR was used to separate each term within each concept and each concept was concatenated by the operator AND When possible Medical Subject Heading MeSH terms were used to expand the search language The search strategy was identical in both databases with minor adaptation to the coding to suit Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology individual database settings References were imported into Covidence software for de duplication and screening Inclusion and exclusion criteria For studies to be included the study population criteria were aged years old diagnosed with IIH and with a baseline BMI kg m Studies were included if a weight management intervention was provided and weight change between pre and post intervention was reported Reviews expert opinions case reports and conference proceedings were excluded Papers selection and data extraction Two reviewers SA and SPM independently and in duplicate screened titles and abstracts and then screened full text reports for all identified studies Reviewers were masked to each other s responses until each screening stage was complete utilising Covidence Disagreement was resolved by consensus between reviewers Data extraction Study characteristics were documented and the criteria to which the participants were diagnosed with IIH were recorded The primary outcome of interest in this systematic review was weight change measured either by absolute weight kg or excess weight calculated by absolute weight loss baseline weight ideal body weight x or absolute BMI kg m change The secondary outcomes were changes in ICP visual and headache outcomes and self reported quality of life measures e g Short Form SF Health Survey Specifically for visual outcomes we documented visual acuity visual field type and output papilloedema and whether it was subjectively graded or quantified by optic coherence tomography OCT imaging Headache outcomes included headache symptoms headache phenotype assessment type Headache impact test HIT headache frequency Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology severity score and analgesic usage Data were extracted by one reviewer SA SPM FCh and peer reviewed by the another SA SPM FCh using an electronic data extraction form Data analysis Since the included studies were diverse heterogeneity between studies in terms of the interventions duration of follow up and method of outcome measurement precluded pooling of results with meta analysis Instead a narrative synthesis approach was employed to synthesise the findings from included studies Quality of evidence The quality and risk of bias of the included studies was assessed at the study level and each study was assigned an evidence level for the weight loss ICP headache and visual outcomes based on Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN methodology eAppendix by two independent reviewers SA and SPM Practice recommendations The process of SIGN methodology eAppendix was followed to formulate evidence based clinical recommendations A multi disciplinary recommendation panel was formed of relevant professional groups with experience and expertise in IIH and weight management The recommendation panel included a dietitian SA clinical psychologist FCa endocrinologist AAT bariatric surgeons DJP CP neurologists AJS FCh neuro ophthalmologists SPM SW and a patient representative AD The expert panel convened to discuss the evidence base identified from the systematic review and formulate draft recommendations The draft recommendations together with their grading were circulated within the guideline group in an iterative process until consensus was achieved Where an evidence base was lacking Good Practice Points GPP were formulated to provide clinicians with short pieces of advice that the recommendation panel deemed were essential to good clinical practice Copyright The

with IIH based upon the evidence identified within the systematic review and graded according to the quality of available evidence Where evidence was not available for IIH populations GPP were formulated based upon evidence extrapolated from obesity literature The graded recommendations are shown in Table Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Discussion The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people living with IIH is not only because weight loss reduces ICP but also that it reduces mortality and reduces the burden of prevalent and incident obesity related complications Weight loss is recognised as a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH This study sought to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH which was identified as research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership The panel made graded recommendations based upon the evidence identified by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in good practice points from the obesity literature Table While there was one RCT demonstrating Level evidence for the directed use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to months and one cross over study Level utilising a VLED for months which demonstrated efficacy in terms of ICP visual and headache outcomes these two studies have not been replicated The results of this analysis therefore demonstrated the shortage of high quality evidence as there were no studies that could be directly compared due to different weight management methods being used and a lack of standardised outcome measures Sustained long term weight loss should be considered as a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patients with IIH Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counselled sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH They should have their weight measured and BMI calculated to assess the weight management options and monitor the intervention efficacy Although there are no RCTs that evaluated the measurement of overweight and obesity compared to not measuring these outcomes the panel agreed that this aspect of IIH patient care was essential The degree of weight loss required for IIH symptom improvement was less clear as studies reported amount of weight lost with a variety of outcome measures There were no studies Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology evaluating the time where the minimum amount of weight lost was correlated with the point of disease remission There was Level evidence that demonstrated a reduction of weight between was required to achieve disease remission In the VLED cross over study of body weight loss was correlated with reduction in ICP resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcomes and the IIHWT disease remission was defined as ICP to return to normal levels at cmH It is therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle interventions delivered in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss required to induce remission of IIH The panel considered this evidence and recommended the target weight loss should be for IIH disease remission However the panel acknowledged that this goal is unlikely to be achieved via a lifestyle intervention alone and a realistic goal may be weight loss which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptoms There were no studies evaluating solely physical activity interventions in IIH Physical activity could be recommended as part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss Behaviour therapy has been shown to be a useful adjunct when incorporated into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance Licensed anti obesity medications AOMs did not feature in this study as there were no studies with primary aims of using pharmacotherapy for weight loss in IIH It was noteworthy that there was inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide and topiramate and to a lesser extent zonisamide are used to manage IIH and have previously been clinical observed to reduce weight The method by which acetazolamide causes weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia a salty rancid or metallic taste sensation that persists in the mouth nausea dyspepsia vomiting and diarrhoea Acetazolamide is not well tolerated in this patient group with up to of people discontinuing the medicine In our systematic review it was interesting to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and ICP at months following the directed use of acetazolamide Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Bariatric surgery had the greatest sustained weight loss up to months Clinicians managing IIH may be reluctant to refer patients for bariatric surgery due to funding access and misconceptions regarding the safety of bariatric surgery such as operative mortality excess skin and nutritional optic atrophy Physicians may be concerned about CSF shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery however bariatric surgery has been shown to be safer and more cost effective than CSF shunting Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedures were superior to gastric banding in terms of weight loss and ICP reduction in people with IIH For obesity gastric bypass has been found to be the most clinically effective and most cost effective intervention compared to other weight management programmes and has the highest quality adjusted life year QALY gains Superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in IIH may be explained by the enhanced postprandial glucagon like peptide GLP secretion as emerging data found that exogenously administered GLP significantly reduces ICP without weight loss Another key consideration when understanding the impact of an intervention is the natural history of the disease including disease duration This could have an impact on outcomes for example in people who have had the disease for many years it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that has occurred due to axonal loss and hence why in studies with long disease duration the visual field measures may not improve Likewise papilloedema may acutely be present and without intervention may regress to the mean Strengths of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review which was prospectively registered on PROSPERO and all screening data extraction and quality assessment was blinded and conducted by two reviewers The evidence was translated into clinical recommendations which were made by multi disciplinary experts in obesity and IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology hence supporting the translation of the research for clinical application There are certain limitations to the study The included studies all used different outcome measures and a variety of weight loss methods This meant a meta analysis was not able to be performed due to study heterogeneity This heterogeneity in IIH studies evaluating weight loss methods needs to be considered when planning future clinical trials in IIH We also only included published studies which means there was potential for publication bias As meta analysis was precluded it was not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias using funnel plot The study populations of our included studies were predominately female a reflection of IIH being less prevalent in males however the findings are therefore not generalisable to males Specifically there is a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in IIH in a male population and for both genders at a lower BMI of kg m None of the studies included women who were pregnant which is an area in need of evaluating as it has been recommended that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input Most of the studies were of short duration with only one study reporting outcomes longitudinally at years The longer the reporting period the more missing data occurred However future studies should be encouraged to include long term outcomes to determine cost effectiveness and intervention durability People with IIH who have obesity compared to healthy weight have significantly lower health related quality of life scores Moreover obesity and weight gain have been found to be independent predictors of poorer mental health related quality of life Psychiatric symptoms in association with IIH are usually poorly described and underestimated in the literature but the prevalence is reported to be as high as Given that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patients engagement and adherence to weight management interventions and indeed IIH treatments this requires investigation Hence future studies should collect quality of life and Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology psychiatric outcome measures to evaluate the influence of weight management interventions and include long term outcome data collection to assess durability of the intervention Conclusions We advocate for obesity to be viewed as a chronic disease with complex contributory associations and prognostic implications to IIH rather than merely a risk factor Weight loss should be seen as an important tool in the management of IIH The biological drivers of obesity may explain why short term weight management interventions are often insufficient for long term disease remission The hierarchy of effect in weight loss methods seem to be analogous to the reduction of ICP with bariatric surgery having the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the IIH population However not all patients will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention In such case multi component lifestyle interventions should be provided but it should be acknowledged that weight loss is likely to be modest and IIH disease remission is therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in IIH symptoms WNL eapp http links lww com WNL D WNL eapp http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D WNL etab http links lww com WNL D
