Thirteen report use criterion that be not compliant with NICE guidance . A large area of the country centre around the East of England do not have a bariatric unit reduce access to care . There be signifi- cant geographical variation in the availability of both bariatric and specialist medical weight management service across England , with large portion of the country with- out local access to a service or no service at all .

The outcome measure include visual outcome of LogMAR OCT imaging ; papilloedema visual acuity , Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation ( PMD ) , optical coherence tomo- graphy ( OCT ) measurement , and headache outcome of frequency , severity , and Headache Impact Test- score . Three hundred seventy-five people with IIH and a documented baseline BMI . About . % of the entire cohort have a healthy weight BMI at IIH presentation and . % BMI < kg\/m . The baseline PMD be worse in patient without obesity ; however , OCT papilloe- dema measure be similar . The presence of obesity be associate with a small but significant great worsen in visual acuity but slow macular ganglion cell layer loss . There be no impact on PMD or papilloedema prognosis relate to baseline obesity . The headache outcomes show heterogeneity , with bad baseline headache frequency in patient with obesity . No BMI group be associate with bad headache outcome . Patients with a healthy weight BMI or those without obesity at baseline make up a small proportion of IIH patient .

Endocrine Connections ( ) e Aim : The overall aim be to improve and standardise clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of PBH . The objective be : ( ) to undertake an up-to-date review of the current literature ; ( ) to formulate practical and evidence- base guidance regard the diagnosis and treatment of PBH ; ( ) to recommend future avenue for research in this condition . Method : A scoping review be undertake after an extensive literature search . A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendation be reach by the steer group author prior to review by key stakeholder . Outcome : We make pragmatic recommendation for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH , include criterion for diagnosis and recognition , as well a recommendation for research area that should be explore . Plain English summary Post-bariatric hypoglycaemia ( PBH ) be a condition that commonly affect people who have undergone weight loss surgery . In this condition , people develop low blood sugar occur about \u2013 h after meal , lead to debilitate symptom such a hunger , sweating , anxiety , palpitation and even blackout and fainting . PBH be become more common a weight loss surgery be be take up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes . The condition often develop after the patient have be discharge from follow-up after their surgery , which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non-specialist healthcare centre . The lack of clear information and evidence in the exist scientific literature far contributes to the variation in care . To address this problem , the Society for Endocrinology have create new guideline to help healthcare professional accurately diagnose and manage this condition . The guideline be develop with input from dietitian , surgeon and doctor specialise in weight loss , and hormone specialist . Keywords : obesity ; bariatric surgery ; post-bariatric hypoglycaemia ; late dumping Introduction Bariatric surgery , such a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass , ( ) . As a result , it be important to identify , diagnose , and gastric banding , or sleeve gastrectomy , carry adequately treat PBH in people who have undergone significant metabolic benefit , include weight loss , bariatric surgery . diabetes remission , and reduction of macrovascular and microvascular event . As a result of this clinical Aims and objective evidence , bariatric surgery be more often consider a an option for the treatment of obesity and diabetes , The aim of this guideline be to improve and standardise as well a for other metabolic complication such clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( ) . Given the PBH . To this end , our objective be to : ( ) undertake an increase prevalence of bariatric surgery , clinician be up-to-date review of the current literature ; ( ) formulate increasingly encounter complication of surgery ( ) . practical and evidence-based guidance regard the One such complication be post-bariatric hypoglycaemia diagnosis and treatment of PBH and ( ) recommend ( PBH ) ( ) .

People with PBH should also be screen and treat for nutritional deficiency accord to accept High guidance . . Dietary advice for PBH should include eat controlled portion of carbohydrate , together with Moderate reinforcement of the post-bariatric eating strategy . Suggested strategy include : - Small and frequent meal ( up to \u00d7 per day ) . - Reduced carbohydrate content ( start at < g\/meal ) . - Emphasis on choose low GI over high GI carbohydrate . - Consideration may be give to lower carbohydrate target ( e.g . g\/meal , g\/meal and so on ) under supervision if the initial g\/meal target be not effective . . We do not recommend modify the type of carbohydrate ( e.g . fructose-containing food ) , use Low cornstarch supplement , or use food additive to modify glycaemic index . . CGM , where available or fund , may be consider a a tool for education , reinforce and document Low the relationship between dietary change to the amelioration of PBH , improve the adherence to dietary advice and for early recognition and treatment of hypo . . People with PBH should be taught procedure to treat emergent hypoglycaemia . A suggested approach Low be a follow : - They should be advise to always carry fast act carbohydrate to treat hypoglycaemia . - Upon receive a warning or confirmation of hypoglycaemia , they should be advise to consume small amount of fast act carbohydrate ( e.g . \u2013 g of dextrose ) . - They should be advise to test blood glucose min after consumption to confirm resolution of the hypoglycaemia . If necessary , a far small dose of carbohydrate can be use if the blood glucose be still low . - A follow-on low GI carbohydrate-containing snack may be consider after initial resolution of the hypoglycaemia . . Sucrose for treatment of hypoglycaemia should be avoid in acarbose-treated PBH . High . People should be encourage to exercise after bariatric surgery . A suggested approach to exercise in PBH Low be a follow : - They should be advise to take exercise when the risk of PBH be low ( e.g . when fast or at least hr after meal ) . - They should be advise to avoid carbohydrate load prior to exercise . - They should be advise to measure their blood glucose when feeling unwell . - They should be advise to carry some fast-acting carbohydrate that can be use to manage any hypoglycaemia . - A follow-on low GI carbohydrate-containing snack may be consider after exercise . .

Preprint Abstract Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) be associate with obesity , however there be a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH . The aim of this systematic review be to evaluate weight loss intervention in people with IIH to determine which intervention be superior in term of weight loss , reduction in intracranial pressure , benefit to visual and headache outcome , quality of life , and mental health . Methods A systematic review be carry out in accordance with PRISMA guideline and register with PROSPERO ( CRD ) . MEDLINE and CINAHL be search for relevant th literature publish from inception until December . Screening and quality appraisal be conduct by two independent reviewer . Recommendations be grade use Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) methodology . Results A total of study be include . Bariatric surgery result in . - . kg weight loss at month ( Level - to ++ ) . Lifestyle weight management intervention result in between . to . kg weight loss ( Level + to ++ ) . Bariatric surgery result in the great mean reduction in ICP ( - . cm H O ) at month ( Level ++ ) , follow by multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide ( - . cm H O ) at month ( Level + ) , and then a very low energy diet intervention ( - . cm H O ) at month ( Level ++ ) . The least ICP reduction be show at month after complete a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention ( - . cm H O ) ( Level ++ ) . Reduction in body weight be show to be highly correlate with reduction in ICP ( Level ++ to ++ ) . Discussion Bariatric surgery should be consider for woman with IIH and a BMI \u2265 kg\/m since this have the most robust evidence for sustained weight management ( Grade A ) . A multi- component lifestyle intervention ( diet + physical activity + behaviour ) have the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI < kg\/m ( Grade B ) . Longer term outcome for weight management intervention in people with IIH be require , to determine if there be a superior weight loss intervention for IIH . Copyright Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) be characterize by raise intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , pulse-synchronous tinnitus , headache and papilloedema , with the potential risk of permanent visual loss . Most people live with IIH be also live with obesity . Population study have observe the increased incidence of IIH in those with an increase body mass index ( BMI ) , and an elevated BMI be show to be directly associate with great risk of a diagnosis of IIH . Furthermore , a relationship between BMI and visual outcome have be establish . A study find patient with BMI > kg\/m be more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro-ophthalmology visit and every kg\/m increase in BMI increase the odds of severe visual loss by . time . IIH be emerge from be a disease of the neuro-ophthalmic axis to be a distinct \u2013 metabolic disease , where the underlying pathophysiology may be modify by weight loss . Moreover , IIH have be demonstrate to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promote further weight gain . At the same time , psychiatric disorder be sevenfold more common in people with IIH compare to the general population , which may result from common biological pathway relate to hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex ( HPA ) -axis dysfunction , which may mean weight management be more challenging for people live with IIH . Obesity result from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factor , and there be a strong genetic component underlie interindividual variation in body weight . As , a result , the human body be biologically hard-wired to prevent weight loss . This be a challenge for the treatment of IIH since excess body weight have an impact on IIH development and improvement . Moderate weight gain of - % be associate with a great risk of develop IIH among both people with and without obesity . Meanwhile , weight loss \u2013 in the range of - % have be report to lead to remission and weight re-gain have be find to be a risk factor for disease recurrence . Copyright Sustained weight loss therefore be essential for long-term remission of the disease . However , clinical practice be vary in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategy for IIH . Indeed , sustain weight loss have be demonstrate to be essential for long-term remission of the disease . The optimal weight loss method for IIH be yet to be determine , especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity . Hence , the aim of this study be to identify , evaluate , and summarise the relevant publish study relate to weight loss intervention for IIH in term of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcome such a vision and headache . A second aim of the study be to convene a panel of expert in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice point to help guide clinician who may not have formal training in weight management . Methods This systematic review be register on PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( identifier CRD ) and be report in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Search strategy th The database MEDLINE and CINAHL be search from inception up to December via EBSCO use a comprehensive search strategy ( eAppendix ) , which be test and refine to maximise sensitivity for retrieve relevant study . There be no language restriction . The Boolean operator \u201c OR \u201d be use to separate each term within each concept , and each concept be concatenate by the operator \u201c AND \u201d . When possible , Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) term be use to expand the search language . The search strategy be identical in both database , with minor adaptation to the coding to suit Copyright individual database setting . References be import into Covidence software for de- duplication and screening . Inclusion and exclusion criterion For study to be include , the study population criterion be age \u2265 year old , diagnose with IIH and with a baseline BMI \u2265 kg\/m . Studies be include if a weight management intervention be provide and weight change between pre- and post-intervention be report . Reviews , expert opinion , case report and conference proceeding be exclude . Papers selection and data extraction Two reviewer ( SA and SPM ) independently and in duplicate screen title and abstract and then screen full-text report for all identified study . Reviewers be mask to each other \u2019 s response until each screening stage be complete , utilising Covidence . Disagreement be resolve by consensus between reviewer . Data extraction Study characteristic be document and the criterion to which the participant be diagnose with IIH be record . The primary outcome of interest in this systematic review be weight change , measure either by absolute weight ( kg or % ) , excess weight ( % ) ( calculate by absolute weight loss \/ ( baseline weight \u2013 ideal body weight ) x ) or absolute BMI ( kg\/m ) change . The secondary outcome be change in ICP , visual and headache outcome , and self-reported quality of life measure ( e.g. , Short Form ( SF- ) Health Survey ) . Specifically for visual outcome we document visual acuity , visual field type and output , papilloedema and whether it be subjectively grade or quantify by optic coherence tomography ( OCT ) imaging . Headache outcomes include headache symptom , headache phenotype assessment type , Headache impact test ( HIT ) - , headache frequency , Copyright severity score and analgesic usage . Data be extract by one reviewer ( SA\/SPM\/FCh ) and peer review by the another ( SA\/SPM\/FCh ) , use an electronic data extraction form . Data analysis Since the included study be diverse , heterogeneity between study in term of the intervention , duration of follow-up and method of outcome measurement preclude pooling of result with meta-analysis . Instead , a narrative synthesis approach be employ to synthesise the finding from included study . Quality of evidence The quality and risk of bias of the included study be assess at the study level and each study be assign an evidence level for the weight loss , ICP , headache and visual outcome , base on Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) methodology ( eAppendix ) , by two independent reviewer ( SA and SPM ) . Practice recommendations The process of SIGN methodology ( eAppendix ) be follow to formulate evidence- base clinical recommendation . A multi-disciplinary recommendation panel be form of relevant professional group with experience and expertise in IIH and weight management . The recommendation panel include a dietitian ( SA ) , clinical psychologist ( FCa ) , endocrinologist ( AAT ) , bariatric surgeon ( DJP , CP ) , neurologist ( AJS , FCh ) , neuro- ophthalmologist ( SPM , SW ) , and a patient representative ( AD ) . The expert panel convene to discuss the evidence base identify from the systematic review and formulate draft recommendation . The draft recommendation together with their grading be circulate within the guideline group in an iterative process until consensus be achieve . Where an evidence base be lack , Good Practice Points ( GPP ) be formulate to provide clinician with short piece of advice that the recommendation panel deem be essential to good clinical practice . Copyright Results After removal of duplicate , database search yield study . Of these , be exclude base on their title and abstract . Forty-seven publication be then exclude after full text review , due to participant have a BMI < kg\/m ( n= ) , study design ( n= ) , weight change not report ( n= ) and the absence of weight loss intervention ( n= ) . A total , , \u2013 of study be include , of which study be original study and five study , \u2013 be report of included study . The study selection process be summarise in Figure . Study Characteristics , , , \u2013 Study characteristic can be find in Table . There be six study of randomise control trial ( RCTs ) , four of prospective non-randomised interventional , , , , study ; and two prospective and four retrospective observational study , , , , . Prescribed concomitant IIH pharmacotherapy be note in eTable . Participant characteristic There be total of patient include in this review and study generally have small sample size , range from four to participant ( Table ) . Most study ( n= ) include only female in their inclusion criterion . Only seven study include male , , , , \u2013 participant , who be the minority of the study population ( range from . % to . % ) , and no male receive a bariatric surgery intervention . The mean age of participant range between and year old and the mean baseline BMI range between to kg\/m . Participants undergo bariatric surgery also have a high mean BMI ( range . to . kg\/m ) than lifestyle intervention ( . to . kg\/m ) . In the nine , , \u2013 , , \u2013 study that report ethnicity , most participant be white ( range to % ) . , , , , , \u2013 Nine study record or define the IIH disease duration , with a wide range from acute disease within week of diagnosis to establish disease beyond year . Copyright Weight loss intervention Eight study ( n= participant ) report on bariatric surgery intervention , include , , \u2013 , , , , , , gastric band ( n= study ) , sleeve gastrectomy ( n= study ) and , , , , gastric bypass ( n= study ) . Twelve study report on lifestyle weight , , , management intervention ( n= participant ) ; of which four study be dietary , , , \u2013 intervention alone , seven study be multi-component intervention ( diet + physical activity + behavioural intervention ) and in one study patient independently source a weight management intervention of their choosing ( eTable ) . Weight loss outcome In study where outcome be pool across bariatric surgery procedure ( gastric band , gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy ) , mean weight loss be . to . kg at month , ( Level - to ++ ) ( Table ) . However , where weight loss outcome be report at the procedure level , the great weight loss be see for gastric bypass procedure ( n= participant ) with a significant weight reduction of . to . kg at to month and excess weight loss of . to . % at month to a median of month ( Level - to - , , ) . Sleeve gastrectomy ( n= participant ) result in weight loss of . to . kg at , to month ( Level to - ) . Excess weight loss range from . to . % at month , ( Level ) , and . % excess weight loss at a median follow-up of month ( Level - ) ; statistical significance be not report . Weight loss outcome after gastric banding ( n= participant ) vary . In one study , a mean . kg weight gain observed month post-gastric band procedure ( Level - ) . In other study , excess weight loss be . % at a , mean of month and a less . % at a median of month ( Level to - ) ; although statistical significance be not report for either study . At month ( Level - ) , gastric bypass be show to result in the great weight loss ( kg ) compare to both sleeve gastrectomy and gastric band ( p= < . ) at month . At Copyright longitudinal follow-up ( Level - ) , weight loss be great for gastric bypass ( median follow-up month ) compare to gastric banding ( median follow-up month ) ( p= . ) , but there be no difference between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy ( median follow-up month ) ( p= . ) . The great weight loss with a lifestyle intervention be report use a VLED dietary intervention with a . kg at month ( Level + ) . Short-term dietary intervention result , in modest reduction in BMI of . to . kg\/m at to month ( Level - to + ) . At a median of to month follow-up of a dietary intervention , weight loss be not significant however the addition of . g\/day of metformin lead to a mean weight loss of . % and . % in patient with hyperinsulinaemia and PCOS , respectively ( Level + ) . A -month multi- component intervention result in a mean weight loss of . kg and . kg for multi- component intervention only and multi-component intervention + acetazolamide , respectively \u2013 ( Level + ) . A -month multi-component intervention do not result in significant weight , loss at either - or -months follow-up ( Level - to ++ ) . Intracranial pressure outcome While ten study record baseline ICP measure by lumbar puncture opening , , , , , \u2013 , , , pressure ( Table ) , only three study measure change in ICP follow weight management intervention . Bariatric surgery offer the great mean reduction ( - . cm H O ) in ICP at month ( Level ++ ) , follow by a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide ( - . cm H O ) ( Level + ) , and then a -month VLED ( diet only ) intervention ( - . cm H O ) ( Level ++ ) , then a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention ( - . cm H O ) ( Level + ) . The least ICP reduction be show at month after complete a -month multi-component lifestyle intervention ( - . cm H O ) ( Level ++ ) . Reduction in body weight be also show to be highly correlate with reduction in ICP , ( Level ++ to ++ ) . Copyright Visual outcomes , , , , Only five study report the visual acuity ( eTable ) . Five study give brief description of visual field loss but do not detail the type of visual field that be \u2013 , , perform while one study do not report visual field outcome . Six study report the perimetric mean deviation ( PMD ) from the - Humphrey visual field analyser , , , , , ( Level to + ) . Five study comment on the presence or absence of , , , papilloedema ( Level ) , whereas formal Fris\u00e9n grading , and OCT imaging be , , , , , record in six study ( level - to + ) . Only one study note significant improvement in visual acuity , low contrast visual acuity , HVF and OCT measure of papilledema with a % reduction in weight ( level ++ ) . Generally , visual parameter improve over time , however when a direct comparison be make in between group there be no significance find in most study ( eTable ) . In IIHTT there be a modest , but statistically significant , improvement in the visual field MD , in conjunction with a significant difference in the weight loss between those on placebo and multicomponent intervention and those in the acetazolamide and multicomponent intervention arm ( acetazolamide : \u2212 . kg , from . kg to . kg ; placebo : \u2212 . kg , from . kg to . kg ; treatment effect , \u2212 . kg , % CI , \u2212 . to \u2212 . kg ; P < . ) ( Level + ) . A mediation analysis of the primary outcome PMD be perform to determine the degree to which the effect of acetazolamide on PMD be mediate by it effect on weight , but this be find to be not significant ( p= . ) . The IIHTT and IIHWT , RCTs therefore do not find visual parameter that be directly associate with extent of weight loss ( level + to + ) and all the other study report visual outcome do not directly compare change in visual outcome with weight outcome ( level to level ++ ) . Headache outcomes Few study provide detailed headache outcome ( Level ++ to + , eTable ) . Only one study note significant reduction in headache frequency , severity , analgesic use and HIT- Copyright score with VLED also deliver a % reduction in weight at month ( Level ++ ) . In the , two RCTs there be no support evidence of a significant reduction of headache follow weight loss ( Level ++ to + ) . Notably in the IIHTT study there be no correlation between headache burden , a assess by HIT- , and BMI at either baseline or subsequent follow-up at month ( Level + ) . Quality of Life outcome , Only two study report on quality-of-life ; both use the Short Form ( SF- ) Health Survey ( Level ++ ) . After bariatric surgery , there be significant improvement in physical ( p= < . ) but not mental component score at month ( Level ++ ) . Immediately after a -month VLED ( diet alone ) intervention , there be a significant improvement in both the physical ( p= < . ) and mental ( p= . ) component score ( Level + ) . However , this improvement be not sustain at month after the VLED intervention have end . Mental health outcome Only one study report change in self-reported anxiety and depression , assess use the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) . There be no significant change in anxiety in either the multi-component lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery intervention group ; however , there be a significant ( p= . ) reduction in depression score ( - . ; % CI - . to - . ) at month in the bariatric surgery intervention group only ( Level ++ ) . Graded recommendation for clinical practice The expert panel identify consensus-based recommendation for weight management in people with IIH base upon the evidence identify within the systematic review and grade accord to the quality of available evidence . Where evidence be not available for IIH population , GPP be formulate base upon evidence extrapolate from obesity literature . The graded recommendation be show in Table . Copyright Discussion The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people live with IIH be not only because weight loss reduces ICP , but also that it reduce mortality and reduce the burden of prevalent and incident obesity relate complication . Weight loss be recognise a a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH . This study seek to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH , which be identify a research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership . The panel make graded recommendation base upon the evidence identify by this systematic review , and detailed clinical guidance in good practice point from the obesity literature ( Table ) . While there be one RCT demonstrate Level ++ evidence for the direct use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to month , and one cross over study ( Level + ) utilise a VLED for month which demonstrate efficacy in term of ICP , visual and headache outcome , these two study have not be replicate . The result of this analysis therefore demonstrate the shortage of high-quality evidence , a there be no study that could be directly compare due to different weight management method be use , and a lack of standardised outcome measure . Sustained long term weight loss should be consider a a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patient with IIH . Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counsel sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH . They should have their weight measure and BMI calculate to assess the weight management option and monitor the intervention efficacy . Although there be no RCTs that evaluate the measurement of overweight and obesity compare to not measure these outcome , the panel agree that this aspect of IIH patient care be essential . The degree of weight loss require for IIH symptom improvement be less clear a study report amount of weight lose with a variety of outcome measure . There be no study Copyright evaluate the time where the minimum amount of weight lose be correlate with the point of disease remission . There be Level + evidence that demonstrate a reduction of weight between - % be require to achieve disease remission . In the VLED cross over study % of body weight loss be correlate with reduction in ICP , resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcome and the IIHWT disease remission be define a ICP to return to normal level at cmH . It be therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle intervention deliver in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss require to induce remission of IIH . The panel consider this evidence and recommend the target weight loss should be % for IIH disease remission . However , the panel acknowledge that this goal be unlikely to be achieve via a lifestyle intervention alone , and a realistic goal may be - % weight loss , which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptom . There be no study evaluate solely physical activity intervention in IIH . Physical activity could be recommend a part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss . Behaviour therapy have be show to be a useful adjunct when incorporate into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance . Licensed anti-obesity medication ( AOMs ) do not feature in this study , a there be no study with primary aim of use pharmacotherapy for weight loss in IIH . It be noteworthy that there be inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction . Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such a acetazolamide and topiramate , and to a less extent zonisamide , be use to manage IIH and have previously be clinical observe to reduce weight . The method by which acetazolamide cause weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia ( a salty , rancid or metallic taste sensation that persist in the mouth ) , nausea , dyspepsia , vomit and diarrhoea . Acetazolamide be not well tolerate in this patient group with up to % of people discontinue the medicine . In our systematic review , it be interest to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and ICP at month follow the direct use of acetazolamide . Copyright Bariatric surgery have the great sustained weight loss up to month . Clinicians manage IIH may be reluctant to refer patient for bariatric surgery , due to fund access and misconception regard the safety of bariatric surgery , such a operative mortality , excess skin , and nutritional optic atrophy . Physicians may be concern about CSF shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery ; however bariatric surgery have be show to be safe and more cost-effective than CSF shunt . Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedure be superior to gastric banding , in term of weight loss and ICP reduction in people with IIH . For obesity , gastric bypass have be find to be the most clinically effective and most cost-effective intervention compare to other weight management programme and have the high quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) gain . Superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in IIH may be explain by the enhanced postprandial glucagon-like peptide- ( GLP- ) secretion , a emerge data find that exogenously administer GLP- significantly reduce ICP without weight loss . Another key consideration when understand the impact of an intervention be the natural history of the disease include disease duration . This could have an impact on outcome , for example in people who have have the disease for many year it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that have occur due to axonal loss and hence why in study with long disease duration the visual field measure may not improve . Likewise , papilloedema may acutely be present , and without intervention may regress to the mean . Strengths of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review , which be prospectively register on PROSPERO and all screening , data extraction and quality assessment be blind and conduct by two reviewer . The evidence be translate into clinical recommendation which be make by multi-disciplinary expert in obesity and IIH , Copyright hence support the translation of the research for clinical application . There be certain limitation to the study . The included study all use different outcome measure , and a variety of weight loss method . This mean a meta-analysis be not able to be perform , due to study heterogeneity . This heterogeneity in IIH study evaluate weight loss method need to be consider when plan future clinical trial in IIH . We also only include publish study , which mean there be potential for publication bias . As meta- analysis be preclude , it be not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias use funnel plot . The study population of our included study be predominately female , a reflection of IIH be less prevalent in male , however the finding be therefore not generalisable to male . Specifically , there be a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in IIH in a male population , and for both gender at a low BMI of - kg\/m . None of the study include woman who be pregnant , which be an area in need of evaluate , a it have be recommend that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input . Most of the study be of short duration , with only one study report outcome longitudinally at year . The longer the reporting period , the more missing data occur . However , future study should be encourage to include long term outcome , to determine cost-effectiveness and intervention durability . People with IIH who have obesity , compare to healthy weight , have significantly low health-related quality of life score . Moreover , obesity and weight gain have be find to be independent predictor of poor mental health-related quality of life . Psychiatric symptom in association with IIH be usually poorly describe and underestimate in the literature , but the prevalence be report to be as high a % . Given that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patient \u2019 engagement and adherence to weight management intervention , and indeed IIH treatment , this require investigation . Hence , future study should collect quality of life and Copyright psychiatric outcome measure to evaluate the influence of weight management intervention , and include long term outcome data collection , to assess durability of the intervention . Conclusions We advocate for obesity to be view a a chronic disease with complex contributory association and prognostic implication to IIH , rather than merely a risk factor . Weight loss should be see a an important tool in the management of IIH . The biological driver of obesity may explain why short-term weight management intervention be often insufficient for long-term disease remission . The hierarchy of effect in weight loss method seem to be analogous to the reduction of ICP , with bariatric surgery have the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the IIH population . However , not all patient will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention . In such case , multi-component lifestyle intervention should be provide ; but it should be acknowledge that weight loss be likely to be modest and IIH disease remission be therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in IIH symptom .

Repeat measurement should be take to determine long-term weight trajectory and effectiveness of weight management treatment . Obtain a complete drug history . Anti-psychotic medication can cause weight gain GPP and precipitate IIH . Where a temporal relationship be note between weight gain and a causative medicine the clinical team should discuss this with the mental health team and patient . Goal for weight loss and weight maintenance Discuss sensitively with patient that obesity be a complex metabolic disorder and GPP weight management have be show to improve some symptom of IIH and may support IIH disease remission . Discuss with patient that the goal of weight management be to maintain a low GPP body weight over the long term . Counsel patient that obesity be a chronic , relapse disease and therefore total GPP lifelong remission from obesity may not be achievable . Advise patient that weight loss of - % contribute to IIH disease remission , C ( EL + ) however counsel patient this may only be achieve via intervention with bariatric surgery . Advise patient a multi-component lifestyle intervention ( dietary therapy + physical GPP activity + behaviour ) be an alternative treatment that may support a more modest weight loss of up to - % Lifestyle Advise patient that a multi-component intervention ( diet + physical activity + B ( EL ++ to + ) behaviour ) may be effective in the medium-term ( up to month ) for modest weight loss , but weight loss may not be maintain in the longer-term ( > month ) . Advise patient that dietary approach alone that create an energy deficit of - C ( EL + ) , kcals\/day may be effective in the short-term for modest weight loss ( up to month ) . Only recommend very low energy diet ( VLEDs ) of < kcals\/day if the patient will C ( EL + ) have access to intensive dietary support and if the patient present with immediate risk of worsen papilloedema . Pharmacotherapy Acetazolamide in conjunction with a multi-component lifestyle intervention may B ( EL + ) support weight management , however this may be due side-effects of the medication which can cause dysgeusia . Metformin in conjunction with a multi-component lifestyle intervention in patient C ( EL + ) with IIH and PCOS may support weight management . GLP- RA license for weight management may be useful in immediate GPP management of IIH require weight loss , however cessation of GLP- RA be demonstrate to result in weight regain and therefore should be consider a long- term intervention . If GLP- RA be only prescribed short-term , patient should be counsel that weight regain be likely once the medication be stop . Topiramate prescribe for IIH may result in weight loss due to side-effects appetite GPP reduction , however this should not be prescribe solely for the purpose of weight loss Bariatric surgery Copyright For woman live with IIH and a BMI > kg\/m , bariatric surgery should be A ( EL ++ ) consider . For men live with IIH and a BMI > kg\/m , bariatric surgery should be consider GPP When consider selection of bariatric surgical procedure , a gastric bypass or C ( EL - to ) sleeve gastrectomy may be preferential Bariatric surgery may be consider a an early intervention for IIH a ICP have C ( EL ++ ) be demonstrate to reduce at week follow the procedure Patients with active IIH may warrant priority referral for bariatric surgery give the GPP importance of weight loss and maintenance in the disease A multi-disciplinary assessment of patient suitability for bariatric surgery should be GPP undertake by a bariatric specialist unit EL = evidence level , GPP = Good Practice Point Copyright Figure : PRISMA flowchart Copyright Weight Management Interventions for Adults With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension : A Systematic Review and Practice Recommendations Sally Abbott , Fiona Chan , Abd A Tahrani , et al .
