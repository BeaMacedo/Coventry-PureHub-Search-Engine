what i hear from people live with obe participant live with obesity no prom be sity these aspect seem to be very important for qual select because none of the available prom be consider ity of life the body q eating behavior subscale suitable reason include the absence of question on general come close to measure these aspect quote from experience of stigma the inability to use the questionnaire a psychologist longitudinally and the absence of validation evidence in people undergoing obesity treatment below one healthcare provider highlight the importance of assess both internalized weight body image stigma and the effect of experience of weight stigma two third of the participant vote to include the pro body internalized weight stigma refers to the stigma direct image vote healthcare provider partici towards oneself there be a correlation between inter pant live with obesity a considerable difference be nalized weight stigma and the impact or acceptance of observe in the preference of healthcare provider and partici weight stigma it be important to not only assess inter pant live with obesity several participant live with obesity nalization but also the effect of weight stigma such a mention that they do not want the focus of body image to be it impact on healthcare engagement and mental or social on physical aesthetic they suggest that a prom assess health quote from a researcher body image should focus on the individual perception of their this healthcare provider be support by a participant own body conversely healthcare provider report that the living with obesity who also highlight the importance of prom available for assess body image should accurately capture the impact of weight stigmatize experience capture the individual feeling towards their own body they emphasize that body image change drastically after weight none of the question assess the impact of stigma loss treatment and therefore it be an important measure they only focus on the prevalence of stigma no scale be consider suitable for use in obesity treatment in my experience a a dietitian body image be a very quote from a participant living with obesity important domain because weight loss intervention have such a big effect on body image patient tell me that the perspective of their body change drastically discussion after weight loss treatment quote from a dietitian after a group discussion re vote on body image result this study describe the selection of a core set of pro and in more vote in favor of include body image vote prom for assess quality of life in clinical obesity care the healthcare providers participant live with obesity process include a systematic review and a multinational con and the body q body image subscale be select sensus meeting that be attend by people live with obesity a the most suitable prom vote healthcare provid and by healthcare provider from various discipline the pro er participant live with obesity and prom select be iwqol lite self esteem obesity surgery body q physical function physical symptom psychological the op scale be not consider suitable for measure social function social function eat behavior and body image function and the promis and owqol be not validate and qolos excess skin these prom contain good for obesity treatment we point out that the selection measurement property ensure that the measurement of qual of prom for research purpose or clinical practice may thus ity of life provide valid and reliable outcome this core set far vary significantly from those use in registry a number can be use in different cultural and geographical setting spe of healthcare provider suggest that some prom could be cifically these prom be available in and language omit from the core set and that others contain too many respectively no prom be select to measure stigma question between seven and ten per pro by omit these because the available prom be consider unsuitable to the prom feasibility might be enhance and less time would best of our knowledge this be the first multinational and multidis be need to complete the questionnaire accord to the ciplinary effort in obesity treatment to achieve the goal of stand participant live with obesity at the meeting omission be ardizing the quality of life outcome that matter most to patient not necessary they do not consider complete multiple the primary objective of the core set be to improve the quality of questionnaire a burdensome provide their purpose be care in obesity treatment by reflect outcome that be most explained and feedback be provide important to patient to this end we incorporate the extensive use prom in clinical practice be increasingly become input of people live with obesity throughout the development of routine in the treatment of cancer for example prom be the set the core set represent the selection of prom that should use to monitor symptom and quality of life during the pre minimally be use in clinical obesity care operative and postoperative period their administration the same pro and prom be select for the clinical and interpretation lead to good identification of posttreatment practice core set a for the research core set which allow the symptom and problem enhance clinical decision make same set to be use for different purpose the pro mostly process and improve communication between patient and align with the finding of coulman et al they identify healthcare provider the ability of prom to improve out eight theme with regard to live with the outcome of meta come in cancer care be far illustrate by basch et al bolic and bariatric surgery despite frequent use of the sf they report that in comparison to usual care digital symp in prior obesity treatment research it be not include in the tom monitoring use prom significantly improve physical core set a participant favor other prom base on face function symptom control and overall quality of life there be validity in a recent validation study by de vries et al even evidence that prom can improve survival in cancer care the sf be not support by sufficient validation evidence in obesity treatment prom data offer a unique oppor in patient undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery due to tunity to enrich consultation by redirect the focus to those the irrelevance of some question and lack of relevant item aspect that concern patient most or problem that would oth to patient among other reason align with the cur erwise go undetected sharing prom data facilitates active rent finding recently greene et al establish a selection patient participation in progress tracking and outcome assess of prom to be implement in the metabolic and bariatric ment thereby enhance communication between patient and surgery accreditation quality improvement program in the healthcare provider use prom in obesity usa they identify health self confidence mobility treatment enables healthcare provider to deliver care that aligns and everyday activity a the high ranking pro domain with patient need and ultimately to provide value base and and select the promis obesity relate problem scale high quality care to further aid implementation of the op scale and obesity and weight loss quality of life prom in clinical practice we develop a user manual for the instrument owqol for inclusion the s q o t consensus core set appendix table meeting take a different approach to select prom by despite the benefit of prom there be challenge regard focus on their suitability for the selected pro domain ing their implementation first the participant live with obesity surgery obesity indicate that the lack of feedback on prom score be only this be unlikely to have bias our result fourth not all what withhold them most from routinely complete prom online participant participate in the entire two day meeting we conclude that prom should only be implement in clin either a a consequence of the different time zone or because of ical practice if the score be share with the patient to facili the multiple meeting that be plan prior to the combine tate this process a digital platform be require that automatically congress of the european association on the study of obesity dispatch prom before consultation and allow the prom and the international federation for the surgery of obesity and score to be display on a dashboard for healthcare provider metabolic disorder european chapter and people live with obesity to see several electronic during future meeting we shall continue to improve the cur measurement system be propose in the literature such a rent core set of prom include the development of a prom mobile application web base system or email reminder for stigma further validation and additional translation of the patient perceive these approach to prom adminis qolos excess skin questionnaire moreover the issue of cost tration a easy and user friendly second appropriate associate with the iwqol lite self esteem questionnaire shall train on prom administration and interpretation be neces be address on the contrary the body q and qolos be avail sary for healthcare provider the use of a minimal able free of charge possible new prom shall also need to be con clinically important change mcid that be the small change sidered in detail we discuss these point extensively in our previ in a treatment outcome that an individual would identify a ous article submit future s q o t meeting shall be necessary important could aid healthcare provider in interpret to determine how the prom should be use in registry if this prom score the mcid from the iwqol lite total score core set be adopt and implement it could potentially promote range from to point depend on baseline severity the collection of outcome that be clinically important to patient the mcid for all quality of life domain of the body q and expert alike and thus improve the quality of obesity treatment be currently be determine determine a mcid for the globally ideally this set of pro and prom should be comple qolos will also be necessary mented by a set of clinical outcome that form a core outcome set the key strength of our study be that we involve a geo for obesity treatment graphically diverse panel of healthcare provider from different discipline as well a participant live with obesity most of whom be involve in patient representative network initially conclusion our goal be to involve healthcare provider and participant liv ing with obesity in a ratio but on account of cancellation a core set of pro and prom for measure quality of life in we end up with a ratio the moderator ensure that the clinical obesity care be select by a heterogenous group of participant live with obesity could voice their opinion suffi participant live with obesity and healthcare provider the ciently there be some limitation too first due to the multiple set include subscales from the body q physical function subject that need to be address and the strict time sched physical symptom psychological function social function ule prolong discussion during the meeting be not possi eat behavior and body image iwqol lite self esteem ble second some expert join the meeting online which may and qolos excess skin questionnaires a prom for stigma have limit their involvement during discussion third one be not select because the available prom be consid healthcare provider involve in the development of the body ered unsuitable the prom that be select represent q be instruct not to vote but she could participate in the outcome that matter most to patient and should serve a a discussion see that this restriction apply to one participant minimum when measure

the prevalence of a healthy weight bmi in this a useful future analysis a a recent analysis of iih study be similar to a previous large study of iih in life database find that a change in bmi be this

at baseline despite similar oct papilloe be not clear dema measure this could potentially reflect a delay although the outcome base on bmi be similar in diagnosis due to a low suspicion of iih in for

kg m this be consistent in that baseline bmi a role for dietary modification and pharmacother potentially and have a great influence on visual apy to avoid future weight gain a this have be outcomes

where such a address child overweight be if you refer them it tend to be reject our work lie sn focus group fg no longer in their role description and they pn be expect to focus on other priority although the hcps recognise they when ask about access to exist some gps felt that address child weight have a role in provide child weight information on child weight status gps be a marginal part of their role management advice they felt limited and pns discuss that they have no time because usually they come in about in what they could offer and the lack access to these data from other source

cultural belief i ve not get a handle on i think it ncmp data would be helpful for a conversation about child weight yet gp you re then not just solely rely could be defensive some hcps do not upon

hcps receive make dedicate appointment to make them more reluctant to address on childhood obesity and nutrition which discuss child excess weight there be a child overweight contribute to reluctance to initiate sense that this also give parent time to conversation about child weight prepare for the conversation i think it s quite difficult to talk about weight when they ve the family get so and i think it s a problem that lot of it discussion about child weight require people would like to tackle but they just much go on sn fg discuss more than the extra thirty second i have don t really know where to start we vignette at the end of the ten minute consultation don t have much in the way of training sometimes i will get over that by say sns particularly saw the feedback letter about

discuss that the wording this in the context of ethnic and cultural to enable hcps to access and share be problematic often cause anger and factor health information and measurement distress for child with other healthcare i think in this population the issue be that i ve have quite a few parent who be organisation and to join up work the certain minority that we have here very upset receive the

also identify useful specific skill ncmp would enable them to easily track which include skill relate to help i have one mum and her child be child s weight status and be alert to patient change behaviour motivational overweight but she be a young parent and child who be rapidly gain weight interviewing and to provide child she actually didn t know how to cook the weight management and healthy eat it s all this collaborative work isn t it dinners and yeah we spend a lot of time advice many participant felt that more it ll stop do the work twice and also with her give her worksheet how to cook training on provide this advice would it s about be on the same page as well make potato and bean rather than go to help them address child weight some because a parent may come to u and say the fish and chip shop sn fg also comment on the need to consider i don t know what the problem be and we different cultural context when provide it s kind of address it in the sense of can say well actually let s have a look at healthy eating and weight management can they do thing a a family together in what the school nurse measure pn advice term of their diet change the chapati from white flour to brown flour simple through discussion of the vignette i think what s the term motivational thing like that change the rice to brown access to interpreter for parent with interview i ve do a lot of that in rice maybe everyone go out for a walk limited english be identify a a the past i think that s useful look at together or go to the park together facilitator to have conversation about motivation to change pn gp discuss vignette child excess weight in these family i ve never really have any formal training on when ask directly about incentive we obviously want to be work with deal with obesity in child i think some but not all gps identify that the family and for them to feel that it s more practical training be need on what incentives through the quality and something beneficial not just to the you can actually offer and what be prove to outcomes framework remuneration to child but to the whole family pn work most effectively gp general practice for specify healthcare activity to proactively address childhood participant discuss signpost you need to be aware of what different excess weight could be a useful approach or provide lifestyle and weight type of food for different type of people however some hcps felt that this may management resource to family often refer to different culture sn fg result in a tick box approach highlight free online material such several pns and sn discuss the a change life a national campaign if the patient speak limited english but be value of learn skill and approach to improve family dietary intake and able to understand some of what i m say to have conversation and provide physical activity some participant i would probably address the main symptom weight management advice from peer felt that a more bespoke resource pack and then invite them to return with an contain specific weight management interpreter for the follow up appointment what i actually believe a well be share advice for family would assist them in gp discuss vignette the experience as well like you say i do opportunistically address child excess this with that one sn fg weight if you want it do gps to have conversation with parent about child i think an information package to be able discussion excess weight you have to attach to give to a parent would be great i some kind of incentive for all gps to take think from a healthcare professional point summary it seriously unfortunately but at the of view be to give them something to put same time i think there run the risk of it gps pns and sn recognise the in their hand that they will sit and look at become a tick box exercise to get that importance of have conversation when they ve get five minute pn payment gp with parent about child excess weight but they experience several barrier hcp knowledge and skills the need hcp approach hcps identify while some related to family factor for increased hcp knowledge of child several useful approach to many be structural or relate to the weight management service and the conversation with parent about hcps themselves the study be able to requirement to develop certain skill child excess weight they describe identify facilitating factor for hcps in be identify a facilitator some hcps link weight to the problem that the have these conversation which have in primary care perceive that there be child be present with and give inform the potential strategy the exist service in their local area that common sense advice relate to food author have propose see implication they could refer to but it be not always provision diet and physical activity for practice that would address both know what these be when training and skill be discuss hcp relate and structural barrier within offer people service that be some highlight that more training on primary and community care the study available to them if you know what the give this advice would far facilitate have provide valuable new insight on service be that be out there then it make them have these conversation see facilitating factor for hcps particularly the conversation a lot easy gp hcp knowledge and skill many hcps around structural aspect of health care recognise the need to involve the whole and support the development of hcps when ask about skill and train family when provide this advice knowledge and skill a previous research participant identify generic hcp have focus on facilitator relate to i would relate it to the problem that they skills that be helpful to them in hcp parent interaction present with so one of the other thing have conversation with parent that might be a factor here might be that about their child s weight include structural change that would support the child be carry more weight than they communication skill and be train to hcps in have conversation with research british journal of general practice june e rreesseeaarrcchh parent about child weight relate to hcps in have conversation with in line with the present study s finding organisational aspect within primary and parent about child weight the main barrier identify in these latter study community care for example system of primary and community care hcp include a lack of confidence in initiate dedicated appointment well access to group that be well place to address discussion inadequate time fear of weight in primary school age child undermine parental trust lack of interpreter and financial incentivisation be include participant serve recognition of overweight and cultural however the need for a more joined up socioeconomically disadvantage and perception of weight by parent approach across healthcare organisation ethnically diverse population be difficulty in and avoidance of give and school with cross agency work recruit which enable the study to nutrition advice and lack of collaborative and sharing of information and weight explore the challenge face within work with other organisation assessment data include from the these community the data collection ncmp be highlight hcps fear of damage parental trust approach include the use of vignette and relationship while common may be several approach that hcps be which be identify a a valuable method unfounded adult with obesity mostly already use be identify as good to explore in more depth the challenge welcome health professional initiate strategy when have conversation face by hcps this be further conversation about weight and parent with parent about child weight but strengthen by the involvement of a of young child be generally receptive multidisciplinary hcp group who advise participant clearly articulate where to hcps discuss child weight on the development of the discussion they need far development however the insight of this study s guide and vignette in their knowledge and skill this participant into barrier such a limited include knowledge of local child limitation include the focus on the cultural awareness and a lack of train weight management provision and english healthcare context it be not and skill in give weight management skill in weight management advice and advice have reinforce previously clear whether these finding would support behaviour change awareness identify hcp training gap the need be transferrable to the wider uk and of the cultural context and the ability to good address cultural competence international context however give to provide culturally appropriate advice and safety in gp and nurse training have the resonance of the finding with the be see a important be highlight a have the need for international literature on the barrier better skill development of medical and to hcps have these conversation nursing professional in nutrition and it be likely that there would be some strength and limitation obesity assessment and management applicability of the finding to other this study address a knowledge the development of skill and resource contexts the recruitment approach for gap relate to strategy to support to support hcps in child weight primary care professional depend management activity be a prominent on advertising so the study

so much raise your consciousness around please god more to it be it wholesome be it pure everything halal participant faith leader isn t necessarily good for you participant faith leader some food

pulse synchronous tinnitus headache and papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss most people live with iih be also live with obesity population study have observe the increased incidence of iih in those with an increase body mass index bmi and an elevated bmi be show to be directly associate with great risk of a diagnosis of iih furthermore a relationship between bmi and visual outcome have be establish a study find patient with bmi kg m be more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro ophthalmology visit and every kg m increase in bmi increase the odds of severe visual loss by time iih be emerge from be a disease of the neuro ophthalmic axis to be a distinct metabolic disease where the underlying pathophysiology may be modify by weight loss moreover iih have be demonstrate to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promote further weight gain at the same time psychiatric disorder be sevenfold more common in people with iih compare to the general population which may result from common biological pathway relate to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal cortex hpa axis dysfunction which may mean weight management be more challenging for people live with iih obesity result from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factor and there be a strong genetic component underlie interindividual variation in body weight a a result the human body be biologically hard wire to prevent weight loss this be a challenge for the treatment of iih since excess body weight have an impact on iih development and improvement moderate weight gain of be associate with a great risk of develop iih among both people with and without obesity meanwhile weight loss in the range of have be report to lead to remission and weight re gain have be find to be a risk factor for disease recurrence copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology sustain weight loss therefore be essential for long term remission of the disease however clinical practice be vary in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategy for iih indeed sustained weight loss have be demonstrate to be essential for long term remission of the disease the optimal weight loss method for iih be yet to be determine especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity hence the aim of this study be to identify evaluate and summarise the relevant publish study relate to weight loss intervention for iih in term of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcome such a vision and headache a second aim of the study be to convene a panel of expert in the field of iih and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice point

consensus base recommendation for weight management in people with iih base upon the evidence identify within the systematic review and grade accord to the quality of available evidence where evidence be not available for iih population gpp be formulate base upon evidence extrapolate from obesity literature the graded recommendation be show in table copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology discussion the recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people live with iih be not only because weight loss reduces icp but also that it reduce mortality and reduce the burden of prevalent and incident obesity relate complication weight loss be recognise a a modifiable factor in the treatment of iih this study seek to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for iih which be identify a research priority by the james lind alliance priority set partnership the panel make graded recommendation base upon the evidence identify by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in good practice point from the obesity literature table while there be one rct demonstrate level evidence for the direct use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in icp to month and one cross over study level utilise a vled for month which demonstrate efficacy in term of icp visual and headache outcome these two study have not be replicate the result of this analysis therefore demonstrate the shortage of high quality evidence a there be no study that could be directly compare due to different weight management method be use and a lack of standardised outcome measure sustain long term weight loss should be consider a a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patient with iih patient with iih with overweight or obesity should be counsel sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in iih they should have their weight measure and bmi calculate to assess the weight management option and monitor the intervention efficacy although there be no rcts that evaluate the measurement of overweight and obesity compare to not measure these outcome the panel agree that this aspect of iih patient care be essential the degree of weight loss require for iih symptom improvement be less clear a study report amount of weight lose with a variety of outcome measure there be no study copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology evaluate the time where the minimum amount of weight lose be correlate with the point of disease remission there be level evidence that demonstrate a reduction of weight between be require to achieve disease remission in the vled cross over study of body weight loss be correlate with reduction in icp resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcome and the iihwt disease remission be define a icp to return to normal level at cmh it be therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle intervention deliver in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss require to induce remission of iih the panel consider this evidence and recommend the target weight loss should be for iih disease remission however the panel acknowledge that this goal be unlikely to be achieve via a lifestyle intervention alone and a realistic goal may be weight loss which may still offer some improvement in iih symptom there be no study evaluate solely physical activity intervention in iih physical activity could be recommend a part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss behaviour therapy have be show to be a useful adjunct when incorporate into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance license anti obesity medication aoms do not feature in this study a there be no study with primary aim of use pharmacotherapy for weight loss in iih it be noteworthy that there be inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such a acetazolamide and topiramate and to a less extent zonisamide be use to manage iih and have previously be clinical observe to reduce weight the method by which acetazolamide cause weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia a salty rancid or metallic taste sensation that persist in the mouth nausea dyspepsia vomiting and diarrhoea acetazolamide be not well tolerate in this patient group with up to of people discontinue the medicine in our systematic review it be interest to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and icp at month follow the direct use of acetazolamide copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology bariatric surgery have the great sustained weight loss up to month clinician manage iih may be reluctant to refer patient for bariatric surgery due to fund access and misconception regard the safety of bariatric surgery such a operative mortality excess skin and nutritional optic atrophy physician may be concern about csf shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery however bariatric surgery have be show to be safe and more cost effective than csf shunt gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedure be superior to gastric band in term of weight loss and icp reduction in people with iih for obesity gastric bypass have be find to be the most clinically effective and most cost effective intervention compare to other weight management programme and have the high quality adjust life year qaly gain superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in iih may be explain by the enhanced postprandial glucagon like peptide glp secretion a emerge data find that exogenously administer glp significantly reduce icp without weight loss another key consideration when understand the impact of an intervention be the natural history of the disease include disease duration this could have an impact on outcome for example in people who have have the disease for many year it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that have occur due to axonal loss and hence why in study with long disease duration the visual field measure may not improve likewise papilloedema may acutely be present and without intervention may regress to the mean strength of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review which be prospectively register on prospero and all screen data extraction and quality assessment be blind and conduct by two reviewer the evidence be translate into clinical recommendation which be make by multi disciplinary expert in obesity and iih copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology hence support the translation of the research for clinical application there be certain limitation to the study the included study all use different outcome measure and a variety of weight loss method this mean a meta analysis be not able to be perform due to study heterogeneity this heterogeneity in iih study evaluate weight loss method need to be consider when plan future clinical trial in iih we also only include publish study which mean there be potential for publication bias a meta analysis be preclude it be not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias use funnel plot the study population of our included study be predominately female a reflection of iih be less prevalent in male however the finding be therefore not generalisable to male specifically there be a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in iih in a male population and for both gender at a low bmi of kg m none of the study include woman who be pregnant which be an area in need of evaluate a it have be recommend that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input most of the study be of short duration with only one study report outcome longitudinally at year the longer the reporting period the more missing data occur however future study should be encourage to include long term outcome to determine cost effectiveness and intervention durability people with iih who have obesity compare to healthy weight have significantly low health related quality of life score moreover obesity and weight gain have be find to be independent predictor of poor mental health relate quality of life psychiatric symptom in association with iih be usually poorly describe and underestimate in the literature but the prevalence be report to be as high a give that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patient engagement and adherence to weight management intervention and indeed iih treatment this require investigation hence future study should collect quality of life and copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology psychiatric outcome measure to evaluate the influence of weight management intervention and include long term outcome data collection to assess durability of the intervention conclusion we advocate for obesity to be view a a chronic disease with complex contributory association and prognostic implication to iih rather than merely a risk factor weight loss should be see a an important tool in the management of iih the biological driver of obesity may explain why short term weight management intervention be often insufficient for long term disease remission the hierarchy of effect in weight loss method seem to be analogous to the reduction of icp with bariatric surgery have the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the iih population however not all patient will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention in such case multi component lifestyle intervention should be provide but it should be acknowledge that weight loss be likely to be modest and iih disease remission be therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in iih symptom wnl eapp http link lww com wnl d wnl eapp http link lww com wnl d wnl etab http link lww com wnl d wnl etab http link lww

between september and august method secondary analysis of routine maternity care datasets random effect multivariable logistic regression be use to ascertain the factor associate with obstructed labour main outcome measure risk factor for obstructed labour and related postpartum complication include intrapartum stillbirth maternal death uterine rupture postpartum haemorrhage and sepsis result obstruct labour be diagnose in woman among these woman result in maternal death and experience postpartum complication woman under year of age or ci those who lack formal education or ci be unemployed or ci nulliparous or ci do not receive antenatal care or ci or receive antenatal care in an informal healthcare set or ci be more likely to experience obstructed labour ineffective referral system be identify a a major contributor to maternal death conclusion modifiable factor contribute to the prevalence of obstructed labour and associated adverse outcome in nigeria can be address through targeted policy and clinical intervention tweetable abstract obstruct labour affect of labour in referral level facility across nigeria improve referral pathway will reduce morbidity associate with obstructed labor bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology page of introduction obstruct labour also refer to a labour dystocia be a condition in which the progression of labour be hinder by a mismatch between the size of the present part of the fetus and the woman s pelvis despite the presence of adequate uterine contraction this often occur because of the disparity between the fetal presenting part and the maternal pelvis globally obstruct labour affect approximately of pregnancy and account for substantial long term complication such a vesicovaginal fistula and of maternal death in low and middle income country include nigeria obstruct labour continue to be a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality for instance a recent national cross sectional study of maternal near miss find that uterine rupture result from obstruct labour account for of severe maternal outcome and of maternal death in nigeria due to widespread poverty and poor nutrition in low resource setting such a nigeria many woman have a poorly develop pelvis which be a risk factor for obstructed labour furthermore many pregnant woman in nigeria give birth at home without the assistance of skilled professional when complication arise during delivery the lack of an effective referral system make it challenge for woman to receive prompt medical attention result in severe consequence such a uterine rupture maternal death and long term disability like vesicovaginal fistula gynaetresia and secondary infertility in those who survive additionally newborn may experience complication such a stillbirth severe birth asphyxia neonatal death cerebral palsy and developmental disability due to the absence of a coordinated maternity care data collection process across the country estimate of obstructed labour and it associate risk factor in nigeria have primarily be base on data from individual health facility with vary data collection procedures the current study provide a comprehensive estimate of obstructed labour use the maternal and perinatal database for quality equity and dignity programme mpd qed from referral hospital spread across the state and six geopolitical zone of nigeria this be the first study to report the prevalence and risk factor of obstructed labour use a routinely collect nationwide electronic database in nigeria the mpd qed page of bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology harmonise database allow for a systematic examination of the prevalence associate risk factor and outcome of obstructed labour across a national sample of tertiary facility the finding of this study will help address the critical gap in knowledge regard the burden of obstructed labour at referral level health facility in nigeria and identify factor that can be target to reduce it occurrence and complication method study design and population this study involve a secondary analysis of the mpd qed database a maternity care dataset routinely collect from referral level hospital across six geopolitical zone of nigeria of these be public hospital and be private health facility the mpd qed population comprises woman who be admit to these hospital between september and august for childbirth or due to postpartum complication arise within day of childbirth the database data collection process and quality assurance procedure have be previously describe briefly the mpd qed programme use a custom build district health information software dhis platform that be employ in the collection of maternity care data from referral hospital in nigeria the database record maternal sociodemographic information medical and antenatal care history labour and delivery detail the baby s clinical condition within the first seven day of life and the mother s postpartum observation until hospital discharge day after give birth or death whichever occur first our analysis focus on woman who be at least week pregnant at the time of delivery and who deliver in the participating in the facility woman who be admit after birth be not include in the current study population we define obstruct labour base on clinical diagnosis and follow the strengthen the reporting of observational study in epidemiology strobe guideline in report the study bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology page of outcome of interest the main outcome of interest be prevalence of obstructed labour and sociodemographic and clinical factor associate with obstructed labour the secondary outcome be postpartum complication such a ruptured uterus postpartum haemorrhage sepsis intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay follow obstruct labour other outcome of interest be adverse perinatal outcome such a intrapartum stillbirth early neonatal death neonatal intensive care unit admission and the identification of contribute factor for maternal death covariates in our analysis we consider various variable from the dataset know to influence pregnancy outcome these be classify into three category sociodemographic factor maternal age marital status level of education occupation and the partner s occupation past medical and obstetric history parity previous caesarean section previous miscarriage and chronic medical condition and index obstetric history registration for antenatal care referral status from low level of care number of gestation pregnancy induce hypertension gestational diabetes antepartum haemorrhage continuous monitoring during labour and birth weight of the child statistical analysis we describe the characteristic of woman with and without obstruct labour and the corresponding maternal and perinatal outcome mixed effect multilevel logistic model with random intercept by hospital be construct to examine the odds of obstructed labour relative to those without obstruct labour initially a bivariate model be employ to identify associated factor which be subsequently use to build a hierarchical multivariate model the conceptual model propose that more distant determinant such a sociodemographic characteristic may influence outcome either directly or indirectly through other proximate determinant such a obstetric history current pregnancy care or complication therefore three level be adopt sociodemographic factor past medical and obstetric page of bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology history and current pregnancy history model comprise of all sociodemographic variable model retain statistically significant variable from model and be far control for past medical and obstetric history similarly model retain all variable that be statistically significant in model and far adjust for index pregnancy history bivariate and adjust odds ratio of the final multilevel model along with confidence interval be present the level of statistical significance be set at use a sided alternative hypothesis result between september and august a total of woman be admit to the referral hospital for labour among these have obstruct labour of the woman with obstructed labour be refer from low level of care the characteristic of the study population be summarise in table woman who be young than year of age single lacking formal education and unemployed be more likely to experience obstructed labour similarly obstruct labour be more prevalent among nulliparous woman those without antenatal care those refer from informal healthcare setting and those with a birthweight of gram or more among the woman with obstructed labour have a maternal death and have maternal morbidity table postpartum anaemia be the most common morbidity fifteen woman have rupture uteri have anaemia diagnose after birth and have postpartum sepsis approximately of the woman be admit to the intensive care unit and more than half of the woman have a hospital stay longer than day after delivery of the total birth be stillbirths table of these occur during labour among the live birth experience early neonatal death and approximately one third be admit to the neonatal intensive care unit with birth asphyxia a the most common indication for admission birth asphyxia and sepsis be the common cause neonatal death table show the odds of obstruct labour base on woman s characteristic woman who be under year have bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology page of increased odds of obstructed labour a compare to woman over year of age year old aor ci to year aor ci lack formal education aor ci or have primary education only aor ci be unemployed aor ci or have a sale trade job aor ci and be nulliparous aor ci or grand multipara aor ci have increase odds of obstructed labour in addition obstruct labour be associate with a no antenatal care aor ci or receive antenatal care in an informal healthcare set ie traditional birth attendant or other informal set aor ci furthermore fetal macrosomia aor ci and the absence of continuous labour monitoring aor ci increase the likelihood of obstructed labour as well a have a chronic medical condition aor ci the most frequent contribute factor to maternal death among those with obstructed labour be delay in seek medical assistance delay in appropriate referral and delay in receive care from medical staff in addition a lack of necessary equipment or consumables at healthcare facility be identify a a contribute factor in of case table discussion main finding we find that around two percent of labour in referral level hospital in nigeria be obstruct with most of the woman refer teenager first time pregnant woman woman without formal education woman who be unemployed woman who do not receive antenatal care or receive pregnancy care from informal healthcare setting fetal macrosomia and woman who be not continuously monitor during labour have increase odds of experience obstruct labour furthermore our study reveal a high prevalence of maternal death perinatal death and maternal and perinatal morbidity among woman page of bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology with obstructed labour lack of an effective referral system be identify a the primary contributor to maternal death strength and limitation the strength of this study lie in the involvement of a substantial number of pregnant woman and accurate representation of referral level tertiary hospital across nigeria s geopolitical region this study represent the first multi centre estimate of obstructed labour in referral level hospital across nigeria base on routinely collect maternity datasets the meticulous analysis and harmonisation of data across hospital site lend credibility to our finding provide a reliable portrait of the national situation within the high echelon of healthcare service in nigeria however this study do have some limitation the diagnosis of obstructed labour be base solely on the clinical assessment make by the attend physician and the subsequent decision to perform a caesarean section we acknowledge that there may be variation in the threshold for diagnose obstruct labour among clinician and that some woman might have be misdiagnosed or misclassified interpretation previous study conduct in single nigerian tertiary hospital have report a prevalence of obstructed labour range from to however our finding which show a prevalence of for obstructed labour represent referral hospital across nigeria the prevalence of obstructed labour and associate maternal morbidity and mortality in this study be low than population base study in low to middle income country this may be due to the focus of this study on referral level hospital teenage pregnancy impose a great physiological burden on young mother which can be exacerbate by inadequate dietary intake and poor antenatal care this can result in complication during childbirth in addition woman who lack formal education may come from family with low socioeconomic bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology page of background and may marry early before their pelvis be fully developed teenager may also have challenge access contraception in contrast woman who have receive formal education be more likely to marry later have great access to contraception and take advantage of the available antenatal care and hospital delivery service therefore it be important to provide equitable access to formal education and reduce barrier for young woman to education first time mother be prone to labour anxiety and fetal malpositioning such a occipito posterior head position which can predispose to labour obstruction in the current study on third of woman with obstructed labour do not receive antenatal care woman who do not receive antenatal care be three time more likely to experience obstructed labour this underscore the importance of focus on improve antenatal care attendance a an intervention to prevent prolonged obstruct labour the absence of antenatal care during pregnancy deprives woman of vital information regard her pregnancy such a multiple pregnancy macrosomia fetal anomaly and other risk factor for obstructed labour however it be worth note that most woman who experience obstructed labour receive some form of antenatal care those who receive antenatal care in an informal setting be eight time more likely to experience obstructed labour this be similar to observation in ethiopia suggesting that the quality of antenatal care be just a crucial the likelihood of obstructed labour increase two fold in woman refer many woman seek pregnancy care and delivery at primary or secondary healthcare facility because of their proximity to their home and affordability of these service with effective referral pathway in place woman who be at risk of obstructed labour can be refer to facility where caesarean section can be perform however the absence of timely recognition of poor labour progress can result in delay in refer woman lead to prolong obstruct labour fantu et al also indicate that referral from low level of care be a significant risk factor for obstructed labour woman who have macrosomic baby birthweight kg be three time more likely to experience obstructed labour macrosomia a major cause of cephalopelvic disproportion have be widely recognise page of bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology a a common contributor to obstruct labour woman can be screen for macrosomia by attend antenatal care allow for intervention before labour skilled personnel during labour and continuous labour monitoring to detect failure to progress can also result in early intervention notably the absence of continuous labour monitor with a partograph double the likelihood of obstructed labour and one third of woman with obstructed labour fell into this category postpartum anaemia be the most prevalent morbidity which align with a prior observation from a tertiary health facility in northern nigeria this may be attribute to the presence of anaemia prior to pregnancy many woman enter pregnancy with chronic anaemia cause by malnutrition and infection additionally this finding may also be due to an underestimation of blood loss follow surgical intervention for obstructed labour the occurrence of postpartum sepsis may be heighten by factor such a history of anaemia prolong labour multiple vaginal examination and surgical intervention the risk of uterine rupture increase with multiparity previous uterine scarring and abnormal fetal lie the prevalence of perinatal morbidity such a birth asphyxia can lead to complication include visual impairment seizure disorder and learn difficulty pose a significant social and economic burden on family the healthcare system and the nation a a whole to improve maternal and perinatal outcome in nigeria it be necessary to establish an effective referral system that connect low level care to tertiary health facility moreover enhance the capacity for emergency obstetric care be crucial previous research on maternal near miss in nigeria have reveal that some tertiary hospital lack the necessary equipment to provide emergency obstetric care in our analysis delay in receive care after arrive at referral health facility be find to be contribute factor to maternal death by improve the capacity to provide emergency obstetric service the incidence of adverse outcome in woman with obstructed labour can be reduce conclusion bjog an international journal of obstetrics gynaecology page of obstructed labour be a critical obstetric complication that can result in significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality the result of this study suggest that several intervention can be optimise to improve the quality of care for woman with obstructed labour these intervention include increase access to quality antenatal care ensure continuous labour monitor for all woman in labour improve referral pathway from low level facility and provide improved emergency obstetric care with a focus on prevent sepsis address the underlying contributing factor for obstructed labour such a increase woman s empowerment and autonomy through access to free education require

most participant would be open to attend a healthy lifestyle programme participant report high level of perceived effectiveness and self efficacy barrier to attendance be identify in the domain of burden opportunity cost and ethicality as well a a lack of information about the format content and target audience of the programme participant indicate that they would be more likely to enrol if they be aware the programme offer opportunity for social interaction and interactive holistic learn conclusion although prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme be high this do not translate to attendance at the programme use the tfa can inform both the intervention refinement process and how recruitment and marketing of the programme can be support provision of more information

in the united kingdom the direct cost of overweight and obesity to the national health service nh be estimate to be in the region of two to three billion pound a year rudisill et al there be a lack of

great psychological distress there be several potential predictor of parent engagement however few comprehensive theoretically driven prospective examination have be conduct leave a gap in understand how to intervene and address parental engagement spence skelton ball in the uk local authority commission family base programme that be develop for both parent and child to attend together a per the need of their community phe however low uptake of these programme continue to remain an issue upton et al family base programme commission by local authority typically emphasise lifestyle and behaviour change use psychological principle berry et al knowlden sharma mclean et al sung chan et al be typically deliver in the community evaluation of family base community programme in the uk show that they be effective but continue to be impact by poor participant engagement both enrolment and completion upton et a morawska et al there be also limited exploration of participant engagement from a theoretical lens burton et al our study therefore adopt the theoretical framework of acceptability sekhon et al to explore prospectively parent understand of a family healthy lifestyle programme there be a high rate of invitation decline which be arguably the first barrier that require exploration in good understanding poor uptake dhaliwal et al an overview of cochrane review highlight much of the process evaluation of family base lifestyle programme focus on retrospective account of how parent child find the lifestyle programme this temporal assessment be limit because it can not capture reason for invitation decline nor an understanding of how the programme be initially perceive which could affect decision to join or prioritise attendance at a family programme a prospective account mimic the real world setting in which people need to make choice about engage with a novel programme ortblad et al acceptability be also a crucial but often overlooked factor in determine uptake and ongoing engagement with a healthcare intervention sekhon et al therefore our study adopt a novel theoretically drive approach to explore prospective acceptability of a healthy lifestyle programme to potential user prior to engagement with it we conduct a mixed method assessment of prospective acceptability of a healthy lifestyle programme in warwickshire uk the national child measurement programme ncmp be establish by the uk department of health to monitor trend in height weight and body mass index of child in reception age year and again in year age year in publicly fund uk primary school phe parent and caregiver be usually provide feedback regard their child s weight status along with signpost to useful resource include the option to self refer to healthy lifestyle

generally unaware of the associated negative health risk and make minimal change to lifestyle habit grimmett et al west et al even among parent who report intention to make change after receive weight feedback only one in two late report behaviour change mooney et al park et al unfortunately uptake to service support positive change and a healthy lifestyle be poor and there be a decline rate at

two mixed method study appraise the barrier and facilitator to attend community base lifestyle programme for parent of overweight and obese child kelleher et al the quantitative and qualitative study be of moderate to good quality however the two mixed method study be both of relatively poor quality either focussing on a non diverse sample o connor et al or lack information about sample and methodology rice et al facilitator include parental concern for child s psychological well be an opportunity for social interaction and a lifestyle focussed approach to weight management barrier to enrolment included stigma surround excess weight parental denial of their child s overweight status and logistics e g travel distance schedule conflict etc whilst previous study have be carry out investigate barrier and facilitator affect initial and continued attendance of healthy lifestyle programme acceptability of these programme remain relatively underexplored acceptability be a multi faceted construct that reflect the extent to which people deliver or receive a healthcare intervention consider it to be appropriate base on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional response to the intervention sekhon cartwright francis pg it can be assess across three temporal perspective prospective concurrent and retrospective of these three prospective assessment of intervention acceptability be crucial a it can highlight factor which may influence the acceptability and overall success of an intervention and this assessment can inform refinement to an intervention in contrast to retrospective acceptability assessment which may only assess acceptability among participant who have already choose to engage with a give intervention prospective acceptability assessment mimic the real world setting in which people need to make choice about engage with a novel programme ortblad et al the current study focusses specifically on the assessment of prospective acceptability that be the acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme to potential user prior to engagement with it method study design and ethic this study employ a mixed method design involve a survey and one to

but do not align with the domain of the tfa be cod inductively quantitative and qualitative data from survey and interview response respectively be then triangulate and analyse in combination in line with each domain of the tfa result participant sixty people respond to the survey and thirteen express an interest in take part in the interview six participant be then interview however the remainder later decline participation participant demographic be show in table overall the majority of participant be female aged year white british and employ of the survey participant n survey participant have access their child s ncmp report weight status with one participant report an overweight status a further participant have not access their child s report weight status but believe their child to be a healthy weight thirty nine survey participant have never hear about the healthy lifestyle programme and participant report know a bit or have hear some thing about it of the interviewed participant none have access their child s ncmp report weight status but four believe their child to be a healthy weight prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme survey and interview finding be triangulate to provide an overall representation of participant response in line with each domain of the tfa qualitative and quantitative finding be largely complementary with qualitative interview data mostly find to agree with and expand upon survey response for each domain affective attitude survey data reveal n participant would definitely sign up to the programme and n participant report that they would consider it many survey participant cite that they be open to attend a programme to promote healthy choice if there be a problem with my child s weight i would want to do something about it survey open text comment also how it might help themselves a parent and caregiver to gain access to relevant information i m always on the lookout for information and help to get my kid to eat well and how to be a good parent survey open text comment however some participant reflect on how they be confident they already have appropriate health management tool in place for their family we be a fairly active family that s eats in moderation already survey open text comment some participant describe how they be not sure if the programme would suit them or their child with concern around learn mobility and availability not sure it would suit my special need child survey open text comment this type of help be not usually available to work parent survey open text comment interviewee initial feeling about the programme be generally more positive than those give in survey response most interviewee have hear about the programme but the majority do not share detail knowledge about the programme content purpose nor target audience in response to the researcher s brief overview of the programme participant report see the potential benefit it be a difficult process try to find the right nutrition and everything for kid and balance physical exercise and give them something to do every day after school so i think to have that support about the right thing to fee and do it a a family approach a well i think it s a good set up p participant felt there would be benefit to attend include the opportunity to meet others and share experience and the potential for socialise their child i think it s always good to hear from other family and how they approach thing in the group set like they might have tip or you know thing that they do that i could apply in my life p i do look at it just for the social aspect if the child would get to do something separate from the adult i would be sort of more willing to go because then he s get a bit more of a social aspect p burden twenty four survey participant disagree that effort be require to engage with the programme however concern be state by both survey and interview participant about the length of the programme be too long the thing that would make me be like nah would be the fact that it s seven week long like that just seem like that s too much p most survey participant select session a a more desirable programme length whilst one interviewee suggest that they would be more open to participation if they could choose which session to attend let s say we be give a timetable and it be each week and then the topic they be gon na cover and it be kind of like you could pick and choose which one you go to i think that that would make me more likely to pursue it than if i saw it and be just like right i have to be commit for seven week p another issue be regard the location of the session the session be deliver across a number of location e g community centre remotely however most survey participant select their child s school a a preferred venue this be reiterate in the interview where many participant believe the programme should be deliver at the school their child attend i think school would be the most ideal i think it s a friendly and familiar space p other suggestion from survey participant include gp surgery at home or at a local child centre all in all participant state that the location would need to be local and an appropriate travelling distance but to be honest as long a it s a reasonable travelling distance that wouldn t matter as long a it wasn t a ridiculous journey we d be quite happy to do it p perceived effectiveness forty one survey participant agree the programme would likely encourage change in diet and physical activity interviewee also consider it to be largely valuable and positive however most of the participant believe they be already engage in the practice that the programme would aim to teach family and child so there be nothing for them to gain personally i didn t see what the value of go would be because quite a lot of the stuff it be talk about do we do here anyway like he cook with u and we ll we ll talk about what s healthy and what isn t healthy with him when we re eat it so i didn t see the point in go p however participant do see the effectiveness of the programme for family that do not already practice healthy eat the mum would fee her child fish finger and chip or chicken nugget and chip and stuff like that in my head it s for people like that so help them understand how to make like healthy food for their child and sort of help and to give their child idea for what s good and what s not good p intervention coherence thirty two survey participant agree the programme would help make healthy choice this be support through interview which indicate that participant understand the aim of the programme and believe it would be appropriate for people who need it provide they engage with the content it do sound like if you need it it would be helpful if people be willing to engage with it obviously you don t see some positive outcome if they re not gon na engage then p self efficacy self efficacy be high among most participant with twenty nine survey participant suggest that they do have the confidence to engage with the programme and interviewee indicate that they felt they would be able to apply the content to their own life i think it d be good i think we d be able to do it apply programme content a i say we enjoy learn new skill and do different thing a a family p some participant however do discuss how viable the advice around healthy eating would be within the rise cost of live the thing about healthy eating obviously be cost isn t it be it affordable like a bar of chocolate s a lot more cheap and fill than say a piece fruit or something p opportunity cost when ask about prioritise the programme fifteen survey participant suggest the programme would interfere with other priority and interviewee suggest that attend the programme be not a priority a their child be not overweight or do not have obesity however participant do declare that they would prioritise their attendance at the programme if it be need if it be something that i felt we need then i would prioritise it p most participant describe numerous prior commitment already hold reiterate how family would have to juggle exist commitment to attend we have some sort of stand commitment anyway but as long a it be on a day where like we didn t have something go on it would be fine p ethicality interviewee felt that the content would largely resemble practice they already engage in at home e g make healthy choice portion control maintain a well balance diet two participant however raise ethical concern around how the programme facilitator would manage address weight in a safe stigma free way my only concern be if you find out a child be significantly heavy than they re suppose to be be there enough support around help them and their family and get them to what you see a the right sort of weight p if it s in the school day and it s in the school i would feel a bit like my daughter would feel not embarrass cause like she wouldn t really care or understand but it s a bit like ohh why re these kid go into a group and other kid aren t p participant also discuss if the programme content would be tailor or adjust to specific need appropriately such a culture dietary need and socio economic status maybe people be like intolerant to dairy or wheat or there be vegan or vegetarian pescatarians or you know like all these different group of people that have specific dietary requirement or cultural thing p be they gon na also address the fact that some family don t have as much money to spend on food and then kind of give you advice or information about how to adapt to different budget p one participant emphasise need to know who be deliver the programme and whether the content be evidence base i would want some sort of and not even necessarily like a formal qualification but experience or expertise in the area that they re advise me on p general acceptability overall survey participant describe the programme a acceptable and offer positive remark about it i think it s great to get as much information a you can for your family there s always room to learn something new or try new thing survey open text comment the need for clarity around programme content interviewee raise several uncertainty about the programme upon read promotional material i e leaflet nmcp letter and the parent portal participant express a lack of clarity about who the programme target audience be so there be a bit of information on the school newsletter say we ve attached erm this this leaflet about the programme i m not sure if it be the same programme or something similar that they re do for just free school meal child i wasn t sure if it be something that we could do because we re not a free school meal family p some participant note it would be helpful if the promotional material provide more detail about what be cover in the programme this would help parent and caregiver decide whether they would benefit from attend obviously you can t put the full programme and you wouldn t want to but sometimes a few example be enough to go oh that s what that mean that d be really interesting or not p another participant discuss how they have try to search for detail about the programme online but find the information confuse i do google it the programme but not a lot come up and what it do show a lot different area so i be a bit lose and confuse p participant report a preference for interactive session but be not sure what kind of delivery format the programme adopt which again pose a a barrier to attendance as long a it s fun for them child i think they d be alright and it s not just sit there listen to a lecture kind of thing you know a bit interactive or something p i would want to know like what the format kind of be so be it gon na be like we re gon na be give task and do group work or be it gon na be more like a lecture and you know like where we re told information or be it gon na be more like work sheet p discussion summary of finding this study be the first in the uk to investigate the prospective acceptability of healthy lifestyle programme for child and family overall general prospective acceptability be high quantitative survey response and qualitative interview response be corroborative with the tfa domain of perceived effectiveness and self efficacy be prominent and perceive burden be a common area of concern participant response indicate the healthy lifestyle programme be a good programme to consider attend and engage with over half of survey participant agree that the programme would be helpful in support family to make healthy choice just under of the sample felt confident that if they do attend they would be able to apply the programme content within their daily life interview participant however indicate that the programme be not a priority for them with the majority state that they view the programme a an effective tool for other people but not for themselves common concern be also centre around the domain of opportunity cost and ethicality include issue with the programme be too long attendance compete with exist priority and a lack of confidence in the programme leader s qualification and ability to approach the subject of weight appropriately and sensitively overall participant felt that the programme sound appropriate and it would be beneficial for family that need the extra support but they themselves do not require the programme currently consistency with the literature the exist literature suggest that high acceptability often predict good uptake to intervention diepeveen et al fisher et al gulliver et al hommel et al sekhon et al with prospective acceptability be a key influence factor when eligible participant be decide whether or not to take part in an intervention rct sekhon et al establish prospective acceptability therefore be an effective method for identify and address barrier to enrolment in intervention such a healthy lifestyle programme ortblad et al sekhon et al this study identify burden and ethicality a the main barrier to enrolment yet overall prospective acceptability of the healthy lifestyle programme be high despite this uptake to the programme remain low with many participant state that the programme be acceptable but not necessary for their family in relation to the impact of ethicality on enrolment a critical barrier be the stigma associate with be overweight and attend associate programme previous study have report that overweight child frequently do not perceive themselves a be fat nor do they want their peer to see them a such therefore they be reluctant to attend programme target weight loss grow et al similarly many parent do not want to raise the subject of weight with their child or enrol them in programme for fear of upset them or harm their self esteem grow et al newson et al visram hall geddes this be reflect in our study with many participant express concern about how the programme would be deliver and how their child s weight would be address the ncmp have previously receive negative feedback from parent and ethical concern around body image and stigma in young child falconer et al gainsbury dowling gillison beck lewitt hughes timpson mooney et al statham et al syrad et al the relationship between ncmp and the healthy lifestyle programme may also be influential to the perceived ethicality of this programme a such it be vital that healthy lifestyle programme address issue associate with weight in a sensitive manner and provide clear information to parent about the role of the programme a an independent entity to the ncmp information and advertising material that clearly reflect the programme s content and sensitive approach to weight management may offer reassurance to parent and caregiver exploration in the tfa domain of burden demonstrate that logistics be an important issue when participant be consider enrol in the programme schedule issue and logistical problem such a conflict activity have previously be report a key barrier in review investigate enrolment and retention in weight management programme dhaliwal et al lucas et al skelton beech participant express that they have compete priority and that the duration of the programme be too long for them to commit to schedule session at less burdensome or more flexible time e g evening or weekend or provide remote attendance option may reduce the perceived burden and improve enrolment and attendance overall prospective acceptability for the healthy lifestyle programme be high particularly in the domain of self efficacy and perceive effectiveness however participant still indicate that they do not intend to enrol in the programme a it be not relevant for them previous qualitative study with parent of child with overweight and obesity have suggest that parental denial be a barrier to enrolment in programme such a the one investigate in this study grow et al newson et al visram et al although over half of our participant agree that the programme would be helpful in support family that attend to make healthy choice the majority do not believe that the programme content would be relevant for them the frequency of these response may reflect parental denial of an overweight status in their own child however many parent do not share the weight status of their child therefore it be not possible to ascertain the accuracy of participant assessment that their child would not benefit from the programme gather information with regard to child s weight status at the time of survey interview participation would allow future research to good assess the role of parental denial v a genuine lack of need when investigate enrolment in healthy lifestyle programme previous research show that enrolment and continued attendance in healthy lifestyle programme be high when child view the programme a an opportunity to have fun and make friend grow et al newson et al stockton et al social interaction be a moderator of affective attitude towards the healthy lifestyle programme in our study with some participant express an interest in attend the programme if their child would get a chance to socialise during the session participant say they would be encourage to enrol in the healthy lifestyle programme if it provide an opportunity to interact with and support other parent this reflect the finding of newson et al where family be more likely to decide to attend a childhood obesity intervention if the social aspect be clearly advertise previous study have report a preference for an holistic approach to healthy lifestyle programme include physical activity and behavioural component rather than a focus on weight loss or diet alone be more acceptable to parent and carers grow et al newson et al stockton et al this be also apparent in this study with participant express that they would be more likely to attend if they know the format be more interactive rather than lecture base whilst the healthy lifestyle programme be investigate in this study do provide many of the element highlight here i e socialisation opportunity for the child and an interactive approach to learn about healthy live many participant be unsure of the programme format and this add to their hesitancy in enrol this emphasise the importance of accurate communication and marketing to ensure that key detail be include a lack of clarity and information in promotional material be a notable barrier to enrolment in this study interview participant express uncertainty about a number of element of the programme include who have write the content the expertise of the deliverer what the delivery format be and who the programme be for this lack of information appear to play a significant role in prevent participant from enrol in the programme the importance of clear communication in overcome barrier to enrolment in family health programme have previously be demonstrate by qualitative research assess retrospective parental acceptability of a family base intervention for young child with obesity kinlin et al identify a clear theme of insufficient programme information at the time of referral and a limited understanding of the intervention impact parent expectation of service and affect their decision to enrol improve the marketing and communication material for the healthy lifestyle programme would effectively address many of the concern identify use the tfa such a ethicality and opportunity cost many facilitatory factor identify such a opportunity for socialisation and interactive learning be already in place therefore more accurate or detailed information would provide an opportunity to highlight these area and increase programme enrolment strength and limitation this study be one of the first study to use the tfa sekhon et al to prospectively explore specific construct of acceptability for intervention refinement apply the tfa facilitate a structured and comprehensive approach to which have enable u to anticipate and address potential issue in advance to support intervention engagement and uptake the use of a mixed method design triangulate data and adherence to coreq guideline demonstrate considerable rigour in the research process report here we do not reach the recommended participant for qualitative research francis et al no new theme emerge from the interview follow the survey open text response whilst we do request that participant share their child s ncmp weight status many participant have not access or do not want to access this information therefore no accurate data concern the weight status of participant child be available to inform the interpretation of our result and subsequent recommendation this limit the extent to which we can draw conclusion about the specific prospective acceptability of this programme to the family of child carry excess weight compare to those of a healthy weight the interview in this study be attend by female caregiver so future research may consider strategy to engage male caregiver in share their opinion of healthy lifestyle programmes far the sample overall be majority female white british age year and employ the extent to which the result can be generalise to the wide population be limit and may be specific to this demographic future research may benefit from targeted recruitment of male young year or old year caregiver or caregiver to child from non white under represent or seldom heard community implication and recommendation participant view indicate that a healthy lifestyle programme could be valuable to parent and caregiver of child with overweight and obesity and could influence positive change in family behaviour several approach could help to address the acceptability issue identify by the present study for instance detail communication and clear advertising for parent and carers about the benefit of healthy lifestyle programme be need this could be deliver during event where parent be already present at the school e g parent even evidence from this study suggest that the material use to advertise the programme should provide clear information about who the programme be for what the content be the format of delivery and who will deliver the programme a key facilitator to enrolment that be identify in this study and support by previous research be the opportunity for social interaction provide by the programme it would therefore be beneficial to highlight the interactive nature of the programme refer to the included activity such a preparing and taste food and playing game this would allow parent and caregiver to weigh up the potential benefit to attend the programme against any perceived barrier emphasise that the course be free to attend and introduce flexible attendance may also reduce the burden of commitment associate with the week programme and promote attendance conclusion this study be the first to investigate the prospective acceptability of a self referral healthy lifestyle programme explore prospective acceptability use the tfa enable a comprehensive structured exploration from which we be able to prioritise most significant barrier and enablers affect engagement with and uptake of the programme acceptability be generally high but a significant information barrier be identify with many parent indicate that they be unaware of the programme s existence and those who be aware of it demonstrate uncertainty about content and eligibility to attend participant response indicate that parent recognise the value of programme such a these for support family to make healthy choice although many parent do not believe that they be the target audience the benefit of these programme for allow social interaction amongst both child and parent as well a for provide an interactive learning environment be also highlight if school and healthy lifestyle service therefore provide clear signpost about the format and content of the programme it purpose and who be eligible to attend as well a address the time commitment require by the current programme this may help to increase enrolment reference biro f m wien m childhood obesity and adult morbidity the american journal of

care experienced and experience poor health unequal access to healthcare and short life expectancy people experience homelessness have report barrier to register with primary care stigma and a lack of continued and integrated healthcare such inequality increase emergency care utilisation among homeless population dedicate healthcare provision for homeless individual have therefore be implement

housing provision in warwickshire a uk county warwickshire be a rural county with small and large town and increased rate of homelessness give the population rural homelessness be associate with

participant to share their experience in an order and manner that matter to them and enable the researcher to hear about wide context two broad question invite participant to talk about their journey with housing include during covid and their experience of access healthcare include the nurse lead outreach service prompt reflection and follow up question be ask to help participant move through their story and clarify event audio record interview be conduct with one train researcher participant could have a professional present participant be offer a supermarket food outlet voucher to thank them for their time verbal and write debriefs be provide analysis audio recording be semi auto transcribe use microsoft word and correct transcription be verbatim include hesitation and repetition analysis adopt a six stage reflexive thematic analysis iteratively cod response and organise code into theme and subthemes analysis be underpin by social constructionism which assume that meaning be construct through social interaction for example a participant s storytelling may be influence by perceived power difference or previous experience in an interview situation this lens align with the embeddedness of the study design whereby professional facilitate recruitment and the subjectivity of researcher be embraced result a total of participant take part in interview range from minute no professional remain closely present during interview demographic participant be age to year and most often male n and white british n most participant report difficulty estimate how long they have be homeless often with cycle of episodic homelessness finding four overarch theme be interpret from the narrative interview each capture poignant experience in participant story these theme be discuss and present with quotation theme become homeless participant discuss the circumstance lead to become homeless and some described cyclical pattern of homelessness though experience varied commonality lead to homelessness included bereavement and relationship breakdown i live with my mum when she die i have to leave the house erm so i get put in a b b bed and breakfast i end up live on like the street in town and sleeping in doorway and then covid have hit and during covid they i think they have to house people p why we get evict be cause i lose my child they re in foster care ever since that you know just stop pay everything p participant face complex issue include finance mental and physical health problem break relationship and isolation when these issue compound cyclical pattern of homelessness be more apparent when you re street homeless everything just seem as bad a possible a it a it can be there s no future there s no respite from it there s no rest from it it s ten time bad p theme unable to escape a stigmatised identity participant describe live a stigmatised identity through share experience of discrimination and abuse participant often collectively refer to negative stereotype hold among the public such a assumption of drug and alcohol use and lament how little understanding of homelessness exist people just look down at you a fella come out and start on me and he say stop be a drug addict and like start on me everyone think everyone s an alcoholic or drug addict when they re homeless and i wasn t an addict p some participant felt discriminate against by national housing or organisational policy such process may be necessary for the prioritisation of resource but some participant express frustration that this meant they stay rough sleeping for long some participant felt unheard by service i didn t have a priority need then to help me get off the street which mean i have to remain on the street longer p i don t know what s the point they win t listen they ain t bother that s how i feel p experience with inflexible system be also reiterate participant describe that not have resource like a smart phone restrict access to healthcare and other service unless you ve get a smart phone it s impossible it s the same now with doctor i try to sort my electric out the other day for this flat i ve be give and i say look can i send you proof of tenancy through the post and they re like no it s get ta be do over smartphone i say but i haven t get a smartphone so they win t let me put the bill in my name p theme nurse be a crucial bridge connect u to healthcare the nurse lead outreach service be well receive with participant collectively endorse that this service should continue participant compare the nurse to family member and described receiving treatment and feeling care for the outreach service be contrast with previous inflexible and unsupportive experience with mainstream healthcare well the nurse be pretty good actually on the street if it wasn t for the nurse like go around the street at the minute for the homeless what would the homeless have they d have nothing p there s two professional like represent for you so it s like a family member you know they say say you should always go to see a doctor with a family member so there s another pair of eye and ear there so you wouldn t just get fob off cause a lot of them do try and fob you off p the outreach relational and friendly approach of the nurse be crucial participant could choose whether they want to engage and the nurse could identify change in someone s health many participant describe that access the dedicated homeless nurse be easy than attend primary care setting because the nurse visit them in situ rather than require travel to an appointment nurse lead drop in session in community space also offer more direct access to healthcare instead of wait to get through to your doctor they ask what s wrong over the phone you can just ask like i ask nurse about my wrist the other day it s really a lot easy have access to them in here p it s be helpful erm they re much more approachable than the gp also they ll come out to see me which be a benefit it mean i can plan my work p participant perceive that their health have improve because of access to care and treatment as well a the nurse support them to develop self efficacy with manage their health like make sure i take my medication i get antibiotic blood thinner erm epilepsy tablet and if i didn t come here and her nurse help me i wouldn t take them p nurse do me a prescription and she get my leg sort and all sort of thing so without nurse i would have be screw really to be honest p theme be house and beyond participant relay their journey to be house include the role of covid and move between emergency or temporary accommodation participant describe a range of feeling after be house follow rough sleep participant express gratitude and need to adjust to have amenity like a kitchen television and bed some question how they have ever sleep rough participant also discuss additional responsibility in manage their income and develop household skill now when i look at homeless people i m think wow how do they actually do that how do they do that i don t know how i be do it with a little sleeping bag p i have to like keep pride in it make sure it s tidy the bill be pay make sure that i don t let certain people in now you get a responsibility p be house also make logistically receive and store medical supply feasible benefit health management i think if i be homeless again i would struggle because i have to have a lot of medical stuff send to me like the pouch and the spray and everything that s all sent to me so i d need some kind of address p some participant be house in area or situation that pose risk to health wellbeing and maintain tenancy such a via substance misuse by other tenant this be sometimes link to an insufficient supply of housing embed support provision be need to reduce or respond to these risk i want to get out of there cause there be one or two of them drink a lot p a suggest here maintain housing include follow everyone in be often a great challenge than be house participant reflect that system do not work with people specific accommodation policy such a visit policy intend to safeguard tenant and availability of housing in preferred location mean some participant do not accept or stay in housing provision i let somebody in and i get kick out p they try to send me off to neighbour local authority so i go street homeless because like i say my kid be in current area my parent be in current area p in addition some participant report not know when or where they would be move until the time come because of rapid rehouse need wait list or professional bid on their behalf it s hard because we have to wait for the housing officer to say this be happen and we didn t know where we be go until we be in a taxi we would ask the taxi driver where we be go and he d tell u p discussion eighteen people describe their story of homelessness and healthcare during covid and beyond the nurse lead outreach service be highly commended participant describe the nurse akin to family member because of the care and advocacy they provide the flexible service be contrast with experience of inaccessible mainstream care housing journey be complex and non linear after be house include during covid participant value housing necessity some express disbelief about how they have normalise life on the street however some participant do not accept or stay in housing where they perceive risk this study follow an evaluation of the nurse lead service from the professional perspective the inter relation between mental health physical health and housing be evidence across both study with social exclusion of homeless individual far depict people experience homelessness face reduce access to mainstream healthcare because of inflexible system unaffordability professional attitude and an individual s ability to access care participant here reiterate these experience and value the friendly and dedicated approach of the dedicated nurse participant perceive that the nurse provide direct access to care and promote self efficacy in self care find to be low among people experience homelessness participant link have a secure home with improved wellbeing and be able to store medical supply which can improve medication adherence where dedicate healthcare provision for homeless individual be not commissioned policymakers should ensure that mainstream healthcare be flexible and person centre and that provider work collaboratively for example have an address be not legally require to register with a primary care provider although some provider may request this and contribute to inequalities further research investigate emergency care utilisation among individual access nurse lead outreach service would develop understand about the wider health and economic benefit covid bring additional complexity for local authority need to provide rapid housing housing first model similarly prioritise provide rapid housing regardless of substance use and have report success for housing stability and health outcome however participant here highlight that rapid housing must also integrate adequate support to ensure individual maintain tenancy some participant describe risk associate with other tenant misuse substance such experience may pose health risk to peer influenced substance use and housing instability if individual leave the accommodation with evidence that initial reduction in homelessness during covid be not maintain nationally sufficient resource must be available to local authority to provide housing and integrated support strength and limitation use narrative methodology participant choose how to share their story this approach mean participant be in great control of their interview especially a journey be complex although some participant may not have be aware of how their housing journey relate to everyone in such a if their situation be manage by a professional participant be not directly ask about social care and so any role of social care in a participant s story may not have be explore the face to face approach meant that participants meet the researcher in setting familiar to them and be facilitate by known professional however individual not access any health provision or support service be not interview this study also interview a male majority though woman tell their story woman be more likely to fall into hidden homelessness use informal support network for long before present to local authority and can experience gender base discrimination interview be conduct only in english and with majority white british participant with wider evidence advocate for improvement to anti racist and culturally responsive provision some interview be also short health problem and autism find to be more common among people experience homelessness may have also contribute to shorter length interpret the finding alongside national and international evidence will also contribute to a full picture of the impact of covid on people experience homelessness conclusion this qualitative evaluation explore the story of people who have experience homelessness in one uk county in tell their story participant highlight the benefit of person centre approach to healthcare and housing provision participant describe that the dedicated nurse lead outreach service make it easy to access healthcare and self report improvement with their health and wellbeing furthermore mainstream healthcare should improve inclusion through flexible process and professional training about homelessness covid pose challenge for local authority who be instruct to house individual rough sleep story from participant provide further

which be accompany by quote in table table an overview of the theme generate from the interview theme subthemes quote to support it s quite difficult to transport if it s quite full because it may leak p a i find that it go green and light up when you draw in if i be try not to be see smoke i felt like i be a walking glow stick p b i personally prefer the tobacco one it felt like you be smoke a cigarette because of the taste p e a the e cigarette offer if there be some way of you be able to like test the the vape juice it taste differently to what it smell p d you re not lose anything if it doesn t work with it be free it ll encourage a lot of people on low income to try it p c i could afford to buy my own it wasn t necessarily about that for me but yeah it be that kind of support that i think just really do it for me p f sometimes you can get information it s like woah it s a little bit too much but it didn t feel like that p e perception of key at first i be use one e cigarette every other day but once i start aspect of the settle down and i be get over that initial like want a cigarette all the b learning and use e cigarette pilot time they last about four to five day p d the e cigarette that s the downside of the programme because they need a spare coil from the begin p a i think the e cigarette liquid should be supply a little bit longer what happen in week time that i run out and i can t afford to buy it p f she s adviser be really supportive for me and she s really tried p f c role of adviser say about you need to learn how to deal with your stress differently behavioural support it help cut that down and re evaluate how i handle stress p b i think the vape plus all the extra support it just make it all worthwhile p e my midwife put me in touch and then adviser text me and that be it she be round in about four day p d d overall perception of the only negative would have be how long it take for them stop smoking in the pilot pregnancy service to get in touch with me i think probably because it s just the two of them do it p c int j environ res public health of table cont theme subthemes quote to support i get the gum it doesn t taste very nice p c and perceive effectiveness because it d patch be on my arm i feel like i d forget a little bit and think i d a negative perception and still maybe reach for a fag cigarette p e experience of traditional nrt patch make a lot of people feel sick i suffer with my sickness throughout my whole pregnancy she adviser didn t want to give me anything that be go to make me feel bad p e patch aren t like cigarette gum isn t like cigarettes the nozzle thing they re preference for not like cigarette e cigarette be the close you can get to a normal use e cigarette cigarette p c e cigarette still didn t feel like a cigarette so i still didn t feel satisfy like if i b advantage of use have have a cigarette p h an e cigarette you control it more how much you vape the amount of nicotine you be use p a a lot of people who have morning sickness you can actually sit just on your bed and relax and feel good and have the nicotine e cigarette quite close to you p a be pregnant be the only thing that s ever really make me wan na quit a motivation to quit smoke p c when you ve be do it smoke for so many year you re just in that kind of routine p c it be very difficult to quit smoking when you live with someone that smoke because obviously the smell it it linger p c b barrier to quit because i ve get depression i m not in a motivated state quite a lot of the time so my motivation go down and then smoking go up p c my partner be still smoke i say like isn t there like something my partner can join on as well to kind of get the vape too so we could have do it together p f use an e cigarette really make me feel positive and kind of make my mind feel good p e i don t want to be run round in a play area or park and suddenly cough a i m run and a smoker and can t breathe so i feel healthier use an journey to c impact of quit e cigarette p b quit tobacco when i try it e cigarette he try it as well he try to but i don t think he stick to it p c he s quite a heavy smoker sometimes he ll say could i just have a little bit of your vape please we re actually gon na buy him one p d i be combine smoke with vaping just for a week or two i be fully on vaping almost straight away p a when it the carbon monoxide reading be come back a nothing it just give you that sense of achievement you re like oh wow p d i will probably keep use the vape i think i will probably continue to use both d effectiveness of the pilot cigarette and e cigarette however if i do choose to quit that would be my for quit and future method of go forward to quit p c smoke intention i can t see me go back to the cigarette i would like to say that i d completely stop vaping but i can t see that happen anytime soon because i don t wan na rush off it too quickly and end up go back to smoke again p d i don t think i want to go back to smoke no i ve do a massive achievement of not do it for that long i don t see why i should go back to it p a theme perception of key aspect of the e cigarette pilot this theme report participant perception of the e cigarettes offer within the pilot subtheme a experience of learning and use the e cigarette subtheme b the role of behavioural support offer subtheme c and overall pilot perception subtheme d int j environ res public health of subtheme a the e cigarette offer most participant felt that the e cigarette offer through the pilot be easy to use high quality and compact and where participant recall their previous attempt with e cigarettes the pilot e cigarette be prefer although pocket size the need for careful transportation be note a few criticism be relate to the transparent and luminous design of one e cigarette with two pilot participant compare it to a glow stick individual have mixed view on the type and nicotine strength of e cigarette or e liquid flavour available some participant prefer a flavour that more closely replicate tobacco others choose a flavour that contrast with tobacco or change flavour over time however some participant struggle to find a flavour that they like due to the preponderance of sweet flavour to overcome this issue a few participant suggest sample flavour could help the e cigarette be free be view positively by participant and be assume to have increase access to those with a low income one participant report that due to financial constraint they be therefore able to start their quit attempt with a free e cigarette sooner for some participant however the e cigarette be free be not a key factor subtheme b learning and use the e cigarette participant felt they be give the right amount of information about the e cigarette via the adviser participant report varying opinion about how long the e cigarette last before need to be dispose of or recharge highlight the role of individual usage pattern one participant describe need but not have a spare coil for the refillable e cigarette and so have to buy a new e cigarette before their next appointment to handle craving another participant raise concern that the length of time e cigarette be supply for may be too short and risk individual not be able to maintain a quit attempt subtheme c role of behavioural support the behavioural support e g face to face visit and encouragement provide by the advisor at both site be describe a helpful non judgemental and informative with regular phone or text contact and in person visit the friendly and dedicate adviser approach be appreciate support not only address smoking behaviour but also the wider factor that can contribute to smoke include stress two participant summarise the benefit of combine the offer of an e cigarette with behavioural support subtheme d overall perception of the pilot participant have predominantly positive experience with the pilot with many say they would recommend it to others a range of perspective be report regard how accessible and timely the pilot be with one participant describe a smooth pro cess however another participant experience delay in access pilot likely due to staff issue theme preference for use e cigarette this theme describe participant negative perception and experience of traditional nrt subtheme a and the advantage of use an e cigarette subtheme b subtheme a negative perception and experience of traditional nrt some but not all participant have previously try nrt product however most participant hold generally negative perception of nrt due to factor include taste though one person find the patch to be good during a previous quit attempt more participant describe unpleasant physical sensation and symptom during pregnancy for these reason participant prefer e cigarette over other form of nrt a an aid to stop smoking int j environ res public health of subtheme b advantage of use e cigarettes one key advantage of e cigarette over traditional nrt product be the behavioural similarity of use the e cigarette compare with combustible cigarette they be also perceive a less harmful however not all participant find the e cigarettes to be sufficiently similar several participant like the control offer by the e cigarette in term of monitoring usage whilst some participant maintain a routine of go to use the e cigarette outside use the e cigarette indoors be another benefit one participant perceive this option could be particularly useful for someone experience pregnancy relate fatigue or nausea theme journey to quit tobacco this theme capture participant motivation to quit tobacco subtheme a barrier to quit subtheme b the impact of quit cigarette subtheme c and the effec tiveness of the pilot for quit during pregnancy as well a future smoking intention subtheme d subtheme a motivation to quit for all pregnant woman their pregnancy and the health of the baby be key motiva tor for quit smoke one participant emphasise that pregnancy have be the only factor motivate them enough to want to quit other source of motivation be to save money or because of encouragement from a partner family member or health professional subtheme b barrier to quit participant report several barrier to quit or factor that make avoid cigarette more challenging two participant describe the length of time they have be smoke a a potential barrier see other people smoke be another challenge for motivation whilst cigarette smoke increase the desire to avoid smoking for some participant for one participant cigarette smoke contribute to cravings several participant discuss their use of smoking a stress relief highlight stress a a barrier to quit another participant highlight the association between depression and motivation to quit a further challenge be that participant partner be unable to access a free e cigarette in pilot whereas pilot do support where possible which may otherwise have contribute to joint quit attempt subtheme c impact of quit quit cigarette within the pilot have various impact on participant health and behaviours some participant describe benefit to mental wellbeing include feeling of pride and confidence after use an e cigarette several participant have already notice or expect improvement in physical health symptom such a reduced chest infection and wheeze two participant appreciate that their clothes and home no longer smelt of cigarette the perceived impact on partner smoke behaviour be mixed sometimes partner continue smoke and others also try to quit use e cigarette with mixed success one participant describe how have an e cigarette around could influence their partner to sometimes use it rather than a combustible cigarette subtheme d effectiveness of the pilot for quit and future smoking intention most participant report that they have either quit cigarettes completely or have reduce their cigarette use a few other participant describe dual use throughout the pilot and others be more quickly able to eliminate cigarette entirely some participant also find the regular carbon monoxide reading motivate and a measure of success there be a notable uncertainty around whether participant would be able to or want to quit smoking or e cigarette in the long term several participant plan to continue smoke at a reduced level or to combine cigarette with e cigarette some partic int j environ res public health of ipants consider e cigarette use a something they would keep do other participant have strong intention to maintain smoking cessation discussion this study describe the experience and perception among individual who have accept e cigarette a part of smoke cessation in pregnancy service in two uk site and offer an important contribution to the evidence base give the paucity of qualitative insight in this area overall participant report that e cigarette in combination with behavioural support be helpful for reduce smoke tobacco our finding broadly align with previous qualitative research from a multi centre randomise control trial where pregnant woman positively perceive e cigarette to be necessary for smoke cessation and outweigh any concern though limit by low trial uptake e cigarette be also indicate to be more effective for quit than nrt patch there be largely favourable opinion of the free e cigarette device though mixed success with find a preferred flavour previous research with a large sample of pregnant woman deduce overall preference for sweet fruit and mint flavour over tobacco flavour our evaluation highlight the importance of provide a range of flavour to suit individual preference a some individual find replicate tobacco to be a useful strategy for maintain motivation perception of the behavioural support e g face to face visit and encouragement be overwhelmingly positive and along with provide adequate information and co verification help woman s motivation to quit within the pilot consistent with wider understanding participant particularly value the supportive interaction from professional consistent with broad evidence and guideline that non judgemental support promotes motivation and behaviour change participant express preference for e cigarette over other nrt product and like the behavioural similarity with smoke tobacco although the e cigarette do not satisfy craving for everyone the exist literature suggest a range of reason for choose e cigarette a a strategy towards this goal include be able to use e cigarette in smoke free area and similar hand to mouth action participant also describe that the e cigarette be free have enable them or could enable others to engage in a quit attempt this finding warrant wider exploration give that previous research have indicate low effectiveness of typical smoking cessation intervention among pregnant woman from low socioeconomic background research have already identify that pregnancy and the baby s health be key motivat ing factor for smoke cessation and in this study the pregnancy and the health of the baby be key motivator to quit smoke it be also necessary to understand and address the potential barrier to smoke cessation in pregnancy to increase success in this study the numerous barrier include the length of time someone have smoke others in the house smoking cigarette form part of daily routine depression and stress consistent with previous research some woman in this study also raise concern about relapse due to post partum stress highlight the benefit of continue social and professional support for stress and mental wellbeing positively most participant report quit cigarette or reduce cigarette use with report benefit to mental and physical health and reduced smell of smoke however there be uncertainty around whether quits could be sustain post partum and long term and whether participant would stop use e cigarette in the future previous review have report that the efficacy of e cigarette a a smoking cessation tool may decrease follow birth and national guidance recommend continue nrt provision after pregnancy if require to prevent relapse further evaluation of the maintenance of smoking behaviour postpartum and the role that e cigarette may play be therefore required whilst the pilot aim to achieve smoking cessation for pregnant woman there be an unclear impact of e cigarette on partner smoke behaviour reduce the smoking behaviour of partner could have additional health benefit via reduce smoke expo sure as well a offer social support and reduce smoking cue some participant int j environ res public health of highlight potential opportunity to support partner to quit smoking and further inves tigation be need to well understand the role of partner in smoke cessation during pregnancy the finding can inform future e cigarette pilot such a embed non judgemental behavioural support provide appropriate information about e cigarette supply multiple flavour to suit various preference ensure staffing resource can facilitate a smooth enrolment process and embedding or signpost to long term support for smoke cessation and wellbeing strength and limitation interview pregnant woman who be provide e cigarette from two different pilot site be a key strength of the evaluation and develop insight into the similarity and difference among participant experience however uptake to interview be challenge with many pregnant woman be uncontactable after obtain consent or at the time of scheduled interview those interview all report a white ethnicity and wider experience and perception among individual from other ethnicity be miss from these finding data be not explicitly collect on smoke habit or quit history the two area in this research vary in demographic with pilot and pilot have a and proportion of the population reporting a white respectively we do not interview woman who decline to take part in the pilot and so the possible barrier to take up the e cigarette offer be not report conclusion interview in this study illuminate how pregnant woman take part in an e cigarette pilot have positive experience of use e cigarette and express preference for e cigarette over nrt there be report success with quit combustible cigarette by use e cigarette far support how e cigarette be increasingly recognise a a harm reduction method for pregnant smoker in the uk the inclusion of behavioural support be also value and the e cigarette be free may have improve access to this smoking cessation strategy for individual with low income however there be numerous barrier to quit and stay quit and woman be often uncertain about whether they would quit smoking or e cigarette use post partum and long term far research explore the view of pregnant woman from more diverse background and those who decline e cigarette be warrant as well a further consideration of the role and impact of partner who smoke in this

connective tissue disorder family history of heds and or musculoskeletal complication criterion and exclusion of alternative diagnosis criterion individual who do not meet the full heds criterion but who exhibit similar sign and symptom may be diagnose with a hypermobility spectrum disorder although a spectrum of symptom have be describe it be now understood that people with either heds or hsd may

criterion previous and overlap diagnostic classification be ed type iii ed hypermobility type or joint hyper mobility syndrome jhs since individual should be deem to have heds or hsd without the need for reassessment with the exception of clinical trial entry this study therefore refers to heds hsd inclusive of previous name for these diagnosis and in awareness that the nomenclature be likely to change in the future the first study of the diagnosed prevalence of heds hsd find that in people in wale have a diagnosis of either ed or joint hypermobility syndrome jhs on their medical record other work have show figure of in and in for recorded diagnosis we know that many people face long diagnostic delay with many undiagnosed a total of of the general population have chronic pain and hy permobility which have be use a a proxy for heds hsd and lead to the estimate that in birth could be impact by heds hsd in healthcare heds hsd can be inadequately manage because of the underdiagnosis and insufficient awareness of these condition as well a their heterogenous clinical presentation understand the implication for childbearing among people with heds hsd be therefore essential to achieve a positive and safe birth experience guidance recommend that an individual assessment be carry out for plan birth with a connective tissue disorder it be therefore important that perinatal staff and individual with heds hsd be aware of the potential risk of complication associate with childbearing however there be limitation to the exist evidence base include the fact that research have not always differentiate between heds and the other rare subtypes of ed to illustrate a population base study find high rate of premature birth birth by caesarean section and several other complication along with long hospital stay for post partum care however these finding incorporate all type of ed include the vascular subtype know to have serious risk during pregnancy exist research be inconsistent about the rate of obstetric complication among people with heds ed increase rate of miscarriage include specifically recurrent miscarriage preterm birth and pelvic instability have be report whilst a large record base study find pregnancy complication rate similar to population incidence a small but in depth study of woman with jhs find good overall out come but potential issue with abnormal scar formation haemorrhage pelvic prolapse deep venous thrombosis and coccyx dislocation precipitate labour the expulsion of the foetus within three hour of the commencement of

infection discussion the aim of this study be to explore the outcome and complication of pregnancy and birth for people with heds hsd a large number of participant complete the survey in a short space of time highlight the desire for people with heds hsd to extend the knowledge base for these condition via research in summary the result confirm high incidence of certain childbearing complication than be typically find in the general population and report others for the first time these include preterm birth pre eclampsia eclampsia pre term rupture of membrane antepartum haemorrhage postpartum haemorrhage hyperemesis gravidarum shoulder dystocia caesarean wound infection postpartum psychosis ptsd precipitate labour and be bear before arrival at intended place of birth high incidence be conclude whereby range for population incidence fall entirely outside of the confidence interval find in this study the meaning and implication of these finding be subsequently discuss this study corroborate previous finding with roughly twice the population incidence of preterm birth among people with heds hsd in addition this study find high than typical rate of pre term rupture of membrane a complication associate with neonatal morbidity and mortality alongside additional risk from chorioamnionitis and placental abruption it could be that this fragility of foetal membrane be one of the factor that contribute to the high incidence of prematurity finding do not reveal any increased incidence of stillbirth consistent with previous research on jhs whilst previous research have find a high rate of miscarriage among people with heds than have be report in the general population this study find no increase incidence antepartum haemorrhage sometimes cause by placental abruption be high than would be expect base on population incidence bleed be not only a risk in itself but placental abruption have be associate with pre eclampsia with both eclampsia and pre eclampsia report at much high rate in this study than in the general population identify risk factor for pre eclampsia e g pre exist hypertension have pre eclampsia in a previous pregnancy be embed in perinatal care this work suggest that people with heds hsd should also be consider a an at risk group it be recommend that finding from this heds hsd population be include in future update of clinical guideline and that heds hsd be embed in initial pregnancy screen questionnaire researcher may far investigate the mechanism that lead to pre eclampsia for example magnesium be one of the important treatment for severe pre eclampsia and eclamptic seizure and magnesium depletion have be anecdotally link to heds other potential mechanism could relate to mast cell degradation product cause issue with placental vasculature blood flow or clotting or the potential role of natural killer cell in pre eclampsia recurrent pregnancy loss and implantation failure a much high than typical number of participant report a precipitate labour consistent with previous small heds hsd study this finding may help to explain the high proportion of baby bear before arrival at the intended place of birth and warrant far longitudinal research to unearth the reason and order of event labour of h or less be strongly associate with high risk of maternal complication include cervical and grade perineal tear post partum haemorrhage retain placenta and prolonged hospitalisation these risk be also important to include in perina tal care consideration particularly give potential issue with wound healing and local anaesthetic for people with heds hsd although the incidence of ineffective local anaesthetic in this study be low than previously find in dental care research prolong latent phase of labour may quickly progress into fast active labour and birth int j environ res public health of for people with heds hsd with the subsequent risk that birth be unattended by profes sionals this outcome may contribute to a more negative birthing experience as well a contribute to explain the high prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse vaginal wall or womb it should also be note that participant in this study be only ask to report prolapse occur in the first week follow birth whereas prolapse be often not recognise until much late to mitigate the potential risk of pelvic organ prolapse when episiotomy be clinically indicate some author have suggest that caesarean section may be prefer though with it own risk this study report caesarean wound infection incidence a high than the available population incidence slow healing be one of the most reported complication by however comparison to the general population be lack and more research be require shoulder dystocia be report at a much high incidence than the population aver age the know risk factor be maternal diabetes body mass index over age over gestational age after week instrumental vaginal birth and epidural although it occurrence be still often unpredictable these finding indicate that heds hsd may be another risk factor to consider and be therefore recommended to be consider in the next revision of the guidance on shoulder dystocia the mcrobert s manoeuvre be commonly recommend a first line treatment however this can result in mater nal pubic symphysis diastasis and other potential pelvic and hip injury the gaskin manoeuvre in a hand and knee position have recently be find to be a safe first line method reduce injury to the baby this could be consider a good first option for people with heds hsd warrant further research postpartum haemorrhage be report to be three time more common among sur veyed participant than the general population incidence this have profound impact a a lead cause of maternal death often cause by failure of the uterus to contract back adequately after birth genital tract trauma or retain placenta a heds hsd have be link to mast cell activation syndrome mcas this finding might align with the theory that people with mcas be more at risk of post partum haemorrhage because of endogenous heparin release from mast cell or enhance fibrinolysis drive by activated mast cell there be an overlap of report birth complication between heds hsd and mcas and therefore treatment for mcas e g identifying and remove environmental trigger and the use of mast cell stabiliser and antihistamine may be indicate alongside mainstream perinatal care research and recognition of mcas in pregnancy be currently lack yet it be believe to impact million pregnancy worldwide annually this study support the clear need for further examination of this complex interplay although nausea and vomiting be estimate to occur in of pregnancy a much high incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum be report in this heds hsd popu lation compare to the general population heds hsd have be refer to a a trifecta with mcas and manifestation of autonomic dysfunction such a postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome pot because of high rate of co occurrence between these condition give that there be also an increase risk of hyperemesis gravidarum in woman with pots potential mechanism might involve a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system hyperemesis gravidarum be a prominent cause of emergency de partment visit and hospitalisation in pregnancy and so this finding highlight the importance of diagnose heds hsd support knowledge among perinatal staff and investigate the possible mechanism implicate e g mast cell thereby potentially develop novel treatment several study have report that people with heds hsd do not feel listen to contribute to traumatic experience in maternity and healthcare service post traumatic stress disorder ptsd be report by almost in people in this study consistent with the prevalence of ptsd previously find among high risk group e g woman who experience an emergency caesarean section or a difficult traumatic or pre term birth post partum psychosis be also notably higher in this heds hsd int j environ res public health of population at nearly compare with an estimate global prevalence of in to birth further research that investigate this finding could facilitate advance in knowledge about the cause and treatment of this serious and distress condition with consideration need a to whether individual with heds hsd ought to be include in exist monitor system strengths limitation and implication these data cover a large number of pregnancy n in over six country and three continent inclusive of up to date diagnostic criterion for heds hsd population health survey be useful for estimate condition prevalence and this research specif ically provide novel insight into perinatal complication and outcome that may need additional consideration by contextualising them with report incidence in the general population comparison statistic be choose with preference give to recently publish large empirical study review or guideline from a similar context e g high income country and international variation in outcome such a gestational age have be re port however comparator data be not available for all complication or nation and these statistic can not be interpret a a control group this examination do provide a clear need for future investigation for example to collect and analyse large scale cod data to document longitudinal childbearing journey with heds hsd and to consider potential mechanism for these association the eligibility criterion and self selection of volunteer participant should be consider in the context of the finding be base on retrospective self report data to reduce recall bias and sit within current guidance the cut off year for pregnancy be however this mean that the maternity history provide may only be partial for some individual although participant report a birth after week could report miscarriage individual who have only experience miscarriage be not eligible to take part regard fertility a plan conception of pregnancy within month be low than have be report in the general population and finding by nature do not include individual who have never conceive vary length of latent labour be report by participant with some reporting latent labour for much of their pregnancy which might be well characterise a an irritable uterus some participant find it difficult to distinguish between the defined latent and active stage of labour and so response be reliant on the participant s recall far prospective research would be beneficial to objectively document the pregnancy and birth experience of people with heds hsd the interpretation of the data should also be consider in light of the sample demo graphics the sample population be more highly educate than average and aspects e g cycle length that may impact fertility be not measure the majority of participant be white therefore the finding of this study may not represent the experience of people of other ethnicity in the included country this may have occur because of the recruitment method use and future work should consider how to achieve a sample that be more reflective of the whole population availability and analysis of accurate record data include improved diagnosis and recording of heds hsd be need future statistical research may also consider the role of comorbid condition and factor such a childbearing age or weight the word woman be use during recruitment which lead to u be contact by people who have experience childbearing but do not identify a cisgender woman and therefore felt exclude from the research we do not collect gender demographic within this survey and so can not say that all who take part be cisgender woman but this potential lack of representation for childbearing people a a whole group should be consider follow this feedback further research be carry out to examine perinatal care for trans and non binary birthing people the majority of report birth occur in obstetric unit this can typically be be cause of plan or emergency caesarean or to manage birth complication or high risk int j environ res public health of pregnancy it be important to note however that people with heds hsd should not automatically be consider to have a high risk pregnancy because of the wide heterogene ity in clinical presentation with positive experience and favourable birth outcome also report many people with heds hsd can still experience an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth and should not be discourage from birth their baby vaginally where appropriate a with every pregnant person planning of perinatal care should be base on the individual s situation risk and wish recommendation from this research focus on update the awareness of possible complication and outcome in healthcare guidance and on include heds hsd in initial perinatal screening questionnaire to ensure appropriate consultation and monitor the aim should now be to increase ed ucation preparation and available support for people with heds hsd and perinatal staff in order to reduce the risk of complication potentially cause an exacerbation into high level of disability this be examine far in the second part of this programme of research and information on the research programme can be find on this website for public dissemination of research www hedstogether com conclusion these data cover a large number of pregnancy n over six country and three continent inclusive of up to date diagnostic criterion for heds hsd this research draw u close to understand how pregnancy and birth complication may be link to heds hsd this be within the context of the recent understanding that in birth could be affect with many people with heds hsd be undiagnosed the finding from this study have highlight that the following incidence be higher in people with heds hsd than the general population preterm birth pre eclampsia eclampsia prom antepartum haemorrhage postpartum haemorrhage hyperemesis gravidarum shoulder dystocia caesarean wound infection postpartum psychosis ptsd precipitate labour and be bear before arrival at intended place of birth these can have profound impact on perinatal and neonatal outcome recommendation include update healthcare guidance to include awareness of these possible complication and outcome and include heds hsd in initial screening questionnaire of perinatal care to ensure that appropriate consultation and monitoring can take place from the start these finding also raise new question about the aetiology of certain perinatal complication which could lead u to a good understanding of cause and therefore treatment option for some serious and even life threaten pregnancy related condition author contribution

find it useful for develop a good care plan discuss it with woman to empower them to be the expert and be hear share with peer be aware of the implication of this condition and increase knowledge and confidence to support and create individual plan with people with heds hsd one participant be concern that the care consideration focus on risk and lack of individuality which put pressure on midwife to refer all woman on to a high risk pathway regardless of the woman s past experience it will put fear into midwife when woman with heds ask for support to birth outside of a consultant lead unit these comment highlight the impact some research in the field have already achieve and may have in the future subtheme improve diagnosis of heds hsd the experience of participant with heds hsd be

complication or traumas include pain i be still not believe when i say the epidural be not work i then tell them correctly which one toe they touch ed type iii uk some professional also highlight the value of learn from people with heds hsd when co create guideline and care plan particularly because of the diverse nature of heds hsd ed present differently in every woman communication be key it be essential to believe woman when they report unusual symptom and not to fob them off because it do not fit in a box senior midwife ireland relatedly woman frequently describe have to advocate for

perinatal care about heds hsd a need to support shared decision making between childbearing people with heds hsd and pro fessionals and a need to raise awareness more generally in the public about heds hsd and childbearing although the need for guideline have also be highlight it be acknowledge that publish care consideration already exist so it be more important to raise awareness and educate people about their existence and main message a key challenge be identify a want to raise the profile by emphasise the importance that professional understand heds hsd and childbearing while also not want to put people off childbearing with heds hsd link to this be the challenge of explain heds hsd care consideration a a whole and in a simple publicly accessible way while also highlight the different potential presentation and consideration of support people with heds hsd for example some people do not respond to local anaesthesia while others do three tool be decide follow discussion the first be in response to the high voted educational tool in the ppi poll an online learning module and would address the first identified need of help professional learn how to support childbearing people with heds hsd this could be develop a an accredited and professional i learn module through the royal college of midwife a prototype short learn course be co design with learn objective information to be provide key resource and signpost the second agree output be to address the need for share decision making by develop a one page freely downloadable tool for perinatal record a prototype be co design to include key information about heds hsd consideration that maternity professional and people with heds hsd may want to consider together and a section to write about aspect unique to that childbearing person and how support could be tailor for them it feature a direct picture from the co create annotation in big blue button where one co creator write parent and staff making decision together and other co creator draw tick heart shape and yes around it the third agree upon output be to address the final need of raise public awareness by create a freely accessible infomercial about heds hsd and childbearing the idea be co design for a person with heds hsd to speak about their experience a midwife to talk about key care consideration and then to show them make share decision together benclarkdesign be commission to create the infomercial a part of a team include an animator voiceover actress and videographer see acknowledgement for detail positive feedback

and confidence on how to support people with heds hsd vidualised perinatal care the sub theme relate to a need to be listen to and believe corroborates research across other healthcare provision with novelty add to int j environ res public health of the field with the sub theme about coordinate appropriate care for childbearing peo ple with heds hsd and reduce trauma and improve experience it be of note that some professional who do not know about the condition comment that they be not aware of potential complication during pregnancy and birth and implication in the postpartum period such a infant feeding this corroborate previous qualitative research with people with heds hsd while add novelty from the professional s perspective additionally there be a potential miscommunication highlight where professional felt they be provide an opportunity for people with heds hsd to explain their condition but this be interpret a the need for tedious repetition by multiple professional with a lack of knowledge clearer communication be therefore recommended about the desire to listen and tailor care for the individual and the co create tool for perinatal record provide a stimulus for this to occur where professional do have knowledge about the condition and be able to advocate for the person with heds hsd or be prepare to actively research and learn about the condition this be felt to provide a positive experi ence when this be not the case some report that it lead to complication that could have be avoid there be concern express in both the survey and co creation that when raise awareness among professional the emphasis could focus too much on the risk of the condition it be consider important that the co create output and public messaging be not aim at put people off childbearing and do not provide the impression that all people with heds hsd be the same and that all should be consider high risk pregnancy because this be not the case although high risk have be identify with a need for monitor in case of a need for high risk consultant lead care in some case action take a a result of be consider to have a high risk pregnancy could actually cause more harm for example serial cervical length screen examine the theory of cervical insufficiency because of abnormal cervical collagen in people with heds hsd have not be show to decrease the incidence of pre term birth however cervical cerclage placement can increase the risk of tear in connective tissue disorder people with heds hsd should not be discourage from birth their baby vagi nally birth environment that support spontaneous push optimal positioning and joint support be encourage to avoid unnecessary trauma to joint and ligament promote calm and relaxation be highly valuable and help to naturally stimulate hormone conducive to birth such a oxytocin and endorphins additionally oxytocin can provide a beneficial antidiuretic effect for people with pots midwife lead care during labour and birth promotes non pharmacological pain management result in low med icalisation and intervention especially if the healthcare professional be well inform about heds hsd this can help to reduce possible heds hsd related complication and problematic post partum symptom such a prolapse from episiotomy coccyx dislocation pubic symphysis diastasis from mcrobert s manoeuvre ptsd and poor wound healing and infection from rd th degree tear episiotomy and cae sarean section additionally potential issue with anaesthesia may be able to be avoid such a ineffective local anaesthesia issue with cervical spine instability csf leak risk from epidural and hypotension from anaesthesia however for people with pot present with hypotension cause peripheral vasodilation phenyle phrine epidural may prevent reactive tachycardia precipitate labour suspect to be due to laxity mean easy passage through the pelvis can reduce the chance of instrumental birth and associated risk ideally for the benefit of both professional and those childbearing with heds hsd perinatal staff would be more prepared for this to occur in people with heds hsd and thus well able to avoid birth occur outside of their intend location potentially with a plan in place for home birth a appropriate or a a contingency int j environ res public health of strength and limitation these be large international survey represent a range of diagnosis relate to heds hsd and profession a high number of people take part especially in the ppi activity and particularly people with heds hsd a hundred participate from the first tweet h this highlight a distinct appetite for these condition to be research and support in healthcare the inclusion of a range of country provide a depth of experience often highlight key similarity in issue such a the need to feel listen to and coordinate maternity care to improve experience however difference in healthcare provision also need to be consider within this context for example issue with insurance coverage do not apply across all included country additionally this be a self report questionnaire with the potential for sample bias from those that wish to have their voice and opinion hear about heds hsd both a people who have have child and perinatal staff a third of childbearing people with heds hsd report a negative experience overall a third neither negative nor positive and a third experienced positive care it be worth note that some participant report in their qualitative comment that they find this question difficult to answer because they have experience variation across their care either within the same pregnancy or across different pregnancy in this self report questionnaire sample bias present a limitation for example healthcare professional with experience with heds hsd personally or professionally may have be more likely to complete the question the recruitment approach aim to mitigate this by share the questionnaire broadly and clarify that no knowledge or experience of the condition be necessary to take part similarly one limitation be the relatively low number of participant from some professional group in the study e g anaesthesiologists and so the result from these group can not be extrapolate to the wider profession s population this study use a mixed method questionnaire with qualitative response use to illustrate and provide completeness to quantitative data in this way it be recognise that participant interview be not implement to gain in depth insight from each participant and the aim of this survey be instead focus on reach a broad population follow previous interview research the use of a mixed method survey approach help to build upon previously publish literature and ensure that the finding could be triangulate and synthesise together in a complimentary way to build up a well rounded picture lead to strong co create outputs patient and public involvement be important to this research from the begin informing focus design and output the international vision for ppi identify key ppi barrier which have be successfully address within this research for example public awareness and communication be increase through our establish network and the engagement hub of heds together and the academic midwife co creator be acknowledge where consent be provide consistency be increase through the use of the three co s framework and the authorship team include those with lived experience of heds hsd and of childbearing parenthood as well a be multidisciplinary across health psychology midwifery and design the co creation not only included patient and the public but also other key stakeholder that could provide barrier or facilitate the success of the output include third sector organisation healthcare professional academic and designer the online and creative nature of the co creation workshop help provide a neutral environment where everyone s voice be consider equal and inclusive for those who could not attend in person due to disability time or travel constraint in this article the term that be use during participant recruitment have be include for consistency for example woman and maternity however we be grateful to the people who contact u during the study highlight that this language exclude trans and non binary people who have give birth we have respond to this and use alternate inclusive language for example perinatal where appropriate although many of these experience may be transferable to the trans and non binary community with heds hsd for example not be listen to and professional lack of awareness we acknowledge that because the language of woman be use in recruitment their int j environ res public health of experience will not be fully represent here additional research be conduct to consider perinatal care for trans and non binary people separately implications the three co create tool provide highly applicable output for use in both education and practice and could help to raise the profile of the current publish care considera tions however further work need to be carry out to raise the profile of the develop evidence base far into guideline such a with the ehlers danlos society and the national institute for health and care excellence these would need to incorporate the additional knowledge from this current paper and the link publication on outcome and complication the developed i learn module for member of the royal college of midwife can now also be expand on a large scale for example into university curriculum for trainee professional and a publicly accessible massive online learn course mooc for continued professional development cpd of healthcare profession al care for childbearing people further research would be useful to objectively examine cohort of childbearing people to more accurately assess the prevalence of heds hsd access these service and more fully understand how perinatal staff and childbearing people can work together to increase the positive experience and safety seek by world health organisation policy this could specifically include further examination of the use of vicryl rapide and increase severe postpartum vaginal prolapse observe by one of the consultant who participate in this research there be also the potential for training and evaluate the use of specialist heds hsd midwife a front line giver of care and hub of knowledge for other perinatal professional like the current model of diabetes and epilepsy care for example conclusion this mixed method research be the first to examine professional knowledge and confidence to support childbearing people with heds hsd and be complementary to a large international survey examine the experience of childbearing with heds hsd not only be the research inform by ppi to ensure the focus be meaningful but solution to the identify problem be then co create to provide applicable output to education

relating to good relationship it free text survey response be analyse from each of the also include connect with the general public through three city host survey this mean a considerable num the role it be also clear from the data that city host ber of the fully trained city host do not respond have a very strong identity and that this identity have a to the survey and it be likely that those be city host key role in make them feel united often refer to who have other priority or commitment which do a a family the only mechanism of change which have not allow them the time to complete the survey those mixed positive and negative testimony cod to it be who respond be likely to have include those with role demand volunteer like the flexibility that the the strong view on the city host programme sur city host programme offer in term of commitment vey participant be mainly woman in august and also the type of role with many volunteer talk in april mainly white british about their favourite role and the benefit of be able in november in april with between to choose to be a team leader or not however there be august and april declare a also disappointment when they felt they have attend health problem or disability which limit their day to event where they be not need finally a mecha day activity and have last or be expect to last at least nism of change emerge from the data which be not month participant take part across the age group include in the theory of change which be title expo from to year to year with high participa sure to culture city host report that the opportunity tion in and year age group gener to take part in the city s cultural event play a part in ally survey participant report similar experience and them accrue benefit from the programme for some perception a the interview participant although there attendance at cultural event be part of their life before be some theme we do not locate within the survey uk city of culture but this be an opportunity data there be no new theme arise from survey data to take part to a great extent for others they might that be not discuss by interview participant dur not have be expose to some type of culture previ ing their interview city host speak of positive wellbe ously but come into contact with it via volunteer and ing impact of volunteer which be also reflect in appreciated exposure to something they wouldn t have survey response city host talk about feel great chosen to see or have the opportunity to see in other happiness have those experience have definitely make circumstance me feel sort of happier p i smile every time i talk intermediate outcome suggest in the theory of about do the host p satisfaction it s quite ful change develop by what work wellbeing be also fill p and good quality of life i spend my whole borne out by testimony from the city host through both life a lot well i m not frustrate and angry all the time interview and survey data table not all of these p reduce anxiety and less depression be also apply to all the city host and many city host explic mention by city host although mainly indirectly the itly state that some of these do not apply to them for confidence building wouldn t say it s stop me from example overthinking thing because i still do that but just yeah i think i ve always be a friendly person i ve i guess i i panic less p and a survey participant always be interested in people so i can t say that s recall it s great for one s mental well be change me so i m not really sure i m not really theoretical mechanism of change the way in which any more confident i don t think than i be before wellbeing might be impact by volunteer be sup p port by the qualitative data these be i connect with others ii feel appreciate iii do something purposeful and meaningful iv develop and use however most city host report one or more of these skill and experience v role and group identity vi intermediate outcome either i a contribution to their enjoyment vii structure routine and distraction viii purpose identity and the meaning of their life ii bet exposure to outdoors and nature ix role demand and ter relationship or iii personal growth and develop x exposure to culture table present these mecha ment a a consequence of take part in the volunteer nisms of change along with relevant quote show how programme table provide example of quote that participant bring these into discussion the most support these intermediate outcome be part of the frequent mechanism of change discuss be connect pathway between volunteer and wellbeing outcome ing with others this include make connection with again this be overwhelmingly positive with these other city host as acquaintance as well a deep intermediate outcome lead to the overall benefit whelan et al bmc public health page of table mechanism of change theme quote from the interview quote from the survey connect with to connect with people so to build a network because i no longer have a a network in the uk i live in in it s be lovely meet others country that year and in country so it be to also make connection with people it s also to to meet ing new people of all new people that be travel and hear their story p walk of life and meet we we re so good friend and not just lady there s all of u you know student male female and it s amaz some great fellow ing just get to meet people again you know even if it s the host or the public out there it s just just host too really good it s just like i say it bring me out of my shell and you know it s very uplifting p feel appreciate they do little reward have like sort of shift you get a bronze award i think there s little thing that do it s good to see the make you feel appreciated and i i and i do think any communication from them be always really positive food hot drink offer p too little measure i think what what s be great some day it s people come up to you and say oh you know you city host like this make the you re do a great job and that s just the general public which be lovely or you know they re really apprecia thought of be tive of if they ve ask the way to something or they ve ask you some information about about something outside in the cold that you ve be able to tell them about p for long period more doable and to feel appreciated do something and i just felt afterwards when i get home i just think well that s just really nice you know those people volunteer for purposeful and they probably need to have that conversation p city of culture be life meaningful the sense that i ve help out the people but also the city and the city of culture and the event and make satisfaction be good event run a lot more smoothly p do good for others and the community which provide me a natural sense of accomplishment develop and oh yes yes it have have in term of just think about what my employment skill be yeah so that that s make i be also grateful use skill and me think about other job role that i might be more interested in future yeah so promote coventry or or or for be give the experience do do something along those line p opportunity to attend well i i do think a i say before it be important to stay in the world and to and to keep learning i don t think course such a dis you be ever too old to learn and you can t not learn because so much be go on and i ve learn more ability awareness about uh computer the kind of technical side if you like than i knew before but i be more kind of tecchie aware than i be which be really good p role and group just proud that you re do something and like belong to like a team people that be all together no you i feel our city host identity get yeah when you re wear the uniform like you re proud to wear it like policeman well no it s real real reputation be strong pride p i be honour to be the other thing that surprise me be that people if you take the talk time to talk to them and sometimes part of the volunteer because you ve get the uniform on will tell you thing they wouldn t have tell you otherwise cause i think it ing programme it s have be quite successful and people have get use to see u around in our blue uniform and will come good to be part of a and talk to u now p team whilst do my bit enjoyment we have good fun there s a bit of banter most of my work life s be in a factory so i know all about banter i have enjoy the and um yeah we ve have some good fun and i ve work i m work with some nice people and yeah it s just shift and have at a pleasure to be do it to be fair p tend a number of enjoy them all p different event structure routine it s probably do me good cause i m try not to let my study overtake everything so like my whole week it seem a great way distraction end become like i m work uni and then study all over the weekend so actually it s probably just good to to finally get out of put a few shift in and just go self care really isn t it p the house and have i think volunteer be a way of be outside yourself for a while and think about somebody else so if some purpose to my you you need to be away from the situation you re in uh be that you re retire and on your own or if you re week which the pan marry and you just want a break from your partner i think it s good to do some volunteering because it take demic have stop your mind off of your situation p exposure to out we ve do a lot of walk around on the shift so that s always good lot of lot of step most of them door and nature be out in the open air so it s always useful to get out and about p it s nice to actually get out into the fresh air p role demand you could be a leader or you could be a host you could take responsibility you didn t have to p at some event i feel there be one there be one at the coventry cemetery it s good to walk around it and get to see it but then that i do not have you just sit about do nothing there be very little footfall on it the lack the lack of thing to do at some enough to do or that of the event like i say you be just basically present it s not a lot of hand on you know it s a bit boring you i be an extra body come out and spend h there you know it s sort of like watch paint dry p other time i be busy and feel i be help the latter be preferable whelan et al bmc public health page of t able continued theme quote from the interview quote from the survey exposure to culture the richness of what i m learn about the city the opportunity to attend some of these event and so i be amuse by the you know those be thing that otherwise i probably wouldn t attend uhm especially when i wasn t work rich history wonder because if i financially i couldn t afford it p ful people and hidden and that particular one be great because i get to talk to the artist because he be there and actually talk talent that coventry through his different painting and what they mean and also what be happen with them after p have hide it s nice to be involve in it in a way that i can afford to be involve in it if that kind of make sense p table intermediate outcome theme quote from the interview quote from the survey purpose identity and i want to be the person that i be now more look out on life look positive for the future p take me out of my value i ve see people blossom myself include p comfort zone and increase sense of well i d rather help somebody than hind somebody um that might have be not be too apparent open my eye to purpose and mean when i be young p the wider world ing of life you know we ve get this uniform now and i would like to be a part of the city and be able to do to do more really enjoy new develop p the opportunity to sense of identity it feel like i m give back p help my home city expression of altru i m just say that sort of purposeful thing though you know i feel have contribute a little bit p volunteering be a great ism give back opportunity for me to give something back to my home town relationship you know we re obviously the coventry people i ve integrate with the you know hell of a different commu it have be a wonder increase social nity a young community very diverse community p ful experience i feel connectedness i ve meet a couple of people i work with and lose in touch and there they be i couldn t believe it so that that i have a new increased sense of be amaze and one lady i say i know you i know you i know you p family belong feel meeting other people and sort of keep in touch with them so certainly there be people who i have build i have meet some great part of something friendship with like name p people and make a lot i i just think be part of something that be a unique experience within the city for the year p of new friend too we might not all feel the same about the hosting but i think it s bring everyone along the journey and encouraging people to be part of it p be part of a community and not just sit not just sit and do nothing but be be part be part of something you know just sort of say well i be part you know of city of culture i be i be part i be part of it which be what i want p so there s a good sense of camaraderie cause even though we re all do it for unknown reason you know we re all do it for one cause which be for the city of culture p personal growth and i think a a confidence builder it have be it have be good it have be this have force me to try out new i have enjoy be a development thing so i would be less i ll be less fearful for try out stuff in the future p city host a someone increase i guess i m just more open to talk to people p who have autism for self efficacy i think it s have a really positive effect like i say on my wellbeing and so yeah just go out and meet me it have help me increase more people in term of see people and feel good and feeling and i think with my confidence a come more out of my self esteem well p shell increase i would say um so yeah just especially recently with do more shift that confidence have just increase i ve really enjoy it confidence because just through the the kind of experience and the like almost like flood myself with have to be in but i m get a bit those situation p tire now volunteer express in term of their wellbeing how reporting these issue although they may have do for ever there be some very specific negative inci others who do not come forward for interview dent identify which contribute to city host stress city host report several barrier and facilitator to these relate to difficulty book shift and or feel gain the benefit of volunteer these include indi ings of unfairness relate to the booking system some vidual circumstance relate to employment depen antagonism between city host and paid staff in one dent family and medical problem however the city venue which one city host felt be not well handle by host programme offer flexibility for volunteer to city of culture management and stress relating to a spe choose exactly what they commit to and this as well cific event in which the volunteer be not protect from a the general view that volunteer support and man content that be distress to them it be worth note agement be good allow them the chance to volun that even these source of stress do not undermine the teer despite challenge covid be mention by overall positive impact of be a city host for those every interviewee and also by some survey participant whelan et al bmc public health page of volunteering be describe by many a a way of re enter previous study of volunteer engage in mega event ing society after the lockdown and restriction often for example increase confidence expand friend facilitate re engagement and re connection with other ship and bridge to diverse group skill and employ people precaution e g mask wearing and outdoor ability volunteer legacy and pride in city city host shift allow some city host to confidently volunteer also report an additional pathway not include in the despite covid concern table show the key influ theory of change develop by what work wellbe encing factor illustrate by key quote ing in which exposure to culture improve their wellbe ing other study have note that volunteer at cultural discussion event have improve wellbeing and suggest that expo our analysis suggest that take part in the city host sure to the activity which they enjoy play a role in programme be at least partly responsible for improv this and that the exposure to culture be consider ing wellbeing among city host this be in line with the one of the motivating factor for future volunteer wider literature the qualitative data collect exposure to culture be also generally associate with support all the theoretical pathway to good wellbe wellbeing ing in a pre exist evidence base theory of change a key strength of this study be the inclusion of inter link volunteer to wellbeing fig the qualitative view with city host with a variety of personal char data also support many of the theme that emerge in acteristics with the interview guide allow in depth table key influence factor driver and barrier theme quote from interview quote from survey individual so i initially i mean i complete the application last year before the city of culture year be award but there be circumstance some delay with the training because i have to attend face to face training but i couldn t make the slot and then in the end i end up do the online training there be lot of delay in my end cause i couldn t do the face to face train p so ultimately i m have to fit it round whatever work want so i know some people if they be retire they have a bit more time to add to hundred of shift unfortunately i m not in that position p a a i start i get a job so my intention be to be a team leader and because i get work i decide in it you know let me let me first will get priority in the job and see where that take me and so i i haven t take up the role of team leader because my work a a consultant mean that i travel and i can t i can t then commit two thing in the week i can only commit weekend p what volunteer i think sometimes when i volunteer before for thing sometimes when people know that i be you re willing to give it have be a do how much your time sometimes there s an expectation great opportunity and how often they want you to give more and more time if they know that you re free and available that s one of the thing i like although i haven t about this programme it be very flexible and yeah you can fit it around work and family p do any hosting i didn t go for the team leader because i didn t really want the responsibility i just want to enjoy the experience yet i have some rather than get involve with deal with issue you know problem and thing so i just decide to do that city book at the end host p of the week i really like that i could be anywhere i want i could pick any shift i want a much time a i want p um actual volunteer a lot of the time you re not do a lot usually the volunteer like we do in other setting be hand on and more um yeah more go on i m do the vaccine clinic at the moment so we re busy do that but um with the city of culture a lot lately be stand about it might be h it s not not do a lot p volunteer so probably my big sort of like um minus be the be the way that the shift be give out p excellent support support and now the quality of the team leader in the in the coventry city of culture be nowhere near the quality be of the coven from the city host management try ambassador cause they haven t have the training and some of them it didn t even do a shift before they become a team love that team leader p there be specific and i cancel a couple of session and the admin team be absolutely fantastic i do tell them the reason why

long a you let them know because that s the most important thing p within city of culture people say at the start of december they would investigate the whole matter and report back two month and absolutely nothing p i think that they have do well that if there s be a problem they ve try to address it p covid be a tough year from go from be in the office five day a week to go on to furlough

felt unsafe do it i ve always felt you know the right precaution have be in place and at the spe world socialise cially when you re like outside and stuff and in do roam shift that s definitely sort of you know i don t feel like after covid i m in any sort of danger of catch it and to be fair everybody be sensible even do city host shift with various people people sort of say no no we have to do

part in the volunteering pro role in this make city host visible at many event gramme analysis of qualitative data collect through across coventry help to build a reputation and the monitoring and evaluation survey allow u to tri identity angulate our finding with data from a large sample of there be question about whether volunteer benefit city host although also unlikely to be representative of people with a range of characteristic and circumstance city host in general these data support the theme the city host programme allow volunteer to find in the interview data we provide participant match their commitment and activity to their available with the opportunity to feedback on our finding and time and energy this be discuss by many a facili receive positive feedback include one write com tat their participation in the programme as well a ment in response to the draft study report a a city ensure that what they be do fit in with their host i think the overall finding closely track my view wider live this suggest that where other volunteer pro of the programme and anecdotal view from some city gramme can offer flexibility it will promote volunteer host i have speak to so i feel that my view have be for people with a wide range of personal circumstance represent in your research we be aware though that while protect volunteer from burn out this may many city host do not come forward to take part in an reduce inequality in benefit that have be report interview and we do not capture many view of young a a concern in previous work on volunteer at mega city host particularly those currently study at the event local university and city host who be fully train we also note potential barrier to wellbeing ben but do not engage with more than a few shift this may efits of

sibilities for those turn up be something the inter the opportunity to speak about their city host experi viewees and survey respondent be unhappy about ence do not appeal to them a lack of responsibility when volunteering be likely to our finding provide some evidence of what might diminish the intermediate outcome of sense of purpose work well when design volunteer programme and expression of altruism that be need to realise firstly while two key mechanism of change be dis positive wellbeing impact secondly some volunteer cuss below it be notable that qualitative data refer discussed difficulty book on to shift or the percep to every one of the mechanism of change within the the tion that some volunteer be able to get more of the ory of change fig by design a volunteer pro highly seek after shift where necessary consider gramme with every mechanism of change in mind it may how shifts activity or responsibility can be distribute be that benefit be great and felt by more volunteer fairly could reduce the stress cause here in term of key mechanism of change those that be conclusion most frequently mention be opportunity to make social connection one of our study suggest that the city host programme the strong theme arise from our qualitative increase city host wellbeing and that this be achieve data relate to the mechanism of change connect through a number

at enrolment continue this behaviour in late pregnancy by postpartum however one third of these participant have switch to combustible cigarette only with only continue with dual use in this study of

lewis ussher et al a prospective observational study in the republic of ireland report that of pregnant woman in their sample who exclusively use e cigarette and of woman who formerly use e cigarette formerly smoke combustible cigarette kurti et al when we consider smoke reduction as well a cessation one secondary cross sectional analysis study report a similar proportion of woman who only smoke

woman who use both combustible and e cigarette smoke more than one pack a day compare to woman who only smoke combustible cigarette although this difference be not statistically significant mccubbin et al discussion summary of finding this systematic review aim to synthesise evidence publish since about the use of e cigarette in pregnancy thirty seven eligible study present evidence on prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy attitude and perception around e cigarette use during pregnancy association of e cigarette use with birth and health outcome and efficacy of e cigarette a a smoking cessation tool in pregnancy our review indicate an overall prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy of between and although included study suggest that this rate may be low during the last three month of pregnancy when we exclude dual use of e cigarette and combustible cigarette such that only exclusive e cigarette use be consider population prevalence reduce to to suggest that e cigarette be more commonly use to supplement combustible cigarette use during pregnancy than to replace all combustible cigarette use our finding suggest woman who use e cigarette during pregnancy be more likely to be non hispanic white young adult with low education and low income level than woman who do not use e cigarette similarly both woman who smoke combustible cigarette and woman who use both combustible and e cigarette be find to generally have low education and low income level than woman who exclusively use e cigarette study include in this review report frequent expression of concern and or lack of awareness about the safety of use e cigarette when pregnant or breastfeed whilst demonstrate the significant impact of health professional advice on people s attitude towards this issue with regard to health outcome our finding suggest that e cigarette do not pose great risk to parent or infant health than combustible cigarette however it remain unclear to what extent e cigarette be advantageous over combustible cigarette in term of harm reduction importantly the majority of study report health relate outcomes rely upon secondary analysis of retrospective data the gold standard for research in this area be prospective longitudinal design therefore more study use this study design be require to improve the quality of research evidence in this area finally the efficacy of e cigarette a a tool for stop smoke during pregnancy remain unclear with quit rate for woman who use both e cigarette and combustible cigarette appear similar return to combustible cigarette use during late pregnancy or post partum be also report in a number of study in particular in individual who switch to dual use during pregnancy rather than to e cigarette exclusively consistency with other finding the prevalence of e cigarette use in our review be consistent with the finding from a previous review which report a prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy of around to in the usa with a prevalence of below in woman who have not previously smoke calder et al a similar prevalence of of pregnant woman use e cigarette have also previously be report in the united kingdom bowker et al some finding regard pattern of use be consistent with wide evidence in non pregnant population with e cigarette use find to be most prevalent in socioeconomically disadvantage white young adult however a previous review of sociodemographic pattern in e cigarette use find that they be more popular among those with high educational attainment green et al hartwell et al previous research have indicate that pregnant woman generally perceive e cigarette a safe than combustible cigarette especially if they be be use a smoke cessation tool bowker et al kahr et al vickerman et al wagner et al this be support by our review with a general report perception that e cigarette be less harmful than combustible cigarette and be therefore a good option during pregnancy this review also highlight the significant influence that healthcare professional can have on perception in this area previous qualitative research investigate healthcare professional belief and attitude towards e cigarette during pregnancy and postpartum however have identify limited knowledge and a lack of training in this area hunter et al therefore the importance of adequate training to allow professional to suitably advise pregnant woman as well a the general public about the risk and or benefit of e cigarette use be key and should be provide if e cigarette be to be offer a a harm reduction approach nationally and internationally switch to e cigarette can significantly reduce pregnant woman s exposure to carcinogens however nicotine exposure be still an area of concern hickson et al previous study with animal and human have suggest that nicotine exposure alone during pregnancy may have adverse effect in term of lung development function and brain development as well a impact behavioural outcome and reduce birthweight batstra et al dwyer et al holbrook navarro et al nguyen et al although similar birthweights for baby bear to woman who use e cigarette and woman who do not smoke have also be report dhalwani et al as well a reduce risk of miscarriage ectopic tubal pregnancy and stillbirth cohn et al our review reveal mixed finding relate to association between e cigarette use and birth relate outcomes there be report of the same apparent risk of pre term birth in woman who exclusively use e cigarette woman who use both combustible and e cigarette and woman who only smoke combustible cigarette as well a increase risk of sga and low birthweight report in woman who use e cigarette compare to those who don t although rate for both be low in woman who use e cigarette than for those who smoke combustible cigarette this have be support by a recent investigation report a increase in the risk of preterm birth and low birthweights among woman who use e cigarette during pregnancy compare to those who don t galbo et al it be notable however that this study also utilise the pram dataset therefore investigate the same participant a a large number of the study include in this review there be also instance of study report no association between e cigarette use and each of these outcome as well a no association with infant respiratory distress or foetal mouth movement additionally e cigarette use be report to result in reduced toxin exposure however abnormal reflex be report in infant of both woman who use e cigarette and woman who smoke combustible cigarette a compare to woman who do not smoke hajek et al investigate the efficacy and safety of e cigarette in comparison to nicotine patch among pregnant woman the rct conclude that the safety profile of e cigarette be similar to that of nicotine patch however low birthweight g be less frequent in the e cigarette arm of this study versus rr ci p in comparison to nicotine patch this data suggest e cigarette might be an optional treatment for pregnant woman who be try to quit smoke hajek et al and support the use of e cigarette in stop smoking service for pregnant woman previous research have suggest that e cigarette be now the most commonly use smoke cessation aid in england mcneill et al with e cigarette use self report a a key reason for quit smoking in previous study england et al mark et al as well a across the study in the present review e cigarette have also be report to be notably more effective than traditional nrt method hajek et al hartmann boyce et al tong et al however a previous review of e cigarette use during pregnancy suggest no difference in smoke cessation rate between pregnant woman use e cigarette and those not use them calder et al additionally one study include in this review report that whilst e cigarette be an effective mean of reduce tobacco consumption through move from combustible to non combustible product move to e cigarette appear to decrease the likelihood of quit nicotine product entirely high quit rate have previously be identify in woman who exclusively use e cigarette than in woman who use both combustible and e cigarette or woman who smoke only combustible cigarette calder et al notably most woman who switch from dual use to exclusive e cigarette use during pregnancy report return to dual use postpartum whilst some woman who use both combustible and e cigarette also report switch exclusively to combustible cigarette either during late pregnancy or postpartum calder et al this build upon previous report that the majority of transition from dual use to single use in reproductive aged woman involve drop the non cigarette product in favour of combustible cigarette kurti et al these result suggest that e cigarette may serve a a useful alternative to combustible cigarette during pregnancy but that their efficacy a a smoking cessation tool may decrease once the pregnancy have end strength and limitation all section of the review be carry out and report follow international guidance set out by prisma evidence quality be assure by use multiple reviewer throughout key stage of the process and high reliability between reviewer at all stag the review include a large number of study all of which be judge to be of moderate or good quality include study be also conduct across multiple country although the majority of research be carry out in the united kingdom or united state limitation of this review include that we do not search grey literature or consider study that be not available in english many study also rely upon retrospective self report measure recruit postpartum woman who be ask to recall smoking behaviour during pregnancy potentially limit the accuracy of data collect although four study also incorporated biological indicator that could verify self report finding in addition many of the prevalence study include in this review use the same population of participant from the united state use pram use path whilst national difference be indicate in small study with different population implication and conclusion whilst there be increase research examine the prevalence of e cigarette use during pregnancy the effectiveness of e cigarette a a stop smoking tool remain unclear the evidence present throughout this review suggest that stop smoking in pregnancy intervention should support pregnant people to stop smoking both combustible cigarette and e cigarette though exclusive e cigarette use may reduce harm compare to combustible cigarette use or dual use e cigarette use during pregnancy be report to be more prevalent in woman with symptom of depression in homosexual woman and in incarceration expose woman as well a be associate with increased alcohol consumption month before or during pregnancy intervention use e cigarette a smoke cessation tool in pregnancy therefore should incorporate support for depression and alcohol consumption as well a offer additional support for sexual minority it be also important for service to offer postpartum support if they wish to prevent a return to combustible cigarette smoking intervention must also ensure that health professional be appropriately equip with knowledge about the relative safety of e cigarette to effectively advise and support service user more prospective longitudinal study investigate the health and birth outcome associate with e cigarette use during pregnancy be require to improve the quality of research evidence in this area and to allow clearer conclusion about the safety of e cigarette in pregnancy to be draw future study must also aim to accurately measure and account for the role of dual use i e use of both combustible cigarette and e cigarette as well a exclusive e cigarette use when examine association with health relate outcomes more qualitative research be also need to examine the view and experience of people who begin e cigarette use during pregnancy to good identify

evidence base characterize by as long a there be no unified definition and golden standard of low quality due to a small sample size in relation to the amount of measure adherence it make it challenge

importantly what work for self report adherence seem to reflect an overestimation for whom more robust and high quality randomize control trial future study it be recommend to use a combination of

reflect old participant a the a indicate in previous study the nature of adherence be condition be more prevalent among old patient future study should complex but this be not reflect in any of the study except for one address this by focussing on adolescent and young adult population study in which case management and personalisation be offer give the implication of non adherence in term of graft survival and through telemedicine expect improvement of adherence and clinical acute rejection also two study be only focussing on specific outcome from an electronic pill dispenser in nonadherent patient be immunosuppressive drug although this might not represent a unrealistic a they be highly likely to be non adherent to elaborate fully representative sample other factor be representatively pre procedure innovative and well design advanced system that sented across the study such a gender and inclusion of living and include artificial intelligence might be able to tackle this by embed deceased donor as well a the use of convenient sample pre it in a non invasive unobtrusive way into their daily life monitor vent inclusion of patient who be adherent already which happen automatically instead of rely on patient input for example through mostly during the first three month after hospitalization for future wearable could be part of the solution clinician and researcher face study it be important to include a representative sample consist of regard non adherent patient additionally give the fact that adherent and non adherent patient recruit and engage non adolescence and young adulthood brings on it own challenge e g adherent patient can be challenge but can be support through independence autonomy this will need to be take into account into site

implementation science transplantation and resemble a recent review but contribute to remains underutilized with implementation aspect underreported the field through it specific focus on technology base intervention in across randomize controlled study in transplantation for future kidney transplant patient moreover a more elaborate narrative review study it be important to include information at study start on context and critical quality appraisal be present stakeholder sample representativeness feasibility and implementation finally while the majority of the study be focussed on treatment strategy to ultimately support implementation in clinical care context adherence and clinical outcome none of the study assess self to ensure the development and successful long term use of management it be expect that self manage a condition take more ehealth intervention end user and healthcare professional should be time and guidance than be provide by the intervention of the involve from the beginning to prevent a mismatch in need and solu include study with a year follow up period this be also tions there should be reliable internet access device should be pro confirm by one

aftermath of rape sexual assault or abuse the second review combine qualitative study of adult and child survivor of sexual violence and abuse to develop a picture of service user and family member experience of intervention as well a the perspective of the professional who deliver them the review be refer to a publish article that include detailed description of the methodology use study analyse across both review and the finding our finding underscore the importance of access to psychosocial intervention in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse a a range of psychosocial intervention be effective at improve the mental health and well be of survivor in the short term these include traditional trauma focus approach such a those recommend by national institute for health and care excellence nice guidance e g cognitive behavioural therapy cbt and eye movement desensitisation reprocess emdr which show the strong effect for mental health non trauma focus approach and several emerge area such a reconsolidation of traumatic memory rtm trauma sensitive or trauma inform yoga lifespan integration and cognitive training e g neurofeedback although survivor say that they often find intervention difficult they also appreciate that they need to work through trauma which they say result in a wide range of benefit these include positive effect on their physical health mood understanding of trauma and interpersonal relationship and enable them to re engage with a wide range of value life domains survivor highlight a range of feature associate with the context in which intervention be deliver that have an impact on how they access and experience intervention this include organisational feature such a staff turnover that could influence survivor engagement with intervention the setting or location in which intervention be deliver and the characteristic of those deliver the intervention therefore listen to survivor and provide appropriate intervention at the right time for individual can make a significant difference to their health and well be these finding provide support for nhse s aim to provide lifelong support for survivor of sexual violence and

within this strategy service specification identify the core service that should be deliver within sarcs include assessment fmes and health and well be intervention nevertheless sarcs in england vary considerably in the type of organisation that lead them the staff member who work within them and the care and support service that they provide sarcs be far differentiate base on whom they support with some provide care to adults some to child and others to survivor of all age within this context we know very little about how staff experience this work and it variation although we do know that this work can have an emotional toll furthermore while rate of access to sarcs in england and service user characteristic have be report elsewhere understand about survivor experience of sarc service have be limited one small study report that sarcs be experience a a safe haven calming and welcoming and where survivor felt support and understood in light of these gap the first aim of this study be to identify key issue and concern associate with the work of sarcs their workforce and the use of technology sarc service delivery be severely affect by the covid pandemic which also witness shift in the type and incidence of sexual violence and abuse give that our research coincide with the covid pandemic period we be able to examine the effect of covid pandemic on sarc service delivery and document the innovation that occur these finding be report elsewhere sexual assault referral centre act a an initial point of contact therefore it be vital that the care and support provide to survivor of sexual violence and abuse be of the high possible standard and that there be continuity of care beyond sarcs sarcs in england sit within a large and complex network of organisation and professional that reflect the widespread need of survivor at different stage receive referral from these organisation and professional and refer sarc client to them while inter agency and inter professional collaboration have be explore for some year across profession such a social work knowledge regard collaboration across professional in the saas context be limit a small amount of relevant research have be conduct in the usa but only one example have be describe in a european context and none in england furthermore survivor perspective have be largely absent in this research therefore a second aim of this research be to explore the integration of sarcs in the broad context of a health and community response to sexual violence and abuse draw on perspective of both professional and service user stakeholder method study design overview the main component of this study be a process evaluation of sarcs a process evaluation be broadly recognise a a method that seek to understand the work of an intervention how that intervention be deliver and it effect alongside contextual factor that may affect outcome in complete this process evaluation we undertake qualitative investigation of professional and survivor voice regard sarc service delivery and integration of sarcs within the saas pathway from the mapping of all sarc site in england we identify several diverse site to undertake

approach when explore a new intervention or service however when it come to apply normalisation process theory to our data the service staff and integration of sarcs be not newly implement therefore we seek an alternative theoretical approach to capture the importance of effective integration between different organisation and professional and draw upon theory relate to inter professional collaboration theoretical approach bronstein s theory of interdisciplinary collaboration have be apply extensively across other field and in two study explore integration within dutch and united state u model of sarc provision coordination and collaboration have be hypothesise to be link with the effectiveness of sexual assault response team in the usa these study point to the theory s relevance to capture interdisciplinary collaboration and integration for sarcs in england bronstein define interdisciplinary collaboration a a process that facilitate the achievement of goal that can not be achieve by individual professional bronstein s model comprise five component interdependence newly create professional activity flexibility collective ownership of goal and reflection on process interdependence refers to the dependence between and reliance upon different professional in work together to achieve their own goal and requirement newly create professional activity be collaborative act program or structure that can help achieve more than that if undertake independently by professional flexibility capture deliberate act of role blurring in which professional work together can achieve great efficiency and effective work collective ownership of goal relates to a share responsibility among professional to achieve goal with a commitment to client centre care finally reflection on process relates to professional acknowledge their collaborative role and evaluate how to effectively achieve and strengthen these relationship bronstein argue that inter professional collaboration can be affect by several characteristic include professional role e g clear and well defined role structural characteristic e g manageable workload personal characteristic e g how collaborator perceive each other and history of collaboration e g prior experience of collaboration previous research have highlight challenge to inter professional collaboration for example perceived power imbalance and different professional focus orientation between staff member these challenge will be explore in the context of this research sample recruitment and participant we map sarcs across england use data collect from sarc manager through an online survey site return data and sarcips data we produce a data set which allow sampling of site for the qualitative process evaluation and the cohort study see chapter use this data set we recruit a stratified random sample of seven sarcs from all site with stratum define accord to service delivery model police lead nhs lead charity lead or

data result overall and a set out in the qualitative data present in chapter survivor identify access sarcs a a positive approach in their recovery journey recovery journey be rarely linear or uniformly positive but survivor relay that their encounter with sarcs and other specialist service fulfil what survivor want from service and professional in the aftermath of abuse in light of the experience of professional as well a those of sarc service user the following section explore key issue concern and strength associate with the environment and organisational characteristic of sarcs

participant the emotional support information and option present and the referral make sarc staff try their hard not to cause me any more distress of course there be distress and it be uncomfortable but not their fault the fme be an extremely demanding experience and for one participant akin to have a post mortem while you be still alive isva support which may be provide directly through sarcs be also highly value particularly in relation to practical support through investigative and criminal justice proceeding and the technique to support recovery counsel increasingly offer through sarcs be consider a largely positive experience although wait list to access counselling and the restriction on the number of session mean that some survivor felt i be get somewhere and then it have to stop i didn t think it be good enough that it stop another core function of sarcs be access to other service sarcs open a range of referral for client however drawback be i be get bombard with a lot of people call me i have five or six agency call me the day after my phone didn t stop ringing and the consequence of this a i have to keep go over and over my story it be highlight how survivor find it

sarc team work creatively to ensure that their service could accommodate the range of need of client from different community locally include those whose access to service have be delay non linear or complicate by different factor one police officer demonstrate reflection on process in how they work with their local sarc i attend the sarc a lot because if there s be an operational issue even though it may be north of the county i will get invite and then sarc manager and i and others will sit down and go ok how can we deal with this what can we do go forward to make sure that this doesn t

and they saw a role for be a point of contact for survivor of csa and informing survivor about option for report and referral to isva and third sector support sarcs express that effort should be make to address public perception that sarc support mean police involvement they demonstrate how self referral to service be foster and also note the ongoing difficulty for self refer survivor in term of physically reach their service in some area of the country by contrast those who report to the police be usually transport to sarcs by police officer sarc staff operate in line with trauma inform care professional be keen to see that choice be exercise in key area such a report mechanism a note by this crisis worker i think it s really important to allow people that opportunity to validate what s happen to them to try and re balance regain some power in a situation where they ve felt powerless and to have that choice staff highlight the long term storage of forensic data and anonymous submission to police intelligence a an underutilised service in term of people s access there be widespread endorsement of anonymous location and for site where survivor can provide alternative reason

response to the covid pandemic have the effect of mitigate some of the geographical barrier affect survivor access to sarcs and isva care many survivor also identify a preference for remote contact with provider feel more relaxed and that the distance of a telephone call be well for me when talk about difficult topic who be the sarc workforce across service delivery model staff roles generally see at sarcs be sarc manager deputy and an administrative member team crisis worker and fmes fnes flexibility in role at sarcs be common my role cover a lot of area for example manager and administrator train a crisis worker depend on the degree of integration at the site isvas enact their role in flexible way a core staff at a sarc employ by the voluntary sector but co locate at a sarc with largely visit remote role or base physically at a voluntary sector organisation thus many model could be draw upon to suit the landscape for example some sexual health service have isvas nhs sarcs tend to employ clinical staff directly whereas private sector sarcs make great use of staff bank with sarcs increasingly offer short term psychosocial intervention counsellor be also integrate into the staff of sarcs frequently on a part time co locate basis finally several role be note to lend themselves to specialisation with some site train crisis worker and isvas to specialise in the care of particular group for example cyp individual with learn disability within the scope of the current research we focus on two prominent workforce issue the nature of the crisis worker s role and related training and challenge to effective interdisciplinary sarc team the crisis worker s main purpose be to support client of the service however the role involve a diverse range of task and balance the sensitivity of case and need and expectation of vulnerable client with the constraint of what can be provide one morning i might be help with a forensic medical and in the afternoon we might be do call ups for email enquiry and reach out to people that have access that way i think it s an incredibly difficult role to learn if i m honest because it s so varied and wide there be some repetition within it that be very quick and easy to learn but there s other stuff that make it much tricky like around geographical location so understanding what service be purchase in relation to paediatric fmes in a geographical location which mean that if somebody be ring from name of city and they want to come in do we see them or not or there s understanding and learn what the service offer outside of the area as well a in the area crisis worker without prior experience of the region crisis worker practice might suffer train vary from across site with most involve formal learning component for eample safeguarding and a period of shadow my first client interaction that i shadow it be kind of a steep learning curve because it s not like anything else crisis worker shadow and train more broadly be note to be variable and rely on standard set by provider the crisis worker s role have not attract much attention within the research literature beyond the toll it place on individual an issue also recognise in our research while the role be consistently value by service user for whom the crisis worker be the first sarc professional they encounter i find it helpful that i receive emotional support from the crisis worker when i get there because it be scary and go with the police survivor professional participant view the role a lack incentivisation e g opportunity for progression when a client or when a victim be at the sarc and you ve got private company who run forensic service and you ve get the police and you ve get a crisis worker surely all three agency should be work together because we re support that one person sarc manager meet the client s need be a shared goal for staff at sarcs and there be frequent reference to we be quite a tight knit group

of sarc role on call zero hour contract staff employ by different provider a crisis worker participant contrast the scenario of where fnes be employ directly by sarc and the experience of work with fnes fmes contract on an on call basis the other doctor you only see them every now and then so you don t really build up the same rapport with them and obviously they all work slightly different try and suggest the way that you would do it normally just to try and make it easy and quick because obviously we want to put the victim first so we want to make it easy for them i do think that it s so much good when you work together implicit here be that place survivor first require effective team and staff who be familiar with each other and the setting while all participant agree that consistency in staffing be important for team working and reduce isolation flexible contracting be desirable for some professional balance other livelihood and commitment sarc manager do have particular concern about crisis worker in this regard crisis worker do an amazing job but i think they do just feel a little bit disconnect from the service despite the workforce concern that be voice across the staff member and sarcs include in the study we find very high level of intra sarc interdependence particularly among crisis worker and fnes there be strong recognition of the importance of clear communication and inter professional respect support each other to reduce the impact of their work and a commitment to provide an integrated service to the client simple example such a gather information from their client together and share information between professional a appropriate benefit client in not have to repeat information or re tell about their experience and evidence newly create professional activity collective ownership of goal in pursuit of client centre care represent a key aspect of effective interdisciplinary collaboration reflect the impact of this care one survivor comment i felt safe with the doctor i felt safe with crisis worker name who be in the room i didn t feel that anything bad be gon na happen what be the technology that enable sarcs to get work do this section focus on two key issue use of remote digital service in provide care and challenge emerge in information sharing across the service the advent of the covid pandemic meant that sarcs use digital technology to facilitate service delivery include triaging of client before they attend the sarc staff report that they carefully determine the appropriateness of remote care for different client some benefit to triaging be realise in that client spend less time at the sarc once they arrive survivor report both positive and negative response to the increase use of digital technology highlight the need for develop remote service a part of a suite of option and tool the second key issue relate to information share different it system for different organisation mean that sarc staff member spend considerable time make manual referral through online system or secure email system which add considerably to workload i refer a lady to adult social service because i felt her need would be meet with social care provider but i couldn t go direct with social care provider i have to go through adult social service and they have to make the referral and i be tell on that phone call that somebody would be contact you and today i ve not have a contact and it s be about two week so that s something that i be go to have to chase up so that be quite time consume isva this work describe by one sarc staff member a their nagging work be frequently highlight with regard to share information with partner organisation survivor experience interruption or delay in access to onward care i haven t receive any care i get tell i d have sexual health screening that hasn t be sort or anything i have to go to the doctor s about get an examination do they be suppose to help sort that out but they didn t survivor nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no to what extent be sarcs embed within the overall response to the need of survivor of sexual violence and abuse the most important external partnership for sarcs include the police sexual health isvas third sector and social care for example our data suggest well establish and collaborative relationship between sarc staff and police officer single point of contact officer in police force work directly with sarc manager to develop pathway for survivor and training by sarcs to ensure police officer understand local provision and access collaboration with third sector organisation be more challenged with any multi agency work we all seem to work parallel with each other quite often and not come together at the top to deliver crisis worker there be a strong sense that collaboration be drive by individual senior member of staff at the sarc and or the partner organisation and involved local implementation positive relationship at senior level trickle down and foster positive cross work see to ultimately benefit survivor example of cross work include co delivery of training and sharing of resource and space professional express a wish for change for some implement a more consistent sarc model be the answer with more service under one roof such a integrated isva and sexual health service others recognise exist high quality provision in these area within their community and that pathway and relationship should be strengthen another example be achieve best evidence interview with some believe these should be conduct consistently at sarcs while others saw sarcs a a place solely for acute crisis care and consider that survivor may not wish to return to these location participant point out that sarcs have all evolve in different way in the community they serve and in express how the sector need to develop in the future emphasise the need for simplification and good approach to support client with complex need the role of sarcs be vital but there be real concern about the invisibility of sarc service survivor rely on the police and others to learn about sarcs i wouldn t have know about them if it hadn t be for the detective survivor in response to the lack of public awareness about sarcs there be several example of team initiate outreach service in their community often target group see to experience even great barrier to receive help e g men minority community gap in knowledge about service provision by sarc extend to important professional group there be so many more people that need to know about the sarc crisis worker gps be identify a a professional group lack awareness of sarc service with referral from gps be infrequent this sarc manager talk about the difficulty of engage with gps probably in defence of gps they have just get so much demand on their time and they don t have free time so we ve put on training event especially for gps we do the open day we try and target gps some of them be just not aware of what we re do they re really out of date the information that they be give client from the perspective of a survivor gps have get such little understand they don t take it in and then they re like we don t know who you can speak to they just don t know what the right support be discussion summary of main finding this work highlight the excellence in care and support be provide within sarcs a such the value of sarcs in the provision of care and support to survivor be support the contribution of sarc provision to the care pathway extend beyond provision of forensic service importantly fulfil an early role in coordinate care for survivor however this research also document the challenge that sarcs and the saas sector a a whole experience in address survivor need draw on interview professional survivor and survivor responses the novelty of this qualitative enquiry be evident in the breadth of participant span both inward and onward referral route as well a sarc staff themselves along with the voice of survivor in share about the care and support they receive

process evaluation of sexual assault referral centre in address the first aim of this work finding have highlight key issue and concern associate with the work of sarcs their workforce and the use of technology in do so this research document the high level of dedication of sarc staff and capture their commitment to client centre care and an ethos consistent with trauma competent practice this commitment of professional at sarc be far evidence in their response to the covid pandemic where they effectively utilise technology to ensure that care could be continue while enable great flexibility and choice for survivor appreciate several distinct role be involve in produce the range of care and option for survivor our finding emphasise crisis worker a vital to a survivor s care journey at sarc attention to the crisis worker role be fundamental in further develop the workforce of sarcs we find evidence of effective interdisciplinary collaboration span across bronstein s five component of interdependence newly create professional activity flexibility collective ownership of goal and reflection on process both within sarcs and across the sector despite be hamper by the complexity of how different service be contract sarc staff work hard to achieve cohesive team and ensure that an excellent service be provide for their client we saw many example of work that reflect good quality inter professional collaboration specifically inter dependence and collective ownership of goal in deliver client centre care matthew and hulton call for research to identify whether there be a link between effective sarc collaborative practice and survivor experience of sarc service this research answer that call with our finding show high level of effective inter professional collaboration find between sarc staff specifically between crisis worker and fmes fnes and subsequent positive endorsement of sarcs by survivor however there be factor that can hamper inter professional working within sarc setting the way in which professional role at sarc be commission can lead to short term team and unstable working hour of staff whereby collective ownership of goal in pursuit of client centre care be difficult to achieve in comparison consistent team enable strong inter professional working and evidence best practice this generate culture of transparency and respect more compassionate support and offer a high quality experience of care for survivor across the sector and move beyond the sarc set the second aim of the research be to explore the integration of sarcs in the broad context of a health and community response to sexual violence and abuse in do so our research give a positive picture of interdisciplinary collaboration across the wider sector across criminal justice health and third sector organisation professional across these sector clearly engage in collective ownership of goal in recognise the importance of effective and cohesive care and support for survivor this run counter to u research where research note cross system coordination be non existent or lack consistency with subsequent challenge to the effectiveness of sarc provision and integration however barrier remain primarily in the form of inefficient communication system for share information effective information share system be highlight a be critical to enable strong inter professional working and importantly contribute to efficient work practice reduce the workload burden of sarc staff however this study have demonstrate challenge to optimise the access to and fully realise the benefit of sarc service specifically relate to the invisibility of sarcs sarcs need to be more apparent a a care option for those in crisis particularly if the person experience rape sexual assault or abuse recently this include wide community awareness e g family workplaces friend of survivor give pattern of disclosure in personal social network it be paramount that public awareness of sarcs be prioritise for example through investment in public awareness campaign this be particularly important for group of survivor who be underrepresented at sarcs and experience barrier to access them nhse make effort to address this problem with a campaign in target specific group include black and asian woman men and survivor from lesbian gay bisexual transgender and or queer lgbtq community with a focus on youth across these group a broad campaign be also run in south east england target all age nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no strength and limitation the study s originality resides in the breadth of the experience bring to bear on question about the role and effectiveness of sarc service with input from sarc professional and stakeholder outside of sarcs as well a the voice of survivor who have access sarcs in england while prior work have explore aspect of the work capture this study benefit from the large scale nature of data collection which allow triangulation of experience of multiple informant there be important gap in represent those inside sarcs medical examiner the study also lack gps and social worker two professional group that be integral to early intervention in sexual violence and abuse implication for health care enhance the visibility of sarcs among professional the finding highlight the need for awareness raise work to be continue and far develop in reach survivor across all part of england however gap in awareness of sarcs specifically highlight in gps critically need to be address for example current heavy gp workload may mean that more traditional method of awareness raise in professional group at a local level will not be effective instead more thought should be give to develop collaborative relationship at high level e g integrate care board british medical association general medical council royal college of general practitioner with a clear pathway to facilitate gps and sarcs to develop local collaborative relationship in summary survivor need to be able to make informed and empowered choice about their crisis care and thereafter professional be able to signpost survivor to sarcs provide survivor the option to benefit from specialist knowledge and referral pathway at minimum our finding also suggest that the physical visibility of sarcs need further attention for example walker et al recognise a need to balance accessibility and discretion in locate sarcs valuing and develop collaboration in other word strong collaborative relationship between sarc staff and other agency translate into high quality care and support for survivor a highlight in the national service specification sarcs be a mainstream provision link to other care pathway and must achieve strong partnership across health and social care the specialist sexual violence and abuse service in the voluntary sector and the cjs however the effectiveness of this collaboration and partnership be affect by two issue firstly the nature of relationship between sarcs and their partner organisation frequently rely on individual relationship building bronstein highlight personal characteristic a a factor that can strengthen inter professional collaboration where professional who view each other with trust respect understanding and engage in informal communication can engage in much more successful collaboration we interview many professional who exemplify this good practice in the way in which they work with other individual this translate into effective and efficient work that assist over burdened service delivery however the sustainability of these benefit be threaten by staff change decision maker may want to consider how relationship between agency can be develop sustainably secondly inefficient information share substantially increase the workload of professional there be a need for significant financial investment which simplify information share uncover a bestwhile it be unlikely that a simple solution exist decision maker need to consider how it interfaces between organisation could be facilitate and also promote reflection on review of referral pathway process that may be unnecessarily complex this be particularly key give that it have an impacton survivor when their care be disrupt delayed or stop due to issue with information share the commissioning process for sarc staff and the contracting of sarc service and service in the wider sector do not always support staff to collaborate effectively we consider that a secure workforce should be an aim for commissioner in this area our work have not uncover a best practice model to achieve this e g one sarc model of staff that should be promote and we also recognise copyright o doherty et al this work be produce by o doherty et al under the term of a commissioning contract issue by the secretary of state for health and

specifically the process between organisation with a view to simplification and to reduce barrier that aggravate workload recommendation for research give the gap in include informant from social work and general practice future research could examine the specific challenge these professional group perceive in participate in a community response to sexual violence and abuse furthermore while this research have identify excellent practice in relation to collaboration continue research attention be need to evaluate these practice to ensure that this capture the complexity of how sarc service be deliver both nationally and internationally overall we hope to have highlight the dedication and creativity of staff deliver client centre care and support in the saas sector which be reflect in

health and well be in a british sarc population be the first to follow up health and well be outcome in adult cohort and be one among the small number of prospective longitudinal study internationally involve survivor of rape sexual assault and abuse it take access to sarcs a the starting point for the cohort it aim to describe the health and service use journey of survivor in the year after sarcs and examine how the mental health need of survivor be meet in voluntary sector and nhs setting the study use a multilevel model framework to explore risk factor for burden of ptsd symptom at baseline and reduction in symptom during the year after to determine whether sarc service model and subsequent care influence outcome and to identify whether participant level factor moderate outcome method study design overview the study design and method have be publish in a protocol study this be a cohort study of mental physical sexual health and cost outcome over year in adult survivor of rape sexual assault and abuse who have receive care through sarcs in england quantitative measure be implement at baseline week after index sarc access and at and month post baseline the study also gather qualitative response at each time point relate to quality of care recruitment commence in september and the last month interview be conduct in december change to protocol the main deviation from the protocol v be that loss to follow up be even great than anticipate we interview only people at month instead of the projected people we do however reach the target sample size at baseline our cohort underwent several change before v to cope with challenge to recruitment and these be tabulate in the study protocol briefly the most significant amendment to our original protocol be reduction in the target sample size from to and reduction in the follow up of year to month each due to the difficulty reach a trauma population the covid pandemic trigger a change in inclusion criterion eligibility no longer require service user to present in person at sarc service and we also begin to admit self referral into the research a oppose to require referral by a professional early consultation with our ssc and leg see chapter after the study launch lead to addition change in measure for example we add assessment of eat problem suicidality self harm drug use and capability we also change the minimum age for entry into the cohort study from to year because care pathway be different for those under year and it be see a a good approach to focus on young people separately see chapter

health and well be of survivor after access sexual assault referral centre sample recruitment and procedure use data supply by nhse and base on our process evaluation study see chapter we divide all sarcs in england into stratum base on service delivery model size and level of integration of service next we randomly select site from stratum and approach them to participate in line with our plan site recruitment sarc site join the research we also recruit of their onward referral partner mainly isva service because the primary recruitment model rely on referral of sarc service user to research by isvas the requirement to recruit this number of sarc referral partner be unanticipated we intend to have more of the major sarc sit nationally where isvas be employ by sarcs and deliver care on site and therefore make referral to the research more seamless however several of these site be already participate in another nihr fund study recruitment of individual be undertake in three phase the first involved sarc staff screen service user for eligibility people be consider eligible if they be service user at sarc aged year and have present in person at any of the participate site after march the research welcome survivor who access sarc service remotely as well a self referral these be participant who have not necessarily access one of the originally recruit sarc sit the main implication of this be that we could not collect service use data about participant from those site in most case we ask the participant for the information where appropriate and safe to do so e g what date do you access the sarc who be the perpetrator of the offence return to the main model of recruitment people be exclude by service if in exercise their own judgement the responsible member of sarc staff conduct screening anticipate a service user may be too unsafe to participate or may encounter difficulty in provide informed consent due to severe mental health cognitive or learn problem we also exclude those who be incarcerate a conduct follow up assessment in prison be outside the scope of the project sexual assault referral centre staff complete a screen form for all those age year present to the service record basic demographic data and offence and referral characteristic and indicate whether the person be eligible or not with any reason for exclusion indicate these screen form be assign a study identification number contain no identify information and pass onto the project team to provide an indication of the characteristic of the pool of service user pre enrolment sarcs routinely refer on to other agency and nearly all survivor be offer access to isvas thus our approach be to train isvas work inside sarcs and in the voluntary sector to invite their client refer from sarcs to consider join the research we co produce recruitment material with our leg e g video which the isvas share with their client isvas gain consent to pass on the person s name and phone number and preference for safe convenient contact to the research team study identification number be pass on not only from the sarc to the research team but also from the sarc to isva service thus when a person consent to be in the research we be able to link the person to the service data we hold this minimise the number of question include sensitive question that we need to ask a trained project team member establish contact within week of receive the consent from the isva or sarc or in a small number of instance other recruit site setting such a sexual health and contact be make in line with service user preferences once contact be make by the research team we follow our recruitment and safety protocol explain the study purpose and gain full consent see chapter when consent to participate

important both cross sectionally and for within person change a nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no this study involve neither

group difference we would expect that separate an effective treatment from an ineffective one base on guideline we anticipate this mcid of sd to approximate to a point difference on the pcl change score however stefanovics et al propose that an sd base approach be more robust and we also recognise that the magnitude of change on the raw scale metric would be influence by the length of time

amount of available data the miss at random assumption on which the maximum likelihood approach to miss data be pin not to mention the more ubiquitous multiple imputation pertains to beliefs about the difference between responder and non responder something that can not be refute use the observed data alone nevertheless it can be helpful to investigate relationship between pattern and missingness and both model variable and auxiliary variable this research use a string of zero and one to describe missingness pattern for example be attribute to individual with all miss data for pcl be attribute to those who miss the final wave and be attribute to those with complete data when study the observed data we have gatherd some evidence of an association between pcl score and missingness but the pattern be far from clear our a priori belief might have posit that those with more severe symptom at baseline would be less likely to remain in the study this be not what the data present for example

experience of sexual violence give the limited literature focus on the economic evaluation of service and programme to address sexual violence and abuse the study provide useful data to inform decision making in this area the main limitation of the analysis be the level of miss data on resource use and qol at all time point accordingly multiple imputation method could not be employ because of the extent of miss data and a complete case analysis need to be undertaken exclude those who do not complete the resource use questionnaire at all timepoints may have introduce bias and some level of inefficiency the bias may be base on the finding that certain group include more disadvantaged group be more likely to be lose to follow up furthermore among those who be retain the resource use section of the interview be the section more often omit by field worker in situation where the person report lacking time or that the interview be too difficult for them to complete in this sense the study may have underestimate service use caution be also need in interpret the level of service use at baseline while it cover a period of approximately month median be day there be a high variability in the timeframe between sarc access and the baseline interview another limitation be that the follow up be only for month which may not have allow long term impact to be fully captured recommendation for research the data collect in the study suggest that participant need to access a wide range of healthcare third sector and other public sector service there be a gap in understand about the extent

our theoretical approach be underpin by the united nation convention on the right of the child whereby all child have the right to make their voice hear in matter that concern them while have the right to protection from harm and exploitation we recognise the importance of ensure that the research do not lead to child experience further harm in light of the potentially long term and wide range detrimental impact of experience sexual abuse during childhood while not want to exclude cyp from the research opportunity the approach be also inform by theoretical development in the sociology of childhood view child a those able to make meaningful contribution towards issue that affect them rather than be object of enquiry thus research with child a have be acknowledge in inter relate field this study be underpin by critical realism acknowledge that individual or society socially construct independent world and there be different yet valid perspective about reality critical realism

could approach at any give point in time some cyp be quickly enrol into the study while it take longer to enrol others recruitment challenge also relate to the service landscape of third sector

s experience of sarcs child and young people have positive experience at sarc acknowledge it key role in enable holistic care through conduct fmes provide medical care that provide reassurance and offering referral to organisation for further support many cyp tell u that they do not have prior awareness of what a sarc be until they disclose to a trust individual and report to the police one young person have prior awareness through social medium where they have learn of others experience of what sarcs be like i have hear of it before i get most of the information actually from tik tok where others be all tell their own story but both good and bad i would say my experience be good than a lot of the one i d heard of serenity child and young people report that although they have be anxious when they first attend the sarc the staff make them feel comfortable and welcome at the start i felt a bit nervous i didn t obviously know what be go on properly i didn t really want everyone to look at me but then by the end i felt a bit more comfortable ben child and young people appreciate sarc staff communicate clearly to them before and throughout the fme they explain it very well what be go to happen like the whole swab and how it s go to work she say to me it s not go to hurt but you might feel a little bit uncomfortable aurora i have a full body examination do for bruise and mark i have a couple of std test i have another internal examination for bruise on the cervix they d show me what they be use and they let me know every step of the way what they be do serenity child and young people value have opportunity to make decision during the fme they give me the option for the support worker to stay in the room as well like behind the curtain to talk to you to distract you so that be really good that help somaya the sarcs in our study be base in hospital and the cyp have mixed opinion about how suitable this be some appreciate the hospital environment a it provide a

kind of turn up to the sarc it make me nervous because it just give me hospital prison vibe i think i would give it more kind of homely i know obviously they have to be like professional and medical but i don t know if there be something more kind of welcome lola child and young people highlight the importance of be able to take literature from sarc home that they could read when they felt in a good place to engage with it they also value receive a care pack it s like a massive relief the way they tell me that i can go home with this really good quality stuff and i could relax myself i could clean myself serenity the service provision landscape after sarcs child and young people believe their recovery be impact by the service landscape in which support service be provide post sarc this lead to many experience continued poor mental health and further trauma symptom long wait list for counsel delay cyp access support some suggest that time spend on wait list could be well manage by service so that their mental health do not worsen one cyp have be present a an example of this there be this lady that would call me once a month when i be on the wait list that happen or time and she send me workbook they have lot of quote powerful message and activity to do like name thing you ve achieve since what happen to you get you to think about positive i find them helpful lola some cyp describe how they access support through digital apps which they engage with at their own pace particularly while wait for counsel cyp often find these apps themselves and think they could help them manage physical and mental health impact associate with their trauma for some long waiting list for counsel from third sector organisation lead to them start counsel provide by their school however this still have it limitation i think they say that it would be a long wait i think it be like a year and a half however the school give me counsel but they couldn t be very helpful because i be in my last year and i didn t know the counsellor and i didn t even do that for long because i be in the last year of school somaya those who have positive experience of support often felt that it duration be too short this be particularly difficult when cyp have develop positive relationship with those support them cyp felt frustrate about be unable to share detail about the abuse with their therapist when their case be go through the cjs thus long wait list short term support and criminal justice guidance impact their health and well be child and young people felt that there should be considerable financial investment into service to educate people about sexual abuse and support those who have experience it i think there need to be more funding put into recovery group for people who have be through this kind of thing people who have be through this kind of thing need a way to rebuild their identity and give them that sense of community more project that work around the stigma of boy who have be sexually assaulted project to educate people and then project to help rebuild people and their self esteem after this have happen clara copyright o doherty et al this work be produce by o

could very much trust them they be very patient with me they really understand how it be for me serenity one young person explain how a staff member in school work with a third sector organisation to ensure she have a safe space to engage in virtual therapy session during school hour work together in this way enable her to receive support seamlessly cyp highlight the importance of joint work within education setting particularly when the topic of sexual violence and abuse be part of the school curriculum the well be officer be message my teacher for me she be like oh she s feel a bit like this today maybe not do this or maybe not pick on her as much in class like don t get her to put her hand up all the time she help me to work with my teacher especially a i do health and social and we have to learn about sexual abuse yolanda many describe the critical role of their chisva who provide them with update and explain criminal justice process because of their good relationship with other organisation such a the police cyp felt that their chisva fulfil their role a their advocate however cyp tell u how there be missed opportunity for support even when professional try to work with other agency i remember there be one time i be with my detective she casually say in conversation oh you should tell your social worker this this and this and i be just like what social worker and she be like when i set up your case i arrange for a social worker to be in contact with you you should have have one from the start i be like this whole time she think i have a social worker because she have say to them you need to go do this and nothing ever happen clara child and young people emphasise the importance of inter agency communication by professional follow a disclosure of sexual abuse aurora share how her teacher respond by follow safeguard process but it be not communicate how quickly her parent and the police would be notify obviously know about the whole sexual assault she teacher couldn t keep it to herself and i think that she have to call safeguarding and obviously safeguard have to call the police and then she call my mum about it i know that she would have to tell someone because obviously i m under but i didn t realise it be go to be like super super quick aurora child and young people value healthcare professional work together so they do not have to explain their experience of assault multiple time somaya share how the sarc communicate with her gp but a the gp do not acknowledge her sexual abuse when prescribe her medication this lead to her feeling a though the gp be not concerned with her overall health nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no sarc have tell my gp it say on like my history or something now they just kind of without question sort of prescribe the medication like they could have ask me and give me the option and like try to check my overall health or try to like support before prescribe i don t know like if they maybe like care about my overall health rather than just be like oh this be for you somaya child and young people expect professional to work together to help them build their support system by signpost them to other local service range from housing to sexual health however cyp and their parent sometimes find it overwhelming and confuse when many service contact them at once thus cyp recommend a more joined up approach between organisation principle underpin a trauma inform approach child and young people s heal be influence primarily by their experience of interact with professional cyp provide example of positive interaction and one that felt damage cyp describe the following principle that can be see to be promote in trauma inform approach to support survivor feel empower through have choice and control feeling empower through have choice and control be important to cyp a the abuse have take this away from them this involved professional make them aware of opportunity where they could make decision one cyp appreciate make decision about how they make contact with their chisva for example if their chisva send them a text message they could decide when to reply without feel pressure to respond immediately cyp also report that have option about how they could engage with service face to face or remotely enabled great accessibility within therapeutic setting cyp value flexibility and option in how they communicate their feeling often in creative way which could also be use a a tool outside of the therapy room i think it s sometimes when you can t find the right word for something sometimes just like an image can show that and portray that rather than describe it in detail lola a part of feeling empower cyp value clear communication particularly while navigate the cjs a lack of communication often lead to cyp feeling a though they be not value there would be like month where i wouldn t hear anything which be obviously very natural but there would be thing go on behind the scene and i don t think sometimes that information be pass on soon enough cece not be judge or blame child and young people value interaction where they do not feel judge or blame for the abuse this be convey through what professional say and how they communicate just be able to know that you can go to someone with your problem and your feeling and just know that you re not gon na be judge for it and they re here to help you bel child and young people describe example within criminal justice process where language come across a blaming or judge them a lot of the letter i felt be blame it on me basically at one point they just say there just wasn t enough evidence and i be happy with that but then they go on to sort of blame me and be like you could ve they go on to say like you didn t basically i didn t seem upset enough sophie copyright o doherty et al this work be produce by o doherty et al under

that the police interview wouldn t be the same a the small talk at home it be the same guy that come round to my house that do the interview and he be completely different and it be really formal they be act like i be lie because of how they be ask stuff but then he come round again to our house and he be lovely again and he be like we want to let you know that we believe you it be all fine but obviously in that moment it be so different lola be treat a a whole person child and young people emphasise the importance of be treat a a whole individual particularly by those provide therapeutic support while they want to be understand for what they have experience they do not want to be define by the abuse it be important that their resilience and strength be acknowledge even when they be

when i m struggle and when i m not sophie child and young people value service treat them a a whole person through the way in which they promote cyp s actual and felt safety such a provide them with taxi to access the service ideal characteristic or quality of professional child and young people identify key quality that they believe professional should have all stem from the principle identify by cyp which could be describe a trauma inform while cyp felt that professional could be train in these they recognise these could be inherent quality within a person which should be consider when recruit professional into job role empathy child and young people say that professional should listen and show empathy not just in their word but through their body language cyp felt they could distinguish between those who show authentic compassion and those who do not experience genuine empathy and compassion have a long lasting impact for cyp it s like everything from the tone of voice to the body language to the actual word that be speak you really just have to show it it s those people skills it felt comfortable and friendly whilst also give that professional level of support she s one of the big impact on my life i will never forget her clara however there be damage implication on health and decision about pursue justice when empathy be not convey the way they would like look at me sometimes or the way they word it it make me feel like be this really all worth it just simple thing like look and phrase lack of communication it twist the mind especially after these event you overthink a lot and it s dangerous for some people serenity provide a personalised response while cyp recognise that professional have high caseloads they believe this should not compromise genuine

felt like i be talk to a friend clara child and young people value professional tailor support and be creative in their communication particularly if they have a disability when support be not tailor

silence for age at a time it be really awkward i could never get anything out i never felt welcome there it just never help serenity a part of this cyp felt that the type of therapeutic support

describe the negative impact of professional or system not consistently show awareness of the wider context in which abuse occur particularly in relation to the cjs this system isn t very inclusive it s not very accessible and a lot of ethnic minority and young black girl be subject to sexual violence at a young age and you have people in the system who don t understand those background don t understand the sociology behind them and how they end up be the victim of what they be i think it s just lead to a lack of justice be provide there s not an understanding of the life of the people

quite quickly yolanda recovery be ongoing child and young people explain how their healing be ongoing and this be not the same for everyone cyp recognise that there be time point when they felt ready to start receive support and time where they do not some felt tension between not feel ready to engage with support while be afraid that support may no longer be available if they do not take it up although cyp know their right to access support at another point some felt unable to ask for that support again if they have previously refuse it cyp also highlight the significance of be prepare for formal support to end and have a sense of closure a part of their recovery we really get on and then it sort of feel a bit like a break up that you re never gon na see her but then when she send the

sarc motivate them to engage with opportunity where they could be hear some support service provide cyp opportunity to participate in a consultation group once formal support end where they could influence service delivery this enable cyp to remain connected with service and make change for others child and young people tell u that they felt motivate to participate in our research study for a number of reason because of cyp s positive experience with service they want to ensure that others receive positive support i feel like my motivation have just be to help others when it happen i be in a very down place and i m now a much happy more creative just independent person now i want people to know that it s not gon na be like horrible for the rest of their life polly for others negative

kind to explore cyp s experience of sarcs and their journey post sarc our finding demonstrate the uniqueness of recovery in this group of survivor recovery be influence by how quickly cyp accessed support it content and duration the location and context of care and how well service work together healing be also affect by life event that cyp experience which include sexual re victimisation re exposure to abuse serve to aggravate trauma symptom and undermine engagement with service child and young people have positive experience of sarcs and value their role in offer them a fme and connect them with onward support service a the majority of cyp in the study do not have prior knowledge of sarc this raise question about sarc awareness among young population and the importance of professional awareness of sarcs when respond to disclosure of sexual violence and abuse among the majority of those we speak to sarcs played a role in respond to recent sexual offence which rely on cyp disclose abuse in light of the cost to the nh of delayed disclosure of sexual violence in childhood and lifelong impact for survivor it be paramount that professional be prepared to recognise and manage disclosure effectively child and young people felt that their recovery be impact by the limitation associate with the broad service provision landscape of service access post sarc access delay and short term support be the norm there continue to be an urgent need to invest in resource for service to minimise the negative health and well be impact for young survivor that be exacerbate by not receive timely and long term support our finding support other research that have show young survivor manage their own mental health and well be while wait for support while adequate resourcing of service may take time cyp in the study suggest that there be benefit of service manage wait list time such a provide psychoeducation child and young people identified principle that be key to their recovery which could be describe a principle underline a trauma inform response to support survivor recovery outcomes not only be dependent on timely support but be also impact by cyp s interaction with professional at sarcs and across sector include specialist sexual violence service statutory health education social service and the cjs thus trauma informed principle and certain quality associate with professional such a show empathy and compassion not judge cyp provide a personalised response and empower cyp all play a role in cyp achieve long term gain in the aftermath of sexual violence and abuse these principle and quality reinforce key message from our qualitative evidence synthesis see chapter about what factor impact survivor engagement with intervention and recovery

some of the problem of access to service with the voice of young participant from black community and diverse cultural community of individual with physical disability and of boy and young men largely miss in this study there be also limitation in represent sarc service with only two paediatric service involve we hope that reflection and learning from our qualitative study of diverse adult survivor see chapter can speak to some of the risk and access issue affect member of subpopulation miss in the current study implication for health care it be paramount that a trauma inform approach be adopt across universal and specialist setting a professional may unknowingly interact with individual who have experience sexual violence and abuse therefore attention should be provide to equip professional through train a delay to receive support can negatively impact cyp s health and well be urgent investment be need to resource service adequately in addition service should consider way to manage opportunity while cyp be on wait list for therapeutic support which could be beneficial to their recovery there be also a need for great education about the role of sarcs and onward support service among any professional a young survivor may interact with to build cyp s support network recommendation for research involve group that have be under represent at sarcs be vital to gain increased understand ing about barrier to access support and how service can be tailor to well meet need further research need to distil what trauma inform practice mean in different sector and

victimisation exist our research take the position that all participant be believe with full understanding of the role of be believe in survivor heal and recovery people s story be not construct within a vacuum this form of narrative enquiry enable the participant to share their experience in the order of importance that matter most to them this also enable the researcher to look at the whole

treat a them by institution make up of u e g inadequate policing response to a report of a rape by a gay man or by a non english speaking migrant woman many people who participate in mesarch would say

by smith we conduct indwell ing the notion of become familiar with the story through multiple reading and also thinking of each participant a a person with a story to tell we identify the big story those that take time to tell contain substantial detail and reflection over major life event or experience and small story the mini side story that people tell in relation to everyday thing within the transcript next we identify narrative theme or pattern run through individual story by attend to what be repeat and significant for the story teller use colour cod for different theme and make note in

date or a decline e g go from have high hope about get justice to a notification about the case be close by the police with little explanation follow by the conclusion of support from the isva smith also include a series of guide question to extend the dialogical narrative analysis far for example identity question how do people tell story about who they be or who they may become and function question how might this story or tell it be useful to the survivor narrative analysis attend to the particular by look at the data a a coherent whole to achieve this we create core story for each participant in the embedded qualitative study critically maintain the participant s own word throughout and remove extraneous material we move fragment of theme together and integrated event into a temporally organised whole with a the matic thread the final step in our narrative analysis be for the four researcher and two live experience group member to move from story analyst to story teller through the co production of compos ites this involve the researcher reading and re read the core story and identifying and discuss common theme plot and thread across the core stories we examine these theme plot and thread for linkage with our research question as well a allow these to emerge in ductively e g connection between cultural background and risk we cluster story or theme within story tack together section of participant story and importantly retain the soul of the narrative p typology of narrative arise from the study that communicate the central point about the oppression barrier gap and opportunity discuss by participant we share story and create composite that emphasised temporality and captured common theme in survivor journey of recovery and heal give the wealth of

first time it be kind of say to me that there s not much point you report it to the police because of how low the conviction rate be although obviously conviction rate be really low and we see it every day i think that completely put me off report it because i felt well if they re even say it what s the point kind of thing but even if nothing happen report it mean a file be open i wish that i be support more with the whole police thing because by the time that i report it in i didn t have any evidence on me so it couldn t really go anywhere but if i have supply stuff back then because i do

address this complexity see box physical or visual reminder of the abuse or the abuser another feature of narrative focus on the lack of recovery of the participant be relate to be remind of the abuse visually one example of this be where a participant describe move back to be near her family hop for their support with care for her child only to be confront with her abuser again see box for another participant smartphones send reminder of old photo could cause flashback participant face many situation not necessarily unsafe situation which serve a reminder of past abuse and could trigger a response and obstructed recovery i be recover within the narrative there be story about the long and ongoing process of recovery many people talk about have achieve some sense of recovery or have make progress in that direction there be a sense of hopefulness that recovery would come and that a range of factor be identify a important or link to the process for example move to get away from the location where an assault box programme for spot perpetrator i remember someone at some point say about some course i could identify red flag or predator and i just think wait what why do i have to do that work i think he be my friend like nothing about him give me the impression that he be a predator they re imply that you re some kind of idiot who just let predator in your door i just remember think why do that programme even exist like why be we make woman sit through these programme that make them feel like they re stupid for have let this person into their life because actually predator be really clever and they find way to do it it s the men we need to work on they re the one who need to go on the course pause we can work out which one be the predator and put a sticker on them they re the problem not u i just yeah i remember when they offer me that just be like hello box deep trauma identify a too complex for a brief time limited therapy you know these week not even week week course you know i don t know how they expect someone with trauma to get everything out in those week you know because you re only in there for minute and by the time you re settle in and ready to talk and something come up they ve get to leave for me it just stir up a whole bag of emotion just spin around like a washing machine there s many part to my personality now that i just don t understand i don t understand me anymore i don t know i just i mean my day be get short and short because sometimes i suffer insomnia as well through the night you re go over what have happen and the event so consequently during the day i might want to have a little sleep and i can actually sleep in my chair sometimes my energy level be completely bust i just don t do very much i get up eventually i have a shower by the time i ve do that i m exhaust come downstairs have something to eat and then i need another rest because i ve do that i ve exert myself do that i think i m a burden on everyone i think sometimes it will be simple if i wasn t here and they could get on with their life and not have to worry about me sometimes you know because i live with chronic pain every day sometimes you just think why you know why do i have to live like this nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no box return to the location of the abuse and see the abuser again my first marriage break down and i go back to the family village where i be bring up back into the pit of depravity i suppose think that would be a good move with my two daughter because my family have show some kind of interest in help me which didn t happen i be out of they be in control again and i wasn t in control of my own life or my child s life so the depression get really bad obviously this family member who have commit the abuse when she be a child be in the village as well so i bump into him quite often and i d have this slight numb effect whenever i well if i saw him i wouldn t ever speak to him or you know be near him if i could help it i d turn and go the other way or do something like that but just the image of him and that s like flashback all the time place smell thing like that they re all trigger it take you right back to time that be hard that be difficult for me have occur be identify a helpful and be link to the narrative about be remind of abuse or the abuser above people also talk about their effort in engage with the internal process of tackle mental health problem and a grow sense of passion for seek justice and see justice a part of a big societal picture have good support from others in their life be also important people also discuss various type of physical activity or exercise a be helpful for recovery justice and it relationship with heal for many survivor of sexual violence and abuse there be no court process a many case do not pass the threshold of evidence require some of the participant have have case where the justice system be involve however and that be play an important role in their recovery see steve s narrative in appendix box for others there be a sense that get justice be part of an important statement about the wider issue of violence against woman and sexual violence and abuse in society it s not just my battle to fight either it s not just about me and my body that he actually strip of dignity and it be just so atrocious but it s actually an offence against the state there be a sense that people be put life and recovery on hold while wait for their case to go through the justice system a illustrate in box struggle with mental health problem and get support everyone describe the impact of their assault on their mental health and well be and generally struggle with the ups and down a part of the recovery journey get the right support could be difficult example from some of the narrative be provide in box and one participant describe a sense of a mismatch between her body and her brain while try to recover from her experience of sexual abuse and assault she describe some of the lasting effect include the impact on her ability to build relationship make decision and get into drug take see box box court case hold up the recovery process i have desire to travel i have desire to do these thing but i m aware i ll have to be in the uk during this time i d like to have my own community and support around me during the time i definitely put thing on hold i be a kind of person who would always want adventure and to do these fun thing and i m just the kind of person who be like do like the safe most stable thing possible i d love to get to a point where i feel okay to take risk and i feel okay to do the crazy thing that i use to do and know that i would be able to like fall back on myself and that like i ll be fine so that s my aspiration the journey i m on at the moment i think because i have this investigation i have court date that type of thing it s very much like split in the back of my brain i haven t really felt it and that work really well for me and i m go to have to deal with it formally in the future and i think it s a really good idea not to think about it beforehand so my approach have be for the whole last year erm uh back of the brain don t think about it deal with it later and that s okay i think like it s go to be shit down the line and then i m go to dig it out and then it ll be fine copyright o doherty et al this work be produce by o doherty et al under the term of a commissioning contract issue by the secretary of state for

since then i ve suffer with anxiety and depression just constantly it s alright at the moment but i wouldn t say it s the best and i wouldn t say it s the bad i felt that it have massively affect me it s affect my mental health to this day it s almost two and a half year since it happen but it still affect my mental health today i try to do talk therapy but what they instantly want to do be not trauma therapy but behavioural therapy cbt for the anxiety and the depression so i just cancel that because they could never actually solve what i be actually think of and go for the trauma i m still wait on the trauma therapy they say they d call or email me when it s available i ve have no email and i ve have no call but i ll still wait for that one box experience of pre exist mental health problem i ve be in therapy for about year now the medication have it ups and down try to find the correct um like counsel that you need to do and kind of thing but it s be quite good and very supportive my mental health in the beginning follow the sexual assault wasn t a bad because i be kind of convince myself that nothing happen it wasn t that bad because i be quite intoxicate when it the sexual assault happen i be try to convince myself every possible way that it wasn t what it be it be fine then it start to give me really bad flashback and ptsd on top of my already severe and anxious like severe depression and anxiety that i ve have i be unable to leave my room i be trap in that room for a very long time i never have like i have never have good sleep like just with it mentally i m do a lot well i still get the help i still have all the contact if i need any help but i m do a lot well box mismatch between body and brain and impact on decision make the frustration for me be that it feel like my brain be somehow stick in the past but also like well it s just not quite match up with my body my body s tell me something like you need to rest now and i m still so restless that i need to kind of pace myself or do excessive exercise or i m so tired that i just stay in bed for day and day on end my body s tell me one thing my brain be tell me something a little bit different sometimes and i ve find that mismatch to be quite challenge i ve find that when you ve be in a life threaten situation where you be tell to perform sexual act and you do it then it s very difficult to avoid coercion in any kind of future relationship and control because you ve be in that situation i win t go into the detail of date of assault but it be over a forty eight hour period it make you lose confidence in your own decision making i ve find decision make quite hard even just basic decision making and then you let other people take over and i guess that s why i get into the drug scene briefly use mind body connect activity a therapy e g yoga meditation a number of participant whose narrative align with have make some progress in recovery and who have hope for recovery talk about have find various form of mind body connect activity and physical activity a helpful include run marathon yoga meditation and art therapy excerpt from their story illustrate this be provide see box accept that recovery be a process and there be ups and down another feature of story that convey recovery express a sense of hope for the future and an acceptance that recovery would take time and include both good time and difficult time these participant want to keep work at their recovery journey example of these hopeful narrative be provide see box and supportive partner and other relationship the importance of positive supportive relationship in recovery be discuss by most people in particular new partner feature within people s narrative see box people often talk

the yoga s actually really really helpful it s just i ve have the same teacher it s i get it free because i m on benefit but it s through those wea course online they re really good but the tutor s very very good and um yeah i think it be i m find that quite helpful um yeah i think mostly feel safe box exercise yoga meditation and journal keep have help sometimes i get like not flashback but just like vivid memory really or thing will just make me think of stuff and i will have nasty nightmare about stuff that happen so that could definitely kind of give me a wobble i feel good i have like ups and down it feel like hard work sometimes to stay okay but i have lot of thing i do and way of manage to cope and just to generally kind of keep me feel okay and it really help i think a lot of it have just be the way i think about thing i think i never think of myself a a strong person and it help me to realise i be i just kind of be able to like feel that in my body and think i be strong just kind of help me i exercise regularly i run and do workout yoga meditate and keep a journal they re all thing that kind of help me feel okay or help me if i m not feel okay box run marathon and set personal goal have help the complaint and that aside i ve be okay i ve try to find my focus again in thing that i enjoy i like run triathlons and stuff like that i ve set myself some pretty big goal for this year it s to help me focus and give me that sense of purpose to be drive towards a new achievement which have really help in my recovery i don t want or need pill to make me feel well i just want to celebrate what i can do be the very best i can be i m do a half marathon two marathon month apart and in between i ve get a couple of event already book a half ironman in july which will be amazing a i ve never do anything as crazy a that before i be keep myself busy with all these challenge and that be what drive me to become a good version of myself box art therapy have help i end up have art therapy with specialist provider of sexual violence support service in the end and they be really really good i think after the sort of initial experience i be a bit wary bring up the dissociative identity disorder a a main issue and i figure maybe i could work through it without that be at the forefront of the therapy i could do the work outside of the session a well and so if i have anything that i didn t maybe i think she wouldn t understand or i i didn t want to bring it up then i could do that outside so we do the session on zoom so if i want to then i could show her the work or email her photo and thing the collaging be be my favourite i have a real aversion to watercolour because i find them difficult for a good artist to paint with but we work through that which be really cool we start do painting because i ve always be quite afraid of mess so that really really nice to overcome that i think it help with the do because it help personality that express themselves without necessarily need to speak particularly when i didn t have anyone to speak to so that be really useful in those alone time but it help with everything as well box continue the recovery journey and working at it i just wan na continue on that journey and be a little bit more stable a little less emotional i don t know if that will ever happen for me because these be thing that affect your life but i d like to contain it a bit more and for me i know what the end goal be i want to work you know once i have go through all i need to go through because there s a lot i ve get to unpack i want to help other people like me i wan na work in a child s cse child sexual exploitation home i want to help other people and turn my misery into something good i m currently in the

learn to accept that i d say everything in my life have change since the assault but it still be not something i ve forget thing will remind me of it it s hard than i think it would be to brush those moment off i ve move away from uni by design to get out of that environment but like it s still with me mentally and i guess it s change the way that i kind of carry myself and i know that although i be do really well on my anxiety before that then after that it s just be like a massive spike and i ve have to build from there again i m definitely not heal from it i don t know if that s anything in my soon future um i think that i m happy to like openly accept it like say it happen and like if it s like in conversation like i m not go to shy away from it um but i think there s still part of me that feel like if i have do something different like it would have never happen i know that s not how i should feel but but yeah i think thing thing be start to change and i think one of i guess the big tool in that be social medium i ve find a lot of helpful resource which be surprising but i would say i m hopeful that everyone s well equip box the care of a supportive partner but then i meet my ex and he be a really gentle person and i actually think that be a huge part of my heal journey actually i think it be one of the most significant thing that happen to me be get into a really loving kind nurturing patient relationship with someone who be just when it come to thing like consent he be all over that to feel like i d meet someone who know despite his flaw and the reason why we break up like make me feel like i have like autonomy again of like what i be do box relationship with child have be a powerful source of help my son i m very focus on him he s do really well i m so proud of him people say you re a single parent you do really well for yourself and he s thrive as well those positive word to hear that from other people be really uplifting it s me and my son in the future and he s my rock he be if i didn t have him i probably wouldn t be here today i m also very grateful that i didn t take my own life those year ago a i wouldn t have achieve any of the thing i have do so far move away lastly in relation to those in the process of recovery participant often refer to have to move away from the location where the assault or abuse have occur to aid recovery this map onto to similar comment about barrier to recovery see i can not recover above box provide example draw from three narrative of recovery box i need to get out i m leave i try to make the area and the flat where assault happen a place where i could feel happy and reclaim that space but actually what i realise over the month be that i wasn t able to do that so i do need to vacate i would say that be the kind of real crash well more like a sense of right i really do need to get out because be in the area be just haunt me when i vacate which be in march so six month later i get to the point of breakdown with post traumatic stress and flashback and then that escalate into psychosis and be really really unwell despite all the effort to maintain my mental health i keep go to recovery meeting like various sort of twelve step meeting online mental health group so i be check in at every turn but then there do come a point where i think right i just need to get out i m leave box not able to move but try to change thing i didn t move i do want to move but finance obviously don t allow that so i ve have to literally change the d\u00e9cor of my house everything to try and avoid the reminder i ve basically redecorate move everything around of that side to try and basically forget it it still hasn t fully work but it s at least something i be still hold out hope it s just that i might try again with the doctor and ask for therapy or see if i can go private nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no box move away provide space to process thing a i grow up i sort of carry on at the mental health service at school as well and at university and then eventually manage to move out of the family home where the abuse have take place so that be a huge step in term of be able to process thing in a space of safety i think have that safety mentally sort of allow load of repressed memory to come up that s when i realise i want and be able to get help properly i start by approach name of sarc that help me access specialist provider of sexual violence support service and they be brilliant they be really really helpful i also later on go to provider of isva service i feel recover for some participant they be able to tell a story of more complete recovery they still express experience of trauma and have be on a journey but felt that they have reach a positive place that they could call recovery in addition to the factor describe by those participant above additional feature of these narrative include commentary about recent societal progress in talk about sexual violence a further range of therapy and support and get good consistent support from a range of source see table societal progress talk openly and online help one participant talk about the experience of a grow openness in society to discuss the issue ofcsa and find this very helpful for recovery see full core story in appendix box similarly the growth in online information to support self help and learning be identify a beneficial by another participant and a source of empowerment see box what work be different for everyone what be noticeable about the narrative we gather from participant be how every person s path to recovery differ in addition to the commentary about meditation yoga exercise and art therapy outline above other helpful therapy and strategy include emdr see box spirituality and religion forgiveness see box and a type of visualisation meditation see box consistent support from all source a final feature of the recovery narratives among those who seem to feel the great sense of recovery be the consistency of support they have receive from a range of individual and support box access to information a powerful tool for self help i don t think i would have recover as well if i didn t do my own research and my own self help but obviously the internet can be a dodgy place and you can end up make yourself feel worse but i think try to increase my self awareness around what happen to me and the effect like read into the complex ptsd side of thing and stuff constantly work on yourself have really help me get to where i be today because what i be like after that incident compare to now be two different people and like i say it wasn t because of therapy or anything it be a lot because of my own work that i put into it i think have sort of good resource online and stuff be really helpful box emdr help i end up have emdr therapy through it be free so it be through the nh it be great to have access to that it change my life completely absolutely completely change my life since my emdr therapy i m fine to talk about everything it s not a problem really nowhere near as much a it use to be after the first session it be really difficult and it buy up all the memory again that you try and forget but the way they make you that your brain sort of start work instead of be like this trigger me you know you see it out and about and instead of trigger you you think of yeah there s that thing you carry on with your day i don t fully understand how i do it they talk you through you know you ve talk through a particular scenario not even the bad part of your experience it could have be any part and you just let your brain take you where it take you it be really strange after two or three session see that particular scenario that you go over and over see how your brain change i be already feel so much difference that therapy it be before the covid pandemic so two and a half year ago and even still i feel okay copyright o doherty et al this work be produce by o doherty et al under the term of a commissioning contract issue by the secretary of state for health and social care this be an open access

access to sexual assault referral centre among racially minoritised box forgiveness help that be also sort of a similar time when i decide that i be go to forgive my dad and i call off the police investigation and actually i just manage to close quite sort of that chapter and start work on the forgiveness and forgive my mum as well and have more of a relationship with her so for my mental health that be definitely the best thing i think outside of the space create by church there be so much encouragement and rightfully so for people to come forward to report these thing to make sure that justice be serve and that we get justice for what s happen to u i feel maybe a teeny bit guilty say it because i know that other woman struggle with the come forward but for me it s be so much easy and so much more valuable to actually just let go of it and forget about it and i know that s a privilege that i have that other people don t have but for me it s be the right thing definitely box visualisation meditation help my mental health team drop me after the trainee leave but luckily there be the spiritual lady i don t know what else to call her she do thing alternatively like visualisation technique with you basically it be like meditation understand that i can distance myself like if i m with a group of people and i don t feel comfortable at any point if there be any action word anything like that i can still pour love to those people without empty my cup like you be allow to have connection from a distance you re allow to take two minute to yourself when you re sit in a group full of people and you know you re suddenly in a panic or a whirlwind you re allow to sit there and just go sorry guy i m just out of this conversation for a minute um and just visualise yourself it s thing like visualisation like light come from your foot up to your head like just your inner lightbulb where you re protect and no one can hurt you service this be illustrate in steve s narrative see appendix box positive skilled response from a range of people support organisation and the wider system can contribute to a sense of strong support even when criminal justice proceeding be slow or non existent there s a sense of share the burden within these narrative such that the recovery and heal journey be not do alone but in collaboration with range of professional and agency with family and friend and with colleague and community discussion summary of main finding our analysis of the participant narrative data have be present across three different typology we identify narrative relate to narrative relate to risk of experience sexual violence and abuse access support in the aftermath of sexual assault or abuse and narrative relate to recovery align to lack of recovery progress in recovery and hope for the future and feel a sense of recovery we purposively sample people from minoritised and underserved community from our wider cohort study and include a sample of people from outside of our cohort recruit through third sector organisation to include voice of those who have not access support through sarcs these analysis likely represent the large scale qualitative investigation to date of the experience of such a diverse range of minoritised group experience and journey in the aftermath of rape sexual assault and sexual and domestic abuse our finding highlight the fact that recognition of what constitute rape and abuse may act a a barrier to seek help and that many form of sexual violence and abuse can occur in a complex web of community and family norm which serve to hide the abuse and create additional barrier to seek help and support include the opportunity to escape from abusive domestic situation the health and social care workforce need to be culturally competent in understand when they might need to ask question and to do so in safe way disseminate information about how to access support in safe way to people in all community who may be suffer or at risk be need to support good access nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no professional also need to be train to be confident in intervene when a victim survivor may not feel able to take the first step but they be in danger in simran s story see appendix box it be clear how the structure of the system inadvertently act in a discriminatory way to block her and her child s access to safety justice and the right support to recover there be additional experience share that draw out the positive of a lgbtq focus response and the potential negative influence of intersection of social disadvantage old age and pre exist mental health condition can have together these serve to highlight the need for outreach and service that take account of these characteristic this be particularly pertinent where we have evidence that some minoritised group may be at great risk of sexual violence it be interest that although we do not set out to explore risk of victimisation our participant present narrative around risk in addition to the risk of re victimisation that experience abuse can bring the risk narrative also draw out some of the ethnically and culturally minoritised experience of people for whom that characteristic be relevant risk include the taboo nature of discuss relationship and sex and deeply entrenched patriarchy as well a cultural practice such a forced marriage and honour base violence change in societal and therefore professional understanding and attitude towards victim survivor of sexual violence be cite by participant a helpful in relation to both access to support and their ongoing recovery journey there be recognition that people be more open to talk about this issue than in the past and a great tendency towards believe survivor and aim to be trauma inform accompany this societal change be burgeon information available to people on the internet which be include in one of the recovery narrative of our participant the availability of online information and psychoeducation for support can empower survivor to take control of their recovery journey continue pervasive societal norm that act in support of perpetrator behaviour be also cite however a detrimental to recovery journey h ence our data reflect helpful societal progress but the need to continue to push to far this empowering and supportive agenda these finding align with recent discussion in the academic literature about the need to understand good the structural and social cause of sexual and domestic violence in our attempt to prevent it and support those who be victim of it there be challenge identify in relation to access the right kind of care with many of our participant talk about unsuccessful attempt at therapy and inadequate offer of care that do not suit their need ultimately our narrative where there be hope of recovery demonstrate a level of acceptance that recovery will be a long road and that a range of different therapy and mind and body connect activity such a yoga and meditation may be useful for that process these finding reflect those from our two cochrane review to some extent which provide emerge evidence of benefit from less traditional intervention and therapy such a trauma inform yoga see chapter of this report similar to our qualitative cochrane review which find that intervention lead to a wide range of benefit the narrative of our participant show recovery a have a range of different outcome that they view a beneficial include reduction in anxiety and flashback and the ability to engage in activity that they enjoy do such a physical activity and volunteer narrative of access and of recovery encompass the particular challenge there be for those who have complex trauma to deal with these be often individual who have experience a number of ace include abuse and neglect who have a pre exist mental health condition and who may be experience domestic as well a sexual violence they may have be victimise many time and be at risk of re victimisation they may also have child to take care of service be not set up to provide the tailored bespoke multi faceted and multi d isciplinary care that survivor with these pattern of abuse need the narrative of our participant show this poor response to complex case be

library and the doi of the publication must be cite access to sexual assault referral centre among racially minoritised strength and limitation large scale qualitative inquiry into the support and recovery experience of survivor of sexual violence be challenge to accomplish a strength of this study be that it have achieve the collation of detailed narrative of these experience from a large sample of sarc service user as well a survivor who have not access sarc the sample likely represent the most diverse to date in term of it representation of cultural linguistic and ethnic group it include people of different gender and sexual orientation and a range of age and level of socio economic status and education it highlight the hope there be for recovery across these diverse group but also the gap in support that exist for those experience complex trauma and from the most underserved community a further strength of this study be the way it complement the more traditional cohort and health economic analysis of outcome value multiplicity of knowledge and give weight to experiential knowledge it inclusion within the research process have create opportunity for epistemic justice where silence or marginalised voice be amplify a one participant put it i want to really have a voice because i felt in other area when i be speak up before about how i be feel it be get diminish or just ignore we acknowledge that a limitation be that we reach far few participant from non sarc support context than intend those we have reach provide detailed narrative and provided insight into the complexity of intersect form of marginalisation how these interact with sexual violence and abuse risk and the nature of barrier to service access this part of the study far illustrate the resilience of individual and community in the aftermath of abuse and the creative and personal way in which people navigate life after trauma implication for health care health and care and support service have an important role to play in the recovery of survivor of sexual violence and abuse get a good response from service matter and can contribute to good recovery the response of wider society matter too though e g see our whatareyoudoing campaign and effort to improve cultural and societal norm that may contribute to sexual violence and abuse and create the context for recovery be need as well good outreach and training for staff to support those still in abusive environment to escape abuse and get support be need support for those experience complex trauma history multiple victimisation with complex mental health and personal circumstance be also need to avoid exacerbate health inequality and meet the need of the most vulnerable survivor recommendation for research future research should focus in more depth on those with the most complex need and who do not make it to care through sarcs give that minoritised group be often least likely to access support in the aftermath of sexual violence via sarcs it be not yet clear whether sarcs be the best care option for all nihr journal library www journalslibrary nihr ac uk doi ctgf health and social care delivery research vol no chapter discussion this section overviews the key finding from across the mesarch project study consider limitation of the project overall set out overarch implication for sarcs and for health care more broadly and make recommendation for future research main finding give the breadth and complexity of this year project we have present the key mixed method finding accord to a typical sarc pathway pre sarc a primary focus of this research be to understand what promote or deters access to sarcs through share their personal narrative and experience participant shape where and when their story start with most of them take u far into the past this lifespan lens underscore how for many survivor risk for sexual violence and abuse begin early in life this risk be reinforce by power dynamic connect with race gender socioeconomic status religion sexuality and disability show by our research team and others our qualitative study identify gender base violence root in gender inequality a a risk factor especially poignant among the racially minoritised community sample of non sarc attendees another theme concern silence we gather widespread account of risk arise from a lack of early education and everyday discourse about relationship intimacy and sex when sexual violence and abuse do occur the milieu of customary silence render survivor voiceless and unable to draw on otherwise

of the culturally diverse participant silence and shame about abuse be ever present in narrative irrespective of time place or people s background the absence of tool for talk about abuse and seek

this occur in a context of long term mental health problem which include substance misuse among the most minoritised participant in our sample a central tenet be that trauma itself be a risk factor

exposure to sexual violence and abuse while behind every number there be a person and the research have examine individual level response just four individual report sarcs have be harmful to them this be the low rate of harm detect across any sector in this research our sarc process evaluation emphasise the importance of cohesive regional partnership between sarcs and multiple statutory and voluntary sector agency this be also observe and articulate by survivor with regard to their satisfaction with on site care referral and follow up we view sarcs a a vital gateway to recovery and it be often survivor first encounter with care in relation to sexual violence and abuse a such it be crucial that sarcs provide a safe individualised response that facilitate the person to continue on the

the isva service a professional to advocate for and support survivor through the criminal justice process depend on the local model some survivor continue care with a sarc provide isva for others they be refer to an isva provide by the voluntary sector isvas be integral to an effective pathway and for the most part survivor do not report difficulty access isva service and adapt during the covid

isva fall to at year in line with the reduction in open case from to participant express difficulty when isva care be withdraw in response to case closure and there appear to be variation nationally in the extent to which isvas can be access or maintain independent of criminal proceeding the problem of access be much great in relation to counsel service in the voluntary sector capacity issue do

back to gps who be often see to be ill equip or unwilling to support mental health need of survivor formal mental health expertise to identify and support mental health concern remain limited within the sarc skill mix the mimos project find that staff lack clarity about pathway into the mental health service together with high threshold for accept service user and long waiting list a we do with sarcs we explore survivor experience of harm and benefit in different sector post sarc the finding from the voluntary sector service replicate what we find for sarc a median of suggest that half of the people rat maximum benefit score across a rich landscape of support provision for survivor the median score for the nh be with a notably high proportion of survivor indicate that they experience a harmful response from the nh coping and recovery for survivor occur in a justice context and while this study capture widespread evidence of positive action police and justice lag considerably behind in it harm benefit profile while of participant indicated benefit score more than a quarter of the sample indicate they derive harm from their interaction and experience the whole investigation process have be just as traumatic a the abuse or in another way bad while health care and other support service have come a long way towards provide safe effective and compassionate care for survivor society continue to grapple with it poor performance in meet justice need while an in depth discussion of finding on these aspect be beyond the scope of this research the next section distil some of the key finding on the factor influence recovery effectiveness of sarc pathway for survivor of sexual violence and abuse central to our endeavour be to understand what impinge on outcome for survivor there be many outcome assess in the cohort study here we summarise the quantitative evidence for a reduction in trauma symptom ptsd base pcl a our primary outcome complement by survivor voice on recovery journey people enter the cohort study with a high trauma load score above the diagnostic threshold for ptsd there be strong evidence of association between ptsd at baseline and past trauma burden e g ace health profile chronic mental health problem and socioeconomic factor e g economic deprivation the study also find weak evidence that sexual violence perpetrate by partner family member and people in position of trust aggravate ptsd and there be a small effect of time since trauma more time to sarc more trauma detect at baseline at year the sample a a whole have achieve a mcid mean reduction in point sd however be still above the diagnostic threshold there be no evidence for difference in ptsd at year relate to model of sarc service delivery participant have access i e charity police nhs private sector provision cost utility analyse also identify no significant difference in cost per qaly gain between these different model of sarc service delivery similarly we do not detect an effect of the isva model i e sarc isva or non sarc isva although intensity frequency of service use be associate with trauma at baseline we detect no effect of level of service use over the year or do we detect an effect of harm benefit from the police justice response on the ptsd outcome thus the only predictor for ptsd at year be the baseline burden of ptsd which have be show to be strongly determine by several well define pre offence characteristic and to some extent non recent sexual violence and abuse and proximity to the perpetrator our research also suggest that those with the high trauma at baseline have the great improvement furthermore while those with four or more ace have twice the odds of probable ptsd at baseline t his reduce or at month and effectively be null or at year it would be promise if month of care and support could dilute the effect of the ace profile show clear parallel with our study khadr et al report base on a study of young survivor that the presence of

receive widespread endorsement from survivor practitioner and policy maker limitations one of the key limitation relate to the composition of our sub study sample which reflect the challenge of conduct research with survivor of sexual violence and abuse while recruit isva third sector service and rely on them to refer survivor to our research for our adult and child s study be the most optimal approach to u and enable the research to be conduct safely we do recognise that commitment by site be highly variable recruitment challenge mean that our adult cohort study sample size have to be re calculated and revision be make to the study protocol we also acknowledge that our adult cohort study do not have a control group non sarc population for comparison which limit a conclusion that access to sarc and other health or therapeutic care explain the reduction observe in ptsd we could reach participant from a non sarc population in the narrative study these participant provide detailed insight into their experience of service but the number be low although we capture a large number of survivor beyond medico legal service sarcs through our cochrane review good support one key limitation of our primary research be the lack of applicability beyond sarc setting and user and it be know that most people who be victim of sexual violence and abuse do not access sarcs the study be deliver through the covid pandemic and have a number of implication the covid pandemic impact the extent to which service be able to commit to support the project in it recruitment of service user due to the demand on service and the workforce furthermore the covid pandemic change the landscape of service provision and there be difficulty in disentangle what support participant have actually receive from sarcs importantly we have to adjust the inclusion criterion for the adult cohort study to include remote service use when our intention have be to only recruit those who present at sarcs in person this will have likely influence the research in way we be yet to discover for example it be conceivable remote model dilute potential benefit of the sarc pathway copyright o doherty

access sarcs in england there be limitation associate with the data we collect in our process evaluation we be unable to gain depth in respect of forensic integrity and equipment a be beyond the scope and expertise of the team yet this be recognise a a key issue for the sector and criminal justice journey an important and novel contribution of our cohort study be to gather comparative data on the experience of benefit and harm across several sector we face challenge in how to best measure perceive harm and benefit of service a part of a telephone interview the approach we use be highly subjective with the parameter be interpret differently by participant there be a high level of miss data on resource use at all timepoints a the section be often omit where participant be find the interview difficult a a result this limit the type of analysis we be able to conduct with a complete case analysis be undertake by exclude those who do not have complete data in relation to these measure at all timepoints we note that there may be bias in the result finally we be aware that the month follow up in the present study do not allow long term impact to be fully capture in our study we have terminate the month follow up owe to the cost associate with the covid pandemic and the wider difficulty of recruit from a trauma population equality diversity and inclusion in the cochrane review process evaluation and main cohort study our representation of important population characteristic be restrict to some extent to those include within exist study employ in sexual assault service and who have access sarcs in say that the study of the cochrane review include global majority and or minoritised survivor of our cohort sample comprised individual from racially minoritised group and we have considerable diversity across disability mental health and socioeconomic status we take several step to expand the reach of our work for example in the representation in our video and other recruitment material because it be know that minoritised group may be at great risk of sexual violence and abuse and be under represent in sarcs we conduct our narrative study with intentional recruitment through maximum variation sample to reach minoritised people include people who have not access sarc we work consistently with our leg to expand diversity of that group and the

centre i leave that area because of what happen with my husband it be like verbal abuse emotional abuse and sexual abuse a well i have to leave i just couldn t cope anymore my mental health be go through the roof i think the old you be the more difficult it be because i feel that maybe some people be like oh nobody s go listen to me i m not worth nothing i m not worth the bother do you know what i mean i feel that a you get old you do find thing a lot hard to even register what s happen sometimes you don t know where to look you don t know who s go be your first point of call to call someone because you re that shock that it s actually happen in the first place box jane s narrative contains detail that some people may find upsetting i didn t report for five day after the assault and then i end up call and they say you need to speak to a sarc they give me the number of the sarc and i ring them and they be really really good we have a conversation and they call me back there be a forensic examiner on the phone and a crisis worker they go through what have happen i say i ve get mental health they say we re not judge on your mental health it s get nothing to do with that they arrange for me to go in quite quickly so i have a forensic examination which be obviously really hard work but they be very supportive a few day later i do get the police involve and i feel now that be a mistake two very young officer come to my flat in the evening which i think be inappropriate i wasn t offer female officer i think as soon a i tell them i ve get mental health issue it their attitude change towards me they say well if this do go to court yeah your record your mental health record will be show to the court those two police officer they never ever look at the photograph from the sarc they never look at any of those thing i felt they have an agenda after they saw me they do find the guy that assault me but they basically just give him a tell off that be what i felt they just disregard what i have to say we isva and survivor do a decision review with the police because we felt the original decision wasn t appropriate i get video record later down the line which really upset me because i couldn t remember some of the stuff from the assault i felt that one of the female officer be very judgmental she ask me question about my previous sexual experience which i refuse to answer because it s none of her business we have some information back from the sergeant who be look into the investigation he make out that if it have be slightly bad maybe but how can you rate an injury i have you know internal bruising a bad or bad that just really make me angry we could have meet with him afterwards and i be like not a chance i ve have enough of the police if you see what i mean i be just like no it s not go to help me do you know what i mean so i be like no i have a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder and that at time that be use a a bit like a weapon or that be a barrier for me to access certain support i felt it be use in a sort of negative way the sarc refer me for counsel service but when i say that i have complex mental health the woman counsellor say well we only really deal with people with anxiety and depression she start to obsess about my mental health when i start session with her on the phone i say actually i m not here to talk about mental health it s to do with the sexual assault it be a if you couldn t actually access that service if you have a complex mental health diagnosis and in the end i stop it because i felt it be make it more detrimental i don t have any support from mental health service at all now so they just say if thing get really bad you ve get to go to a and e but a and e s not the best place i ve

police i want it to go to court if it can if they ve get enough evidence obviously this happen year ago when i be between and i ve bury it for such a long time i still feel really angry about it there s no way to describe the anger i feel that he take away part of my soul and heart he take my childhood away obviously speak to the police bring everything back up my parent didn t want to know when i speak to them about it i grow up in the age of where everything be hide so i keep this totally from everybody until i hear that he be put in prison that give me the courage to come forward that s how this process start ii support i feel in a very good place at this moment in time i feel that the support i ve have from different organisation have be really helpful listening and try to explain to me that i wasn t at fault my mechanism before to shut everything out i ve still get that sort of mechanism but i can bring thing up now without really be upset about it i feel the police have be really helpful the lady that s be deal with the case have be really helpful in the sense of explain everything have go to the police when i do it have release so much pressure from me in the sense of let people in the only thing i feel probably that everybody else in my situation feel it take long than you anticipate the process of the police talk to suspect it s not the police s fault it s just the way the system work i be probably a bit na\u00efve in the sense of think once i d make a statement everything else would have fall in place a lot quicker say that i feel that the support i ve have from isva service from sarc have give me a good outlook on life with the help that i ve be have through the different organisation it s help me tremendously and know that they re there iii reaction from family friend and society today year ago when i be talk about it it wasn t heard i wasn t heard look back over the last couple of year of go through the process it seem to be that it s only be bring to light in the sense of more people be be listen to so i feel in that representation we be be hear a lot more and take seriously which i have never felt before it have be a lot more open it s more accessible you re not afraid to talk about it i feel that i ve get to a good place now where i feel that if i need to talk to somebody say friend for instance or work colleague even i m not ashamed i m not ashamed to talk about it i ve be very fortunate with my work they ve be really good and helpful i feel that without them it would have be a lot more difficult with everybody be on board it have be a lot well hr have be really good so s my son and my best mate he s be an absolute rock as well w hat get me really upset at time be if i m watch television and abuse come on the television without without any warning for instance when they be talk about prince andrew and then when they say thing there be television programme that it s actually get the subject in that perhaps i didn t realise that it have then i start watch it then it come on or they show perhaps something s happen again in the wider world then i feel really feel really bad iv recovery i feel that the police be do all that they can so i feel that he s not actually control now because they ve get to do everything the right way so i feel know that the system be be use correctly that i know that if and when thing do process forward i know that everything have be deal with properly so i feel a lot happy i feel anxious i don t feel depress with it i feel uptight because obviously it s take a lot long than i anticipate but by come forward as well it s help not only myself but if i could help somebody else in the process then i feel it s all be worthwhile as well because there be a lot of u out there that s not either come forward or hasn t be hear i just get a bit upset not to the point where i m cry anymore not at the moment perhaps when the case go forward might feel differently although i want the case to go forward nobody know how you re go to react so yes and obviously when he use to trap he trap me in the shower when we be on holiday a well i feel that all those thing they re still in the back of my mind but it s come into the open people know about it and gradually people have a good understanding of my personality my best mate say to me the other day that he understand

in a really good place in the sense that i know everybody be play a part everybody s work behind the scene so it s up to me in the sense of have the help and understanding how i feel and how to deal

note the lack of systematic research into client perspective on remote method of deliver psychotherapy specifically they argue that it be important to explore this in the context of the pandemic where online and telephone support be largely impose by circumstance rather than by client choice brown et al s qualitative synthesis of the experience of psychosocial intervention for sexual violence find

quantitative data and involved assessment of form of help seek during the pandemic for example sorenson et al s assessment of call no research have document the voice of victim and survivor of sexual

and organ isations in england extend the value of this work this original research explore the view of those who work in sexual assault referral centre sarcs i e medico legal setting those who work at a strategic commission level of the sexual violence service non governmental agen cies i e the voluntary sector and the police regard the change bring about by the pan demic these organisation represent the key support organisation and those who shape those service for victim and survivor in their help seek and subsequent recovery journey this research employ an ecological model to organise the examination of the impact of covid on victim and survivor heal and recovery journey and service delivery in sexual violence and abuse service this framework have previously be apply to service utilisation and health outcome a it support understand the complex and interconnect factor that can have a cumulative effect on health golden and earp in apply this theory to the experience of victim survivor and professional the finding from this study will articulate factor that influ ence survivor recovery across microsystems mesosystems exosystems macrosystems and chron osystems chynoweth et al stockman et al microsystems refer to the survivor s immediate environment and interaction such a interaction with support service and their immediate personal support network mesosystems relate to connection between component of the microsystem such a communication between agency that work with victim and survivor and also service delivery for example in the context of this current research change in mode of service delivery during the pandemic may reduce effective rapport between staff and client sleath et al therefore impact on client ability to cope and recover campbell et al with research at this level sparse zinzow et al the exosystem level be quite remove from the daily experi ences of service user but a dworkin and weaver point out this do not mean policy procedure and practice at that level can not influence people s experience for example policy and blanket message about lock down community and nation may have lead victim and survivor to perceive that service be simply unavailable the impact of the pandemic be cap tured at the macrosystem level in the form of an environmental stressor with researcher now define the pandemic a a form of sociocultural level trauma e g bridgland et al the final level to consider be chronosystem factor which encapsulate change that occur over time in all the use of this model be extremely effective in capture the complex interplay between indi viduals system process and culture as well a change over time an approach that have be previously identify a an important focus of future research e g campbell et al zinzow et

trauma recovery be apply to contex tualise the finding in relation to how they may affect survivor recovery see campbell et al this theory identify three stage of trauma recovery safety remembrance and mourning and reconnection it use in frame the finding will seek to understand how this pathway while rarely linear be affect particularly when the trauma could have be additionally layer with the experience of the pandemic at the first stage of recovery safety be re establish across physi cal safety emotional safety and develop cop mechanism remembrance and mourn involve the narrative of the trauma recalling and mourn the trauma experience and confronting and processing trauma in supportive environment finally reconnection involves create a future for the survivor reclaim their empowerment and reconnecting with themselves relationship and community herman this research provide a unique triangulation of perspective from victim survivor and pro fessionals across a range of agency that support them during the pandemic the research question be how do the pandemic impact on survivor of sexual violence and abuse and their help seek and recovery journey what be the impact of

diagrams represent the dominant area that be explore in detail below impact of covid on victim and survivor recovery journey and help seek victim and survivor emphasise several primary problem in relation to how covid hinder or have a negative impact on their well be and help seek increased feeling of depression anxi ety or worry feeling of isolation or cop alone reduce informal support e g from family friend or co worker and reduced access to helpful activity or cop strategy victim and survivor speak about how covid intensify or exacerbate their struggle with feeling of depression anxiety and worry e g it make my anxiety and depression a lot bad i have felt really low not sleep and suicidal s year these feeling coincide with other worry for some survivor the abuse happen and then a few month later covid happen i felt anxious and wor ried about health and make end meet i would say i be depress a lot s month they also speak about be alone e g i be stick here a lot on my own s year and a lack of contact and interaction with others i report to the isva service and the police and then we go into lock down so i go into a meltdown face all of that by myself i live alone and be so isolated i felt i be crumble s baseline in term of help seek victim and survivor often refer to hav ing reduce informal support there be frequent reference to not be able to see friend and fam ily who be consider key source of support which affect emotional well be or mental health normally when i m in a low mood i would surround myself with people who would bring me up again and just spend time with them but i couldn t do that during the first lockdown so i find it difficult to not have that regular contact s baseline sleath et al figure theme relate to the impact of covid on survivor well be figure theme relate to the impact of covid on service delivery international review of victimology victim and survivor sense of isolation in the aftermath of violence and abuse coincide with increased feeling of depression anxiety and worry victim and survivor also experience reduced access to helpful activity or cop strate gy exercise be one of these with the closure of gym during lockdown period be keenly felt e g thing that i have in place like go to the gym have be take away s month along with other physical activity one of the thing i love be dance it s part of my therapy it s be difficult not be able to access dance class it s part of me it really light me up s baseline victim and survivor speak about their recovery journey slow down become more dif ficult e g it have be a lot hard try to work through my issue in lockdown s baseline or be disrupt or go backwards e g i feel like i ve go backwards after i ve work so hard for thing to get thing to normal s month while this isolation and loss of interaction be experience negatively by most just over a fifth of survivor perceive benefit to the national lockdown focus on feeling protect by stay at home or have few interaction with people and this period be consider a time for heal ing or reflection or have increase opportunity to spend time with or have contact with family and friends these participant find that the covid restriction mean that they could avoid the challenge or anxiety associate with be away from home it have also help that i be not expect to go out of the house i be nervous about leave the house i don t want to leave in that respect it be more sensible to stay at home so i have an excuse s baseline some victim and survivor felt that covid enable them to have time for heal or reflection due to have more time available and few everyday pressure yes it definitely have and i would say very very surprisingly i think it have actually give me a lot of opportunity and the ability to do the healing process properly s baseline furthermore this group of survivor perceive that they benefit from the pandemic in have increase opportunity to spend time with or have contact with family and friends this particu larly focus on the increased availability of people and accessibility through digital method i can talk to friend online it s be very easy for me to contact people because they ve always be at home s year these finding represent the critical interaction between different level of the ecological model whereby the implementation of a national lockdown at the exosystem level primarily have a negative impact at the microsystem level for survivor in reduce their interaction with their social network and increase isolation however these data also capture the recognisably small proportion of participant for whom these change at the exosystem system represent positive influence on their microsystem with great time to access their social network and time for heal ing and reflection impact of covid on service delivery integrate professional and victim and survivor voice impact on service delivery coalesce around the following change in service delivery impact of covid control measure availability and access to support service deliver care and support online or by telephone and negative impact on staff due to change in service delivery sleath et al change in service delivery participant speak about how service delivery change with the advent of covid represent the mesosystem level of the ecological model with emphasis on the shift to approach that reduce face to face contact professional who work in sarcs focus their discussion on the use of self swabbing and triaging of client before attend the site a policy and procedure exosystem that be directly introduce to address the advent of the pandemic a part of this discussion professional share how they determine the appropriateness of remote care to meet the need of different client highlight how service delivery mesosystem be influence by exosystem element if the client have have any need or disability or felt that it wouldn t be in the client s best interest to offer that remote over the phone assessment then i d be advise of that on that initial call from private forensic service book service in which case i d obviously close down whatever i m do this side go across and get change and ready into sort of full ppe personal protective equipment to meet that client crisis worker impact of covid control measure both professional and victim survivor highlight the spe cific impact that covid safety policy and procedure have on service delivery professional discuss the wearing of personal protective equipment whereas victim and survivor talk about restriction for example they be not permit to take a supporter with them to appoint ments overarch this be the view that covid measure obstruct interaction between victim and survivor and professional professional from sarcs particularly highlight the triaging of client discuss earlier a have an impact on the rapport and support that they could provide to client and you just think wow because if you re go in to have such an intimate examination for a disclosure of a sexual assault and you ve speak to people over the phone about your most private kind of personal information then you come in and we re all goggle up mask up glove and apron and stuff and then you re swab in and out within minute to half an hour and yeah you just feel so wrong crisis worker these impact be specifically highlight in relation to child we have to wear ppe for every examination which i think for child can be quite scary and obviously you can t build that same relationship with them crisis worker participant raise concern that this impact on the quality of care be provide i think that s the thing it s like not be able to give the level of service that i would normally be happy to give crisis worker this view be echo by victim and survivor i feel nervous and alone but there will be a unknown lady in the live link room with me who will sit behind me but she doesn t know what s happen and you can t grab her hand for support s month one survivor report a particularly negative experience asso ciated with expectation about face covering and how this impact on her care when attend for a routine cervical smear test at her family doctor practice i can t wear a face mask due to anxiety i book in for a smear at gp general practitioner i explain to the receptionist she be lovely and i be offer to try a screen face shield i try but i couldn t do it the nurse come out screaming at me shout at me put your mask on immediately trigger my post traumatic stress disorder i be deeply upset i say to her you should know good you re a health professional the receptionist bring me a cup of tea with sugar i be so upset i couldn t do the smear and i still haven t have it s baseline international review of victimology availability and access to support service access to service during the pandemic be an important theme for participant with nearly of the sample comment on this of these half report no change in service or access however the remainder identify significant difficulty or delay in access service and a lack of sup port service or reduction in support service both victim and survivor and professional identi fied that victim and survivor be experience longer wait time particularly for therapeutic or counsel service i have be on a wait list for counsel and when i join the wait list it be like an month wait and when that period come i would have be sure to start that in december but because of covid it have all be put back there have be delay in be able to have that and i don t know when that will be it will be come up two year in may june time that i will have be on the wait list s year wait time to access standard appointment be also longer specifically in access family doctor service general practice it have be harder to get appointment for the doctor and stuff it take me a good few month to get an actual appointment with my gp about antidepressant s month a service be only contactable online or via the telephone victim and survi vors be unable to make contact i ve try and try call them and i never get an answer or reply from them s year delay be also experience in criminal justice process it have slow down the police investigation a lot s baseline and access to justice with court case cancel or delay on several occasion while this theme demonstrate the mixed experience of participant in relation to availability and access to service represent exosystem factor this theme should be carefully consider in the context of the next theme whereby the mode or nature of interaction between survivor and service provider microsystem have change significantly deliver care and support online or by telephone half of the participant explore their perception of the shift to remote care and support of these nearly two third of the victim survivor and professional be negative about online telephone service delivery with strong preference for face to face service delivery particu larly for counsel but also in relation to other service like family doctor general practice and the police for these participant online telephone service delivery reduce engagement in help seek and support e g yes because of coronavirus i can t go in person so i m wait for when the clinic open because i be not really want to speak about this over the phone s baseline and victim and survivor report not want this mode of support the therapist refer me to a mindfulness course which i start but i have stop a it s online s month professional speak about client who they believe have disengage from service due to not be able to engage in online telephone service the appropriateness of this mode of care for young and old client also raise concern the issue of interaction between victim and survivor and professional be also a feature of this theme a see in the covid control measure where participant say remote care create new challenge in building rapport which could impact on the trust therapeutic relationship and present a bar rier between victim and survivor and professional victim and survivor talk about the need to have a proper chat s baseline that there be more of a disconnect over the sleath et al phone s baseline and that it s hard to build relationship online and it make peo ple s body language harder to read s month professional echo these concern and say they worry they be miss important communication cue from client you can t see how someone be you know some people we ve speak to over the phone have go quite quiet at different point and you don t know whether they re just actually distract by something and they re fine or they make themselves a drink or something or actually they re upset and they re struggle to answer the question or struggle to speak deputy sarc manager while a large proportion voice negative view of this mode of care and support of survivor identify benefit of remote care particularly in make service easy to engage with in contrast to the view above these participant felt that talk over the phone online be easy because they felt more relaxed s baseline that the distance of a telephone call be well for me s base line when talk about difficult topic and that it speak over the phone didn t feel like such a big deal s baseline link the mode of delivery with accessibility victim and survivor welcome not need to travel and that appointment could fit more easily into a day a view ech oed by professional who note the ease of accessibility and that this work for particular type of client e g old adolescent sarc staff emphasise how triaging client by phone reduce the time need on site at the sarc where shorter attendance time be view again to increase the accessibility of ser vice particularly for client with caregiving responsibility staff report feeling well pre par for client when they arrive because we ve do all that over the phone and get more info over the phone than we usually would it mean that we re able to set up and prepare prior to the victim arrive deputy sarc manager specifically in relation to child staff talk about more opportunity to allay concern of parent guardian before attend and to learn about thing that may make the visit easy for child to undertake we can think about you know if they say oh she love paw patrol then we load up the ipad with a paw patrol video clinical director negative impact on staff due to change in service delivery professional work in sexual abuse and violence service experience a considerable shift from be co locate with their team and colleague at their usual service premise to individual home work in reflect on this change professional report blurred work life boundary demonstrate important organisational challenge to the segmentation between work and home and the specific challenge give the nature of their work i think an additional impact from this whole situation be like now that we re do email referral from home it kind of brings it into my kind of safe space and when i get home from work i want to be home from work i don t want to be think about it and it s here it s in my house now like i m read about these awful thing happen to people in my home crisis worker participant refer to other negative impact of lone work and transition to home office focus on the loss of team support network demonstrate challenge at the mesosystem level i think i ve get more use to it now but i think in early lockdown i be really struggle because normally i d be in the office and if i be on a really hard call or you know it sound quite heavy there would international review of victimology usually be someone in the office that would be like oh be you okay do you want to go for a walk and a break triage worker while professional talk about approach that have be implement in recognition of this issue e g whatsapp group more frequent check in with manager there be still a sense that self care suffer in a context of home work when you re in person in the office at the minute you feel you need to talk to someone you get to just stop and talk about stuff isva this demonstrate the importance of mesosystem level factor for the resilience of professional which ultimately impact on quality and availability of care and support provide to survivors other impact explore the practical challenge of home work include the need to acquire suitable equipment and to access confidential sensitive client information at home securely discussion the pandemic produce a recalibration of health and care service delivery and insight and appli cation that will be vital for buffer service and service user include survivor of sexual violence majeed ariss et al against extraordinary event of the future this study contrib utes to this knowledge have gather in real time the voice of people who have be seek support for exposure to sv when the pandemic hit or be victimise during the pandemic period it novelty be in hear directly about the experience of sexual violence and abuse victim and survivor in access and engage in remote care and how the pandemic be perceive to have affect their recovery journey the study additionally present the perspective of professional from a range of health and support organisation to highlight the impact of the wide scale change to service delivery and uncover new potential opportunity and challenge for the future of service delivery in this area discussion paper e g gunby et al and research provide a snapshot of the impact of covid e g almeida anticipate some of these challenge however this research ground those factor in data provide by victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse augment by professional in the sexual violence sector although base in an english context these impact and their implication be relevant internationally for example the shift to remote care and support be undertake globally e g polk contribution to theory model in the context of the current study the rupturing of normal daily life have serious implication for the coping mechanism and help seek use by victim and survivor in do so this demon strates how the additional impact of the pandemic disrupt recovery journey victim and survivor report worsen symptom of depression anxiety or worry as well a increase feeling of isolation and depleted resource e g reduce access to cop strategy such a exercise and opportunity for recovery in establish safety herman identify how survivor can oscillate between surround themselves with people at all time and isolate themselves entirely in relation to the former the pandemic significantly disrupt the opportu nities that survivor have for contact with friend and family frequently well understood to pro mote positive well be for sexual violence and abuse victim and survivor e g littleton for the latter a small number of survivor identify the benefit of the pandemic in rela tion to safety see the pandemic restriction a a way to feel protected reduce their sleath et al interaction with other people and consider this a time for heal alongside the impact of the pandemic on well be the pandemic also disrupt usual pathway to support e g shift to remote care potentially undermining or protract the remembrance and mourn stage of recovery victim and survivor report reduced access to care delay to care and poor percep tions experience of remote care in contrast a with the finding in relation to safety a small number of survivor report benefit to the shift to remote care enhance their ability to engage and process their trauma through remote mean finally in relation to reconnection the impact of the pandemic be clearly visible across the data in hinder a survivor from engage more actively in the world in summary herman s trauma theory contextualises these finding in relation to how the pandemic may have slow or protract recovery furthermore trauma researcher have determine that the pandemic itself be experience a a form of trauma or traumatic stress bridgland et al add further complexity to the recovery journey for survivor of sexual violence during this time previous research have identify a need for a more detailed understanding of the different factor of the ecological model and importantly how these different factor interact campbell et al zinzow et al this research deliver this by capture interaction across multiple layer of the model and so extend our understanding of the ecological model in relation to help seek and recovery journey it demonstrate how the pandemic context exacerbate or produce barrier and facilitator to recovery for survivor by highlight interaction between policy and procedure such a covid safety measure a exosystem factor and how these impact microsystem factor in the quality of interaction between victim and survivor and service pro viders of significance for this research be the importance of mesosystem factor a an individ ual factor e g interaction between professional but also in it interaction with other layer of the ecological model specifically exosystem e g accessibility of service and microsystem fac tor e g interaction between victim and survivor and professional therefore the data offer multiple instance of interplay and influence between the level of these factor in do so it present a more detailed and nuanced comprehension of how these level may exacerbate or worsen health outcome for victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse the ecological model be also relevant to finding relate to professional concern be raise in the early literature publish in the pandemic regard service delivery at the mesosys tem level e g gunby et al these data document those finding but also highlight the critical need to resolve the associated challenge face professional at this mesosystem level link theory to practice specifically in relation to blur work home life boundary and reduced access to team support which be magnify among those work in the sexual violence and abuse service crivatu et al while many organisation return to face to face ser vice a pandemic restriction reduce or be remove the majority continue to deliver their service use a blended approach the survivor trust urgent consideration therefore need to focus on how these staff will be support to reduce the likelihood of them experience the negative impact of work in this sector for example compassion fatigue burnout factor such a organisational culture and supervisor and co worker support represent potentially inter act factor across macrosystems and mesosystems so it be important to understand the role of such factor in the specific context of those who work in the sexual violence sector for example supervisor should consider their role in support staff in this new way of work to manage their work life domains ultimately the resilience of this sector impact on the quality of the sup port provide to survivor of sexual violence and abuse give the finding of this study suggest international review of victimology that there may be increase service use by victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse in the long term a a result of the pandemic this issue be of critical importance to ensure there be a robust and resilient sector contribution to practice in the context of the current study the rupturing of normal daily life have serious implication for victim and survivor not be able to address the mental health sequela of abuse and the cumu lative effect of experience the pandemic be likely to have knock on effect for economic and social well be for education and in respect of care responsibility and look after child if victim and survivor experience longer period where they need help e g wait for their legal case to be hear in court service provider be likely to find that client remain with them longer and or may require more intensive support and therapy where disclosure have be delay and early intervention have therefore not be forthcoming e g bicanic et al ruggiero et al post pandemic service provider have continue to adapt but consideration of long term plan for their service be need specifically focus on how the pandemic have shape the need of client and the timing of disclosure e g survivor report historic abuse victim of sexual offence where there be complex need link to social and housing circumstance disability and substance use such change in the length of support and nature of present or comorbid issue be likely to add far strain to a sector that be already over stretch and under fund prior to the pandemic e g rape crisis change to mode of service delivery e g the shift from in person to remote care raise mul tiple concern in our participant suggest an inefficient mechanism for support recovery but these negative perception need to be set in context first the provision of remote care be unlikely to have cause more harm than not provide the care at all second and a note by smith et al these change in delivery be impose on client rather than select by choice which may have affect how client perceive them brown et al argue that if service be to be deliver through remote technology platform or simply by telephone it be critical to prepare victim and survivor and their carers appropriately and manage people s expectation suggest a pathway to where client may find this mode of delivery more acceptable furthermore in these data positive response about remote care emphasise ease of engagement and factor that could increase the accessibility and quality of service provide to sexual violence and abuse victim and survivor while also reduce rate of cancelled appointment of particular relevance when resource be stretch there be many consideration in select remote or in person care include the stage the person be at vi \u00e0 vi disclosure and the complexity of their need and their circumstance can a client achieve safety and confidentiality at home and importantly the nature of the care and support be deliver on the one hand provide advocacy and low intensity emotional support remotely may work quite effectively for provider and client alike for therapy and counsel some therapy for example trauma focus cbt in acierno et al do lend themselves to remote delivery however others e g emdr may require in person interaction the resulting message from this current study be that victim and survivor be not a homogeneous group and differ in their need and support requirement the sector itself frequently recognise this but more broadly commission framework need to acknowledge that a one size fit all approach specifically in relation to the mode of delivery that be that either in person or remote care should be provide be unlikely to represent best practice in support client sleath et al therefore commissioner may need to facilitate process that enable organisation to consider how to extend client option in respect of how support be provide it need not be a dichotomous set of possibility within organisation establish the need and preference of client could encompass aspect set out in box box consideration in select an approach to service delivery what approach or method do client feel most able and comfortable to use how can they best convey their own need and view e g do the client recognise a difficulty with communicate over the telephone explore with the client any barrier or enablers to talk about challenge or sensitive issue what approach or method address these barrier and enablers e g trust rapport what be the most appropriate therapeutic approach for the presenting issue and how do this fit with the communication preference of the client encourage client to identify practical consideration e g access to adequate internet service an occupation or care give responsibility that mean it be challenge to schedule face to face appointment who else be live at home and can the client find a quiet confidential safe space equally the provider need to consider these factor for themselves to ensure they be in a position to offer best practice response e g a stable internet connection access to support where they be support high risk client or difficult issue have arise this decision make process be most important at the beginning of service use however organisation will know that client need can change over the course of service engagement this mean that service should reflect on whether and how they can will provide support flexi bly where client may shift mode of delivery accord to their change need on their recovery journey these be not small consideration particularly in the context of resource constraint however the professional within this study recognise the cost effectiveness of ubiquitous tech nology base support solution limitation while the research be possible due to an exist research infrastructure ongoing longitudi nal study with survivor of sexual violence post sarc the exploration of the impact of covid on victim and survivor journey be a small component of the full interview a great focus on the impact of covid may have uncover additional experience we inter view victim and survivor post contact with a sarc and there be variation in their recovery journey and experience for example not all be involve in criminal justice process and there be great variation in the stage of this process in those that be so most have not experience court trial and so would not have be able to comment on these aspect the participant in the mesarch study represent a specific help seek sample and a such do not represent victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse across the english population for example sarc user more often seek help for stranger and acquaintance sexual assault lovell et al which may carry less stigma and therefore promote capaci tie to seek help finally a the response be document verbatim by interviewer rather than be audio record there be the small potential for loss of meaning or misunderstanding of content in the contemporaneous noting of these response international review of victimology conclusion this study have identify important implication of the pandemic for victim and survivor profes sionals and service use in the future span both theory and practice covid amplify the challenge of living a a victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse impinging and interact ing across multiple level of the ecological model and subsequently diminish pathway to help seek across health service voluntary sector support and criminal justice experience sexual violence and abuse significantly disrupt people s life who and the challenge to recov ery journey of victim and survivor identify in our research of which seek access to justice and therapy be key part mean that those impact continue to ripple across the life of victim and survivor their family child and other supporter future research explore the long term impact of the pandemic on victim and survivor recovery journey be need to provide a comprehensive understanding of their experience this research also need to include victim and survivor who do not access sarc service a their experience may be different from the spe cific help seek sample in our study the pandemic amplify the emotional work associate with provide service to victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse with less recourse to source of support for staff against a backdrop of blurred work life boundary and a changed mix of client access ser vice organisation need to consider carefully how they can support staff to mitigate any poten tial negative impact to the new way in which they work reduce the likelihood of burnout and compassion fatigue and avoid further reduction in staffing and resource in the sector the research have highlight some positive development a a result of adapt to the pandemic in term of identify new method and strategy that may be integrate into best practice response to sexual violence and abuse for example triaging client before attend a sarc may increase the accessibility of the service for client with particular need this evidence can inform service response to future global crisis and remain important even now to increase the accessibility and ease of availability of service for some client this remain an important consideration for victim and survivor of sexual violence and abuse who frequently experience barrier to care and support in summary empowerment through offering option be a hallmark of a good practice response in this context the experience of victim and survivor and organisation adapt to pandemic condition have uncover advantage of cost effective ubiquitous technology solu tions for provide information advocacy and short and long term support there be significant scope for these opportunity to be capture and integrate into service delivery more long term however these come with the important caveat that any novel service improvement should be underpin by client choice robust infrastructure e g staff be support confidentiality be guarantee on both side and monitoring and flexibility to ensure that the service meet the change need of the client acknowledgements the author would like to acknowledge the support of rosie stone and

context our participant extensively discuss s reveal a signi cant implementation gap for this measure which we argue be likely to substantially undermine it effective operation fi in what follow we divide our discussion into three main part in the rst part we provide a brief description of the background to and design of s in england and wale include an account of fi it implementation journey to date and the key ndings from associate ministry of justice process eva luations we then turn to our jicsav project and describe the collection and analysis method use in fi relation to the data that underpin the ndings and discussion we present here in the third and most sub fi stantive part we set out our key ndings relevant to s in a context in which the implementation of s have inevitably continue to evolve in the period since our data collection we also highlight here the fi fl extent to which more recent commentary support the ongoing relevance of our ndings and re ect on munro et al the overall implication for the future operation of this special measure a matter on which there remain fi considerable concern and debate uk parliament in the nal section we conclude that s have the potential to bring improved experience for complainant and witness however there remain sub stantial challenge to it implementation that reduce it prospect for success and which need to be fi address a a priority while some of these may be speci c to the english and welsh context and or to s procedure many be apt to also be encounter in other jurisdiction include for example scotland northern ireland new zealand and some australian state where reform to expand mode of testimony delivery to include more routine use of pre record cross examination par ticularly by witness in sexual offence

commission section background and implementation s of the yjcea allow vulnerable and or intimidate witness and complainant in england and wale to pre record their cross examination before the trial so that the s recording can be pre sented during trial without the witness need to attend this special measure can only be use where an achieving best evidence abe investigative interview have already be video record by the police under youth justice and criminal evidence act s which be typically then rely upon to provide the complainant s evidence in chief fi fi any complainant who be eligible for and may bene t from utilise s should be identi ed by the fi police investigating of cer as early a possible in the investigation process a outline in the criminal fi practice direction the crown prosecution service cps should also be noti ed by fi the of cer at an early stage that the case be one that could potentially involve use of s once a positive charging decision have be reach the cps prosecutor should notify the magistrate court at the first hearing about any s application which be then make at the plea and trial preparation hear ptph in the crown court if the s application be accept the timetable for the case should also be agree at the ptph although it availability be not restrict to witness in sexual offence case recent evidence submit to the justice committee inquiry on the use of s have indicate that since the commence ment of pilot provision to vulnerable witness in these have constitute the overwhelming volume of case where the measure have be use per cent thomas para case management in a s case require early disclosure and a ground rule hear grh in relation to the former process for secure and screen disclosure should begin immediately even prior to any charge decision baverstock this be key to ensure timely case progression fi more broadly but in s case it can be particularly important since many of the bene t to complainant and witness of early evidence capture will be negate if they have to be recall for further cross examination because of new information or evidence in the case the right of the defendant to a fair trial in s case be also safeguard in this context in relation to the grh the individual need of the complainant should be discuss as well a the particular of the cross examination process in the case of vulnerable complainant the length of the s hearing and the question to be put will also be determine criminal practice direction the s hearing mark the beginning of the trial criminal practice direction at the

direction the cross examination recording be then store securely until it be play to the jury at trial the international journal of evidence proof section case thus have distinctive practical feature amongst them be the expedited timeframe require in relation to case investigation and preparation charging and disclosure this mean that much of the work in s case be front loaded particularly for the police and cps a further feature be the requirement for continuity of prosecution counsel throughout the ptph grh s hearing and the remainder of the substantive trial whilst continuity of defence representation be also encourage it be not currently mandatory unless order by the judge criminal practice direction similarly whilst it be possible that the same judge may sit throughout the case this be not required unless order by the resident judge or nominate lead s judge criminal practice direction the recording of cross examination prior to trial allows it to take place earlier in the process which may aid witness and complainant recall and thereby improve the quality of substantive evidence roswell et al section also aim to improve the experience of the criminal justice process

pilot to help understand whether the pilot process work a intend and to help guide policy decision on whether and how best to roll out s more widely after the pilot baverstock this evaluation pub lished in capture the perspective of practitioner alongside witness and their parent carers who utilise the s measure it also analyse monitoring data collect during the pilot in order to generate indicative estimate of the potential outcome and timeliness of s case and the potential volume of case in the event of a wider roll out baverstock it conclude base on analysis of case where s be use by witness in the pilot court that the measure could save court time by reduce trial length baverstock and may encourage great use of guilty plea by defendant a a consequence of evidence be gather and

intimidated witness and complainant be nonetheless undertaken be complete across england and wale in september ward et al while fi this expedite process render the ndings of the second evaluation somewhat redundant in determine the appropriateness of a national roll out for this cohort it nevertheless provide useful insight into the challenge and opportunity associate with the operation of the provision and it effect on trial pro cesses these include an improved experience for witness give evidence via s compare to fi cross examination live at trial ward et al but mixed perception around the bene t of s in relation to witness attrition and engagement and concern about negative impact on court listing pressure ward et al in addition although the process evaluation do not explore the impact of the use of s on plea or conviction outcome directly through data from the pilot sit it report that participant felt that there would likely be minimal impact thereon ward et al together these two process evaluation commission by the ministry of justice do provide import ant insight not least since until very recently they afford the only published analysis of s which incorporate qualitative data gather from criminal justice professional and witness by the author own admission however both be limit in their scope the pilot process evaluation uti lised a small sample of practitioner n and witness interview n and an analysis of monitor ing data from the three pilot court leeds liverpool and kingston upon thames with a potentially fi signi cant acknowledgement from the outset that the court choose for the pilot be select because judge in those court be supportive of the principle of s baverstock a fi such the generalisability of the evaluation s ndings outside of the pilot area be unclear similar issue also befall the evaluation which summarise the view and experience of a small cross section of practitioner and witness in a select few pilot area work at different stage of the roll out ward et al the focus within both evaluation solely on the pilot region mean that their wide applicability may be limit particularly give the additional resourcing afford to ori fi ginal pilot site for their role in the development and implementation of s and the signi cant variabil ity of infrastructure listing pressure and personnel resource across the country it be also notable that no member of the judiciary be interview in the evaluation despite their importance to the effect fi ive operation of s with the judicial of ce instead only provide a write response ward et al a justice committee inquiry initiate in have now generate far important insight via sub mission from various practitioner and academic stakeholder include the jicsav team jicsav fi these submission have document ndings that supplement exist process evaluation for example through additional research interview with practitioner involve in s case outside of pilot region fairclough and or through observation of the current day to day reality of the trial process for vulnerable and intimidated witness whether or not they make use of s measure jackson et al kyneswood some submission have highlight with particular urgency and concern the practical effect of the extended roll out of s on court listing and barrister work load cba coeus while one have report a potentially negative effect on the prospect for conviction a a result of use s at least under current condition of implementation thomas together with other related research that have recently explore broad shift within the landscape the international journal of evidence proof of adversarial cross examination jackson et al and evaluate the adequacy of current prosecutor ial strategy in rape and serious sexual offence rasso case king et al this have present a complicated picture it be one in which it be clear that a we discuss below s have the potential to bring improved experience and positive outcome for complainant and witness but there have be and continue to be substantial challenge to implementation that reduce prospect for success and which must be address a a priority method this article provide insight into the implementation and impact of s against a fast evolving policy fi and practice context we draw speci cally on novel qualitative data in the form of in depth semi structure interview which be conduct with participant across seven stakeholder group include criminal justice practitioner and complainant and their family in sexual offence case this repre sents a large and more diverse cross section of interviewee than in the s process evaluation or pre exist academic research our participant come from across england and wale and unlike the ministry of justice s evaluation our study include direct discussion with judge authorise to hear rasso case though our data clearly do not address all of the question that require to be consider in a rounded evaluation of s in particular for example we do not have access to quantitative data regard scale of usage timeframes for case progression and plea or conviction outcome it do provide important and original insight regard user experience of the special measure in practice and the way in which oversight and shortfall in implementation have at time present substantial fi fi barrier moreover while our eldwork end in mid a we will demonstrate our ndings continue fi fi to resonate with more recent account afford con dence when extrapolate ndings from this dataset to contemporary debate a note above the data underpinning this article be collect a part of the jicsav project jicsav which aim to identify impact of the covid pandemic on criminal justice policy and practice in sexual offence case as well a on practitioner complainant and their family and to pinpoint innovation that could improve the experience of complainant in sexual offence case beyond the pandemic whilst s be not introduce in response to the pandemic nor be it an initial focus of jicsav in early interview with criminal justice practitioner it be discuss by all participant because a phased national roll out have begin in during the pandemic period due to the emphasis fi place on s by these participant the interview schedule be amend to speci cally include ques tions about it a substantial amount of qualitative data be thus

our data collection and which we engage with below a such they re ect issue around implemen tation and impact that remain of ongoing concern albeit often within the broad context of a recog fi nition of the potential bene t associate with s for some complainant and witness in sexual offence case section implementation goal and gap promote recall and recovery and reduce re traumatisation across our interview participant there be a fairly settle view that the introduction of the s fi special measure at least for use by those identi ed under s of the yjcea a vulnerable wit fi ness and in particular young child be a welcome innovation two principal bene t associate with the use of s by this cohort be highlight first that early capture of evidence might improve the international journal of evidence proof prospect for accurate recall and second that it avoid the prospect of testimony give and court attendance loom over witness for an extended period of time in a context in which the dam age effect of trial delay and disruption be substantial and well documented rape crisis england and wale fi fl in relation to the rst point a detective constable p re ected for example that it can mas sively help in case where you re deal with child and recount a case involve a six year old complainant whose memory have already deteriorate in the time delay between his original abe interview and s examination p hypothesise that if this witness have be require to await a trial date before complete their cross examination it could potentially mean that he wasn t able to give any evidence and could mean that we end up losing case at court indeed several par fi ticipants be clear that s be of most bene t to child complainant for whom recollection be think to be more at risk of impairment whilst wait for trial ward et al when com par to adult witness something that have also be document within exist literature gudjonsson and henry fi though such bene t in relation to recall and recovery could also be relevant to the use of s by intimidated adult witness it be clear that several of our participant be less convince by their value in this context for example a rasso ticket judge j state that s should be limit to those witness for whom memory or trauma really be a live issue so child or witness fi fi with pronounced learn dif culties or very dif cult mental health issue within this context another rasso ticket judge j likewise question the value of s for recall and recovery in case where the adult witness be give testimony in respect of an allegation of non recent abuse they explain it be excellent to be able to capture someone s evidence well in advance particularly if they re very young it s absolutely crucial because obviously child s memory be different to adult and short but where you ve get an adult complainant make a complaint about something that happen year ago perhaps s be really quite pointless and may not be to the advantage of the complainant or the prosecution fl a we discuss in more detail later in the article such contribution may re ect a wider scepticism amongst some professional regard the extent to which otherwise competent adult witness need or indeed should be routinely offer such special measure in relation to testimony give this appear to be connect at time to a concern that juror could be less sympathetic to and engage with account provide by adult via a pre record even where they might be able to appreciate it value or appropriateness in relation to child complainant fi in relation to the second bene t highlight by participant which be link to expedited time scale for evidence completion a detective sergeant p emphasise that use of s for child wit ness will make a big difference in that it will speed up that process which they envisage would fi be of considerable bene t to that child s wellbeing meanwhile speak more generally a chief fi crown prosecutor c maintain that s be a massive bene t to complainant for whom if they can do their bit it s on the record it take away that burden of have in the back of your mind all the time i m go to have to give evidence about this i m go to have to be cross examine likewise a district crown prosecutor c emphasise that when s be use the victim s contribution be do and dust and they can kind of move on a little bit while a senior crown prosecutor c describe victim a be able to step back from the process and get on with their life after the s hearing be complete such sentiment have since be formally echo fi by the cps in their recent submission to the justice committee inquiry where ndings from research into wide operational shift in rasso case a a result of operation soteria pilot in a timeline that broadly coincide with the roll out of s to intimidate witness be also draw upon king et al there the cps underscore lawyer frequently positive appraisal of s a munro et al revolutionary make life easy for the complainant and give them some control back in respect of the criminal justice process crown prosecution service a para for many interviewee in our research this meant amongst other thing that complainant be fi able to access counsel support with great con dence that it would not undermine the justice process it be also recognise that there could be a reduced likelihood of complainant withdrawal if their evidence could be secure at an early stage with the prospect of further traumatisation in the court room be remove indeed the head of a cps rasso unit c explain we know that delay cause attrition the long a case go on the more likely the victim will say i m out of here so s allow them to give their evidence in chief and cross examination earlier in the process and that s fi a clear bene t fi fi the potential for some signi cant bene t to accrue a a result of use s in term of recall and recovery particularly in relation to child witness be therefore clear nevertheless other participant in our study be keen to caution that early capture of evidence do not always or fully relieve com plainants anxiety regard an impending trial and it outcome see also citizens advice witness service rape and sexual abuse counsel centre darlington and durham support after rape and sexual violence leeds a one senior isva s explain even if they ve do a s they ve still get a wait for the outcome so they just can t get on with their life they can t focus on their recovery because they ve still get this thing hang over their head this be a sentiment echoed by a s lead judge j who acknowledge the practical reality asso ciated with an impending trial if you do a s it could be month a defendant could be on bail in the area where you live and you ve give your evidence and you re worry about them have see what you ve say likewise the criminal bar association s cba submission to the justice committee con cluded that to take the view that s solves problem of delay in a backlogged criminal justice system by enable victim to get their part in the trial process over with sooner be false reasoning and ignores fi the reality that victim and defendant still have the case a a whole hanging over them until the nal verdict cba para a note in the extract from the cba above these issue be particularly pertinent in the context of the substantial backlog of case rasso and otherwise wait to be hear in crown court a of december rasso case be wait to go to the crown court a new record high fi rape crisis england and wales this backlog have increase signi cantly since the covid pan demic when jury trial be initially suspend and then reinstate with strict social distancing restric tions there have also be intervene period of barrister strike action and an overall attrition of practitioner from the criminal bar particularly pronounce in respect of practitioner undertake rasso work cba para compound that impact indeed the current rasso backlog represent an per cent increase from and the beginning of the covid pandemic rape fi crisis england and wales the bene t for complainant of deliver their evidence earlier in fi the process can be at least partially undermine where the trial be delay or take place a signi cant time after the s hearing and one barrister have recently suggest in evidence to the justice committee that an increase in s case have itself exacerbate the backlog of case yet to reach trial mushtaq para certainly new data share with the justice committee inquiry suggest fi that the average length of time between the s recording and case completion have increase signi cantly a the measure have be roll out nationally thomas further investigation be clearly fl need however to be able to ascertain whether these delay be a re ection of broad court congestion a diversion of trial resource to s proceeding or great success in front loading investigation to allow for completion of s s at an early stage it be also note by some of our participant that a complete s hearing could paradoxically reduce the impetus amongst professional to push for a timely trial process a senior crown prosecutor c observe that with case that should be prioritise because there s a vulnerable victim or witness the trial date be actually get bump off far than those which haven t the international journal of evidence proof fi be identi ed a have vulnerable complainant or witness because they ve do their bit this be echo too by individual barrister mushtaq robert as well a the cba in their submis sion to the justice committee with the cba reporting that across their member collective experience court often prioritise trial with live witness mean that s case can be delay a judge con sider the evidence be already in the can cba para in this context senior crown prosecutor c be at pain to highlight during their interview that true closure can not be achieve for trial party until after the verdict regardless of when evidence be capture they explain that this be why i be not keen on s because a they put it if the witness actually just pitch up to the trial give evidence in person they would have have that closure much sooner it be worth underscore here that follow the s hear the witness be of course still unable to discuss the content of their evidence with anyone who be a witness in the case include in the fi case of child their parent which can present substantial dif culties one parent isurf fl re ected on this in a context in which there have be an month delay between their child s s record and their own testimony give at trial they share that not only do they feel unable to properly reconnect with their child during this period but they felt disempowered a a parent from be able to support them in their recovery i kind of felt that i didn t have all the little detail and yet i m her sole carer i m expect to care for her without know everything fi this dif culty be also recognise by a senior district crown prosecutor and head of a rasso unit c who report to u that when there s a parent who be also connect and a witness in that case i m tell by isvas and chisvas particularly chisvas actually that that s create some problem for them because they want to undertake fi work that be for the family and that s very dif cult when you ve get one person who s complete the child have complete their evidence but the adult hasn t this particular consequence be also recognise by the citizen advice witness service in their submission to the justice committee who note that a long gap between the s hearing and the trial may cause particular issue where young family member have give evidence through s but others be require to be witness at the trial this can cause real emo fi tional dif culties within the family exacerbate by the long time line involve citizen advice witness service fl indeed such consideration lead a s lead judge j to re ect that when you speak to people they say what the victim want be closure and they re not get it with s though it may be optimistic to position the criminal justice system a a vehicle for provide closure to victim of rape and serious sexual offence daly herman mcglynn and westmarland munro it be clear in our interview that for some of those who have be involve in s process the experience have be substantially less traumatise than what they have anticipate base fi on their expectation of the adversarial courtroom in this context the bene t both potential and in fi some case realise of s be therefore signi cant for example one mother of a complainant isurf describe her daughter s use of s in her sexual offence trial to the researcher in the fol low way s be absolutely amaze the best thing perhaps to come out of the criminal justice system it take the edge off my daughter have to physically go into a courtroom and give evidence even with the special measure that be put in place it s still intimidate for a young girl all our need be meet and then the good thing about it be that the question be limited munro et al the importance of this ought not to be lose sight of despite concern regard implementation challenge resourcing listing and logistical challenge with child and adult witness alike concern be express by many criminal justice practitioner in our study about the pressure that the expedited timeframes in s case can cause for example a rasso ticket judge j observe that in order to get a s tee up all the thing that normally take several week to achieve have get to be do within a very short period of time that put enormous pressure on lot of different agency they also observe that it require a lot of hand hold a lot of micro manage to make sure thing be do in the right timeframe by the judiciary this front loading be often felt most acutely by the police see also national police chief council and cps a detective constable p for example highlight the requirement that it impose on the police to have get your full schedule together in a much more limited time so a to ensure appropriate disclosure to the defence ahead of any s cross examination this be particularly challenging in the context of already stretch resource across the criminal justice system and an insuf fi fi cient number of specialist rasso police of cer cps lawyer and barrister as well a increase reporting rate and caseloads mushtaq see further king et al interviewee explain that one of the big hurdle in relation to s be around the requirement for early disclosure one rasso barrister c for example express concern about the extent to which this be achieve in practice note the problem with do s case be that quite often you end up with material be disclose after you ve conduct the cross examination that would have have an impact on the way that you cross examine this be echo by j a rasso ticket judge who note that it be more likely to arise a an issue in their view in relation to adult complai fi nants in sexual offence case the dif culty with adult s cross examination be that very often disclos ure of that type phone and other extraneous thing take a lot long and so you run the risk that you may say to the witness right that s the end of your cross examination but then some new evidence come in though it remain formally open to the court to allow further cross examination in order for line of fi question to be put to the witness that might not have previously be identi ed participant indicate there would be considerable reluctance to this in practice not least since a discuss above it would undermine one of the key aim associate with the provision of s which be to give witness some assurance that their role in proceeding be conclude and that they would not later need to come to court a j go on to express it you then have to re address the whole issue of whether the s fi be nite or not these challenge around the requirement of early disclosure in s case particularly involve inti midated witness be also note by jackson et al in their submission to the justice committee inquiry base on research into the changing nature of cross examination they explain how in instance where full disclosure be not make in time for the s hearing there be an obvious reluctance to schedule a second pre record cross examination jackson et al a a result disclosure failure be potentially leave to be address by an admission of agreed fact which could operate to the disadvantage of a complainant who be then not afford the opportunity to give a response to the issue subsequently raise see also cba para which express similar concern another dominant theme across participant contribution be the extent to which s have impose additional demand on court resource and personnel in a context in which there be already acute shortage and overwhelm case backlog to contend with in particular the requirement for continu ity of counsel and the subsequent logistics of ensure that counsel can be available to conduct a s hearing on the scheduled date be challenge the reality be that in most case the permission of a pre side judge in a live trial in which counsel be engage be require to hold over those proceeding and enable counsel to travel elsewhere to conduct the s hearing where this permission be not grant the international journal of evidence proof fi s hearing often have to be delay which undermine their bene t in term of early capture and certainty for witness in the alternative they may proceed but then need to be conduct at short notice by someone other than the designated counsel who will lead the rest of the trial this frustrate the requirement for continuity of counsel and can introduce confusion into the cross examination process in a variety of way include for trial party and the jury indeed the mother of a young com plainant that we interview during our research isurf explain how on the morning of their child s s hear they be inform that the prosecution barrister have change to one they have never meet before this understandably cause anxiety for both her and her child and may have fi reduce the quality of evidence adduce if the barrister have insuf cient time to familiarise themselves with the case whilst the principle of continuity of counsel be important it have place additional strain on court in fi term of be able to predictably and ef ciently list hearing to maximise available resource a one rasso barrister c put it there have be huge listing problem arise a a consequence of the roll out of s nationally and to a wider cohort of witness it be cause all sort of knock on problem to all sort of other trial because you know you ve get to be there in person to do a s and if you re in the middle of a trial somewhere else you ve get to be there in person so it s the judicial equivalent of rob peter to pay paul similarly another rasso barrister c observe that when there be only a few of them it be manageable but substantial shortage of barrister nationally couple with crown court backlog have already put huge pressure on diary and they suggest this have only be compound by the logis tical challenge of s see also mushtaq roberts the judiciary be then task with man age request from counsel to be release from trial to conduct s hearing which often present fi fl signi cant dilemma this be re ected in the observation of j a rasso ticket judge who describe have be ask to excuse counsel from a week horrible familial rape and sexual abuse case and observe that you just think we re juggle compete vulnerability here meanwhile other judge describe the wider availability of s a incredibly disruptive for trial listing and man agement j a rasso ticket judge place enormous pressure on every aspect of the system j a rasso ticket judge and impose a huge burden on court staff j a s lead judge with a resident judge j observe that you shouldn t have a new system implement which require that level of optional cooperation since it be doom to be unsuccessful these concern regard the logistics of attend s hearing and ensure consistency of representation across trial process be clearly acute for professional participant it be apparent however that they be often consider to be less insurmountable when the measure be restrict fi in it availability to vulnerable witness a de ned under s of the yjcea this be partly because of the low volume of case involve such witness but it be also link to the tighter man agement of s in these s case and in particular to the use of grhs to scrutinise the typically write question that defence counsel envisage put to the witness to ensure that they be appro priate in tone and scope do so it be suggest by interviewee encourage a more predictable s fl process a resident judge j re ected for example that what have change be that approach to cross examination of young and vulnerable witness a change they attribute largely to the effect of a robust grh during which the judge will rule out line of cross examination that be really grandstand for the defendant rather than ask pertinent question of the witness this be echo by a chief crown prosecutor c who note in relation to young and vulnerable witness that the cross examination process tend to be more concise see also jackson et al thus s hearing involve vulnerable witness and child can typically be complete fairly quickly with many fi judge list these hearing rst thing in the morning to minimise disruption to other trial they be preside over or counsel be appear in munro et al the position be however currently quite different in relation to intimidate witness whilst it would be open to court to impose a similarly structured process for scrutiny of question intend to be ask of intimidated witness emerge evidence of the early operation of the provision indi cat that this rarely occur kyneswood instead grhs tend to be substantially more perfunc tory with advanced sight or detailed scrutiny of the question intend for adult witness typically perceive to be unnecessary a a s lead judge j put it in relation to s hearing with vul nerable witness all the question be all set out the intermediary approve them and it s just a question of rat a tat tat question be ask we know what the answer be go to be to most they re go to be yes or no and there we go this be contrast directly to the situation of an inti midated adult make a rape allegation who will not be cross examine in the same way with the same fi restriction a a child there may be topic request a oppose to speci c question but it win t go any further than that leave aside concern about the tone or relevance of such question which we return to far below at a practical level j underscore the impact that s go to have on the courtroom that the s be take place in let s say it take two hour rather than half an hour it be just go to cause complete and utter chaos this concern be echo by the cba in their submission to the justice committee inquiry where they opine that the s provision have be paste onto the exist special measure regime with good intention but without the infrastructure to make it work able in practice cba para and note that while s may be an extremely useful tool in some case they be concern that it be be use far too widely in practice with the highly problematic extension to s intimidated witness have compound this issue cba para mediate effect and malfunction technology many participant express concern that the delivery of cross examination via pre record video par ticularly when follow use of a pre record police interview a evidence in chief might dampen the impact of testimony for juror with associated effect on assessment of credibility and sympathy that fl could in uence verdict barrister and judge in particular warn that s run this risk because you re play them an abe which be an initial account and then you re play them a pre record cross examination it s almost a if they re watch a movie c rasso barrister this be con trasted with what be consider to be the much more impressive and poignant c rasso barrister experience of witness give evidence live in the courtroom though several participant felt that the fi risk of juror disassociation may be less substantial in respect of child witness they be con dent that it would be an issue in relation to adult a a s lead judge j put it if you don t have an adult in the courtroom and they re just record i think you do lose the impact of the witness in court it s my gut feeling that juries don t listen the same way a if somebody be in the same room and of course the defendant be present always through the whole trial and they never lose sight of him this be reiterate to u by a rasso ticket judge j who explain that it s much easy to explain to a jury that the reason why they ve have s be because they re a child or because they fi have mental health dif culties but i m not enthusiastic with the whole roll out since it s go to fi be very dif cult to address in judicial direction a to why an adult would require a s rather than give testimony in the standard way such concern around the potentially pejorative impact of not have an adult witness give evidence live in the criminal courtroom be well documented munro a such it be perhaps unsurprising that this issue be raise by several participant in our study as well a be feature in evidence submit by several practitioner cba coeus mushtaq robert and academic jackson et al thomas to the justice committee inquiry the international journal of evidence proof though the cba have opine that jury well understand the fact of a child or a young child be on a recording they have also caution that juror may be less likely to understand this in the case of an fi old child or adult who appear not to have any de ciency in communication or understanding cba para d in this context they suggest that a complainant s make use of pre record evi dence include via s might confer an unintended advantage to the defence cba para recent research evaluate investigative and prosecutorial strategy in rape case in england and wale have far document the tenacity of this perspective amongst many professional stakeholder but it have also highlight the extent to which there may be a grow divergence of view on the matter a between those involve at earlier and later stage of the criminal justice process king et al on the one hand this research which include a series of interview with stakeholder in police the cps and third sector as well a rasso counsel and sex ticket judge report a common view amongst counsel and the judiciary that it be much more impactful for witness to give evidence face to face with the jury king et al however it also document strong endorsement of the use of special measure amongst police and many prosecutor with the tension this can provoke fl re ected poignantly in one comment by a cps review lawyer that i m sick and tired of judge and barrister say that they want the victim in court behind a screen so the jury can see them cry and shake king et al the researcher note that such tension could be particularly acute in respect of s with barrister variously describe it use a dangerous dehumanising and do a disservice to victim by allow ing jury to completely disassociate whilst cps lawyer describe it in line with the cps s submission to the justice committee cps a a revolutionary and brilliant king et al in reality the impact upon the jury result from the use of s by different category of witness and in different type of trial remains uncertain prior research much of it conduct with mock juror via simulation give legal prohibition on research that ask about the content of real jury deliberation have indicate that the removal of witness from the courtroom for example through use of live link testimony could operate to increase the credibility of the complainant for some observer as much a it reduce their perceived credibility for others who find themselves feel more detached ellison and munro taylor and joudo however this work have not typically explore the impact on juror of the compound use of pre record evidence in chief through video record police interview alongside pre record cross examination which be the mode utilised under s emerge research conduct in england and wale explore the effect of s on conviction rate fi have indicate the existence of a potentially signi cant impact and one that operate for vulnerable and intimidated witness alike in the direction of reduce the prospect for conviction when compare to live testimony thomas para indeed thomas have report that in the period from to the jury conviction rate be per cent low overall in case where s be use fi fi with this gure increase in respect of speci c offence and witness category include rape of a child age to per cent and rape of a woman age over per cent thomas fi table these ndings be stark but a thomas acknowledge the extent to which they be best attrib uted to the mode of delivery per se or to the circumstance in which pre record evidence be currently operationalised and or additional barrier to credibility associate with witness for whom use of s may be necessary remains unclear further work to explore the impact of s on juror and thus to good understand what may be drive this apparent shift in conviction outcome be ongoing thomas in those case where special measure include s be use however it will often be precisely because the individual witness be unlikely to be able to withstand give testimony through conventional medium or may be at risk of withdrawal from the process altogether if that be to be their only option thus the counter factual against which the impact of use be to be measure be not one where the witness be necessarily present for or able to give clear and effective evidence live at trial this be emphasise by a senior crown prosecutor c in our research who explain that any concern around potential low conviction rate in s case need to be contrast with the fact munro et al there s be a trial at all at least we ve have our prosecution at least she s have the chance to give evi fi dence in this context ndings from a recent project explore changings form and content of cross examination particularly in rape and sexual offence trial be also instructive reporting that of the trial in which complainant rely on pre record cross examination only result in conviction the researcher note it might be tempt to infer that video link do in practice impact negatively on fi jury they go on to underscore that all thing however be not equal more speci cally they adjudge there be evidential weakness in the prosecution case in each and every one of the video link case and note there be also no high a conviction rate within their sample of observation in case involve screen relative to the cohort that rely on remote form of court testimony jackson et al any data regard the impact of s on conviction must also be situate in the context in which fi potential and realised bene t to the experience of complainant and witness be recognise which include how the provision have be and currently be operationalised a discuss this be one in which numerous obstacle to best practice have be encounter thus any negative fl effect on conviction rate link to use of s might re ect the implementation gap that we expose in this article as much a the mode of delivery per se indeed while senior crown prosecutor c aver that defence lawyer never resist a s application which i think say a lot it be possible that this tell u far more about the shortfall in how pre record evidence be cur rently capture and present in the trial process than about it potential to empower witness to effectively communicate their account to juror certainly a number of interviewee express concern about the adequacy of the equipment use for capture and playback of s recording within courtroom it be suggest this could far dampen the effect c a rasso barrister of complainant testimony because of poor audio and visual quality or a lack of integration across playback medium indeed a circuit judge j note that issue with sound quality could be such that the jury might need to have a transcript or something fi just to follow it but this cause additional dif culties since such transcript be not routinely avail able playback failure be also report the mother of a complainant in our study describe the add itional stress cause when there be technical issue with her daughter s pre record evidence be play to the jury the playback wouldn t work on the day that they plan to do it just wouldn t playback and so then there fi be a lot of faf ng and then decide what they be go to do then because obviously they couldn t do it in the order that they want and it just felt like really we ve wait all this time and now the video don t work isurf fi technological issue of this sort have be identi ed a a consistent challenge in both ministry of justice process evaluation baverstock ward et al as well a in contemporaneous academic research explore s s implementation jackson et al kyneswood and submission by practitioner to the justice committee inquiry cba coeus national police chief council roberts though the scale of the funding challenge fi associate with improve court infrastructure and it equipment to render it t for purpose can not be underestimate the fact that the government have push forward with roll out of s in the absence of a clear strategy for ensure appropriate infrastructure investment and modernisation be in itself problematic in this context it be also worth note that concern about audio visual quality be not restrict to fi s recording concern be frequently express too about whether police abe interview be t for purpose see also mcmillan and thomas westera et al a rasso ticket judge j fi provide an example of a witness be lmed against the background of a sunny window with the con sequence that the jury member could only see their silhouette j also explain the big problem be the international journal of evidence proof fi not be able to hear complainant you can hear the police of cer loud and clear but because they don t want to mic up the witness i think probably because they don t want to appear too formal it often mean you can t hear the witness properly where witness make use of s they have already provide their evidence in chief through an abe video record police interview the conjoined effect of poor quality recording and playback across both medium may be particularly damaging poten tially reduce the ability of juror to follow understand and connect with their testimony thus a kyneswood recently put it when draw on her research into the operation of s for intimidated wit ness in her submission to the justice committee inquiry while judge and barrister be concern that juror may disconnect from video evidence or treat it like a soap opera there be a basis for argue instead that the experience of view pre record testimony should be more like tv not less in the sense of demand improved audio visual quality kyneswood para the ongoing use of the abe a evidence in chief in s case be raise by the cps in their recent justice committee submission who note that an alternative would be to collect the victim or witness account by write statement or by video record interview but to then pre record both the examination in chief and the cross examination in one hearing cps a see also coeus para this may go some way towards address concern about abe quality which inter vening research on the prosecutorial handling of rape complaint in england and wale have similarly con fi rmed to be frequent and well ground with judge in particular variously describe abes a chaotic confuse appalling and abysmal king et al however it introduce alter native challenge for example by increase scope for inconsistency real or apparent to emerge across witness account and without substantial investment in the technology to store playback and display recording to juror in courtroom such a move be also unlikely in itself to overcome all con cerns regard poor audio visual quality and it consequence other technological issue be report by professional participant in our study most frequently asso ciated with the centralised system in place for record storing and play back s hearing participant fl explain that the need to pre book a timeslot to record and playback a s hearing be impractical in ex fl ible and do not re ect the complex reality of hearing within the court see also jackson et al a a rasso ticket judge j put it the book system be impracticable you know you have to book a particular slot so if anybody s delay you re stuffed or if an issue arise a point of law or something like that if you lose your slot you miss your slot and that include for playback as well j go on to explain that once a trial be list playback slot need to be book month in advance we have to decide now when it s go to be replay to the jury and the trial be list in july of next year so fi counsel have to sort out right who be i gon na call rst how long do i think they re gon na take can we guarantee that we ll have a jury at o clock on the monday morning can we guarantee there won t be any issue of law that might arise or anything like that even once a recording slot be book and the s hearing complete a rasso ticket judge j fl re ected on how recording in their court and the wider court premise have often fail my technol ogy fail more time than it doesn t we ve all have a non record recording and i ve only do four or fi fi ve of them far dif culties be also raise by a rasso barrister c in relation to access the record cross examination ahead of time to check that it s audible it s watchable there be no problem with it and to suggest any edits c say the process have be unnecessarily complicate with an fi awful lot of chase and xing behind the scene to secure access from the external provider who be responsible for retention of recording and who be describe by j a resident judge a fi useless c conclude that this have make an easy job unnecessarily dif cult similar sentiment fl be also re ected in submission make to the justice committee inquiry with the s technology label a archaic by one rasso barrister robert and the edit process describe a onerous and time consuming by another mushtaq munro et al silver bullet and second chance fi notwithstanding the potential bene t of s for witness in term of recall avoidance of re traumatisation and recovery and irrespective of the extent to which resourcing logistical and techno logical challenge could be overcome to improve the measure s operation in practice a number of parti cipants be keen to underscore that it availability should not be frame a any kind of silver bullet to longstanding and much lament challenge face the investigation and prosecution of rasso case in england and wale behind such contribution be often an evident concern that the provision have fi be roll out nationally to intimidated witness without suf cient consideration and this have be precipitate by political pressure to respond to the decline in charge and conviction rate and an asso fi ciated crisis in public con dence that have also prompt the end to end rape review in a a rasso barrister in our study c put it the theory be great but again it s be politicise fi there s a desire for quick x without anyone ask any awkward question for many participant such awkward question include demand great scrutiny of and account ability by police and the cps in relation to the timeliness with which case be investigate charge and build for prosecution and the appropriateness or otherwise of decision make regard disclosure strat egies and charge threshold a one rasso barrister c explain in regard to the early handling of case by police there need to be more resource in term of the investigation that take place com plaint be make and quite often they ll make the abe video but then they win t charge someone for an age it s month before they get round to do it because there simply aren t the resource in this context the push to expedite justice outcome by bring forward the point of complainant fi cross examination through s recording could be argue to be wide of the more signi cant need to facilitate timely investigation another rasso prosecutor c recount a case involve two child complainant who have wait month from the date of their abe interview before the case reach the court and counsel even have an opportunity to request cross examination via s they explain whilst it can be expedite effectively once it get to the court what need to be expedite be the whole process between complaint and charge the cps and police have to put the resource into get those case expedite through the system it be suggest too by participant that the implica fi tions of this may be particularly signi cant in the context of adult intimidated witness give the nature of many such investigation involve contest claim regard consent and the increase likelihood of them require more extensive disclosure a a rasso ticket judge j put it for example for many people and i m not talk or year old for which i absolutely accept in those tiny tiny number of case the idea that they can be cross examined sooner be obviously an advantage but actually if you think about download phone and check facebook and get medical record and school record you re not go to get to a s hearing very much quick than a properly run prosecution across police force and cps area in england and wale there have be a concerted effort under the banner of operation soteria to improve the timeliness and effective progression of investigation and prosecution in adult rape case evaluation of those initiative indicate that a combination of increase use by police of early advice from the cps to delineate the scope of reasonable line of inquiry along side improve mechanism for monitor the completion of action plan and ensure more effective escalation of concern in case where timeliness target be not be meet have ensure some improve ment king et al the structure that support this have now also be incorporate a stand ard practice in refreshed national operating model for rape launch by both police college of policing and the cps crown prosecution service b in it be nevertheless abundantly fi clear that resourcing and capacity remain signi cant challenge and that without substantial and sustain able investment the prospect of continued improvement in relation to the timeliness of investigation charge decision and trial preparation will be remote the introduction of s can not therefore the international journal of evidence proof fi offer any quick x solution to these deeply entrenched issue despite policy rhetoric which several par ticipants felt too often suggested otherwise fi return to the silver bullet analogy one of the key bene t associate with s have be the potential for it to transform the tone content and experience of testimony give a with all special mea sures s be intend to recognise and respond to the need of the witness ameliorate where possible those aspect of give testimony in an adversarial environment that be apt to cause distress this be par ticularly critical where these issue might be so acute a to prevent the witness from be able to give an effective account research have demonstrate that such incursion into the adversarial norm of the court room be often welcome by witness burton et al an appreciation echo by several of our participant however it be important to recall that change to the timing and mode of cross examination do not in and of themselves bring change to tone and content in respect of vulnerable and child wit nesses the standardised use of grhs to consider the structure and length of cross examination and scru tinise question in advance can ensure a more transformative effect for these complainant when give evidence this be note for example by a chief crown prosecutor c who explain that i think fi the cross examination process tend to be more concise the bad old day when i rst start prosecute fi this stuff you just don t see that you see more concise evidence give which i think be bene cial to all concern however a note above it be far from clear that a similar process be routinely undertaken in grhs in respect of intimidated witness jackson et al or that the majority of legal professional would consider it necessary appropriate or feasible to do so kyneswood para indeed the cba s submission to the justice committee suggest that not every case should require the defence fi to provide chapter and verse of the cross examination to the court and argue that speci cally in rela tion to a s witness or an adult who for all other purpose be capable save they be nervous about give evidence which be often couch in term of fear and distress there be little need for compel counsel to provide question in advance of the s hearing cba para c ii and iii this framing of the distress encounter by such witness a often be about mere nerve at the prospect of give testimony may well diminish inappropriately the potential for re traumatisation that fl researcher have suggest attend the adversarial trial process in so do though it may also re ect fi the professional ambivalence that we have identi ed above regard the appropriateness of s and asso ciated protection be make available to adult intimidated witness in the same way a for child and vulnerable witness recent research observe the cross examination of adult intimidate witness in fi both s and non s sexual offence case have identi ed certain substantive effect a a consequence of the use of pre record cross examination include a slow and calm pace to counsel question as require to increase the prospect for effective video capture kyneswood however that research have also indicate that the type of question pose their tone substance and potential for re traumatisation remain largely unaffected kyneswood para meanwhile jackson et al have recently report that though hectoring of the witness be not a common feature in their trial observation the tactic of use comment disguise a question be still common in cross examination even of vulnerable wit ness and particularly so in respect of vulnerable adult where per cent of question be determine to be declarative in form compare to less than per cent of question to child under the age of jackson et al and this highlight that the s measure may not be the panacea that it have sometimes be suggest to be particularly for intimidated witness nevertheless in a context in which there be acknowledge challenge associate with secure con victions in rasso case tie amongst other thing to victim reluctance to participate in an adversarial and intimidate criminal trial and concern about the predictability and reliability of juror decision fi making there be further bene t associate with the extended use of s in term of facilitate a second chance at justice that should be acknowledge a senior crown prosecutor c for example recount experience with a recent rape case that do not qualify at the time for s provision in which a very weird really ropey jury return a hung after send question to the judge during deliberation which indicate victim blaming of the complainant for get into the taxi where she munro et al be allegedly rap by the driver rather than walk home alone we go for a retrial and our com plainant about six week out from trial have a nervous breakdown she couldn t go through the process again and the case have to be abandon but if there have be a s we would have never have that problem and that s a big deal while the frequency with which jury in rape case will be unable to reach a verdict should not be overstate another senior crown prosecutor c likewise observe that fi s can be bene cial in give a second bite of the cherry if you like in such circumstance because we ve get the video interview and cross examination in it recent submission to the justice committee the cba agree that this ability to use a pre record cross examination in the event of a trial collapse or a hung jury be one of the most compelling argument in favour of s whilst also note that the statutory basis for this be unclear with no bespoke rule of court in place to deal with it use in a retrial cba para e this may raise complicated question in case where complainant wish to withdraw their support for or involvement in prosecution after have give s evidence or where a trial involve s recording have result in mixed verdict where complai nants remain supportive however this certainly provide an opportunity for seek justice at retrial with fi less potential for re traumatisation and so may be signi cant fi our ndings also suggest that though not perhaps what be envisage when the special measure be fi rst create s can offer scope for additional innovation when seek way to improve complainant experience and justice outcome in the context of a justice system stretch to capacity a s lead judge j recount for example a case that have to be cut short because the defendant have covid and be unable to attend although not initially a s case the judge explain i be really worried that the four young woman in that case all vulnerable witness all under the age of eight een would potentially have to go all through this again and so i take the decision with the assistance of counsel that we would simply get their evidence in the can and we would do it by s which we do the additional trauma often experience by complainant when trial be pause delayed or do not go ahead at the last minute be well know burman and brook hay rape crisis england and wale while a discussed early there be scepticism amongst participant regard the extent to which a blanket increase in the use of s by vulnerable and or intimidate witness would be likely to substantially reduce delay and backlog a this example by j demonstrate it fl allow a degree of exibility that sometimes in unpredictable way can be rely upon to avoid unneces sary and distress rupture in complainant justice journey conclusion a the justice committee continue to consider the submission to it inquiry into the operation of s of the youth justice and criminal evidence act and research explore the effect of it usage on case outcome across england and wale continue vulnerable and intimidated witness be require to fi evaluate ideally with the bene t of information and guidance from police prosecutor and specialist support or witness service the merit and demerit of make use of pre record cross examination there be inevitably a number of consideration to weigh in that balance it be clear that there be poten fi fi tially signi cant bene t associate with the use of s for complainant and witness however there be also substantial variability in how s be operationalised and it use respond to by professional and this map amongst other thing to the category of witness type of case level of scrutiny of question quality of technology courtroom infrastructure and listing or capacity challenge the long awaited implementation of s be in our view welcome and our discussion in this article should not be take a supportive of move to pause or abandon it usage but there be a legitimate basis for concern regard the pace at which it have be roll out the rigour of performance evaluation to date and the adequacy of it implementation the international journal of evidence proof whilst the principle underpin the introduction of s be important and admirable and be support by the majority of participant in this research it be clear that policy rhetoric have too often over reach in it claim around s a a silver bullet to the complex issue face the investigation and prosecution of rasso case indeed against the backdrop of a pronounced lack of investment in crim inal justice process personnel and infrastructure in england and wale along with acute challenge result from increase court backlog and attrition of legal professional at an unprecedented rate our research evidence a series of grounded practical and often legitimate concern regard the oper ationalising of s and indeed associate special measure such a abe pre record police interview the ministry of justice process evaluation focus predominantly on pilot court have yield some useful insight but a a rasso ticket judge j highlight the problem with the roll out of s be that the court that be the pilot court be heavily fund with judge who i have enormous respect for but who verge on the zealot on the subject further insight have also now be glean through evidence submit to the recent justice committee inquiry nevertheless a more rounded evaluation be clearly still require one that pay close attention to the scale of variation between current potential and optimal mode of implementation as well a to the need and experience of witness in all their diver sity without this we would argue that there be a risk of retreat too readily from use of s for fear of it unintended negative effect or conversely of push forward too enthusiastically notwithstanding the fi insuf ciency of support infrastructure and resource either way the consequence will be a j put it that the story of s s design and implementation could become one of a a well meaning disaster for individual and justice system alike fl declaration of con icting interest fl the author declare no potential con icts of interest with

relative to comparison group psychosocial intervention do not seem to increase dropout from treatment or adverse event effect compare to control however the number of dropout and study attrition be generally high potentially miss harm of exposure to intervention and or research participation also the differential effect of specific intervention type need further investigation we conclude that a range of behavioural and cbt base intervention may improve the mental health of survivor of rape sexual assault and sexual abuse in the short term therefore the need and preference of individual must be consider in select suitable approach to therapy and support the primary outcome in this review focus on the post treatment period and the question about whether benefit be sustain over time persists however attain such evidence from study that lack an active comparison may be impractical and even unethical thus we suggest that study undertake head to head comparison of different intervention type in particular of novel emerge therapy with one year plus follow up period additionally researcher should focus on the therapeutic benefit and cost for subpopulation such a male survivor and those live with complex ptsd p l a i n l a n g u a g e s u m m a r y how helpful to recovery and healing be support and psychological intervention after exposure to sexual violence and

systematic review publish by john wiley son ltd on behalf of the cochrane collaboration cochrane trust evidence inform decision library good health cochrane database of systematic review our review suggest that intervention do not worsen symptom or lead to unwanted effect however a large number of participant drop out of treatment or do not complete study assessments these finding be unclear more recent study be good at report information about participant safety and reason why survivor do not complete treatment or health and wellbeing assessment after the intervention a the study bring diverse group of participant together future research be need to improve understand about which intervention be most suited to particular group of survivor include those with long term or complex trauma as well a men and gender minority emerge intervention which have potential to expand treatment choice for survivor also warrant more evaluation what be sexual violence and abuse sexual violence and abuse mean any sexual activity or act that happen without consent it include rape sexual assault sexual abuse and sexual harassment it cause emotional and physical health problem that can be long last the effect be often make bad by fear shame feeling of self blame and the negative response of others how be sexual violence and abuse treat survivor have a range of physical sexual health and forensic care need in the aftermath of rape sexual assault or abuse psychosocial intervention may be offer in response to these need at different stage in survivor recovery journey some intervention aim to assist survivor by carefully re expose them to aspect of the original trauma to process what happen e g trauma focus cognitive behavioural therapy cbt other treatment focus less on the traumatic memory instead help survivor cope with life after abuse e g different form of counsel education about mental health and support for a range of need what do we want to find out we want to know whether psychosocial intervention help to relieve the mental health impact experience by survivor a a result of rape sexual assault or sexual abuse in adulthood we also want to know if some type of intervention be more helpful than others what do we do we search for study compare the effect of psychosocial intervention for individual who have be subject to rape sexual assault or sexual abuse from the age of year with a control group a group of participant who do not receive the intervention but instead be give their usual care be place on a wait list for treatment or receive very minimal assistance such a leaflet we look for difference between group on trauma and depression symptom after receive the intervention dropout from intervention non completion and any unwanted effect relate to the intervention or research about the study and their participant we find study that place consent adult participant by chance into an intervention or a control group participant be invite from a range of setting community university place where people seek help for their mental health sexual trauma e g specialist sexual assault centre and emergency department or for problem that occur alongside the experience of sexual violence e g primary care clinic and via medium request the study include survivor only be men sixty per cent of participant be black or from a minority ethnic or

study from australia canada the netherlands spain sweden and the uk five study do not disclose a funding source those that do report public funding over half the intervention be cbt base support be mostly deliver one to one by trained mental health professional and vary between and session what do we find survivor who participate in a psychosocial intervention may experience a large reduction in ptsd and depression symptom soon after the intervention be complete non completion be not more common among survivor who experience intervention compare to control group but this be base on a small number of study psychosocial intervention may not increase the risk of unwanted effect only seven study report unwanted effect suggest most researcher may not have actively monitor the negative impact of intervention or participation in the study what be the limitation of the evidence we have little confidence in the result because of concern about the level of variation across the study e g type of survivor experience wide range of intervention and study size it be possible that the allocation of survivor to one group or another may not have be entirely random furthermore survivor who do not

intervention effect be more different from each other than one would expect dichotomous data due to random error chance alone while primary and secondary outcome be usually assess with continuous

q statistic separate the study base on whether they share the we require mean and standard deviation by study arm for same design or not we assess statistical heterogeneity with the study that report continuous outcome when study use different outcome measure to assess the same construct we chi test which provide u with evidence of variation in effect calculate standardised mean difference smd and

with a range of tool see type of outcome measure participant or trial so we set our p value at deeks across study and that we would largely be calculate smd and assessed heterogeneity use the i

systematic review unit of analysis issue of intervention deeks where to might not be important to may represent moderate heterogeneity study with multiple treatment group to may represent substantial heterogeneity and when study compare multiple eligible experimental to show considerable heterogeneity we take into intervention with a single control group we split the control consideration the size and direction of effect and the strength of group to enable pairwise comparison this lead to have more evidence for heterogeneity use the chi test and the ci for comparison than study for continuous outcome we split the i with a small number of study both the i confidence sample size by the number of eligible experimental condition but interval and the q test should be interpret very cautiously keep the mean and standard deviation consistent for dichotomous huedo medina outcome we split the sample size and the number of event by the number of eligible experimental condition if study use

to june only appendix unused method randomise cross over trial have we find cross over trial we would have apply the same approach a recommend in section of the cochrane handbook for systematic review of intervention higgins b a discuss in section in the handbook this would involve use the variant of the cochrane risk of bias tool design specifically for cross over trial this would have help address some of the key issue when assess risk of bias in cross over trial include bias arise from the randomisation process bias due to deviation from intend intervention bias due to miss outcome data bias in measurement of the outcome and bias in selection of the report outcome continuous data have study use the same continuous outcome measure we would have calculate the mean difference md with confidence interval ci we would have present conceptually distinct outcome in separate forest plot have it be necessary to combine dichotomous data and continuous data in a meta analysis we would have need estimate of the standard error standard error could have be compute for all study by enter the data into revman a dichotomous and continuous outcome type data a appropriate and convert the ci for the result log odds ratio and standardise mean difference smd into standard error lefebvre once we have compute the smd or log odds ratio and their standard error for all study in the meta analysis we would have combine them use the generic inverse variance method in revman review manager cluster randomise trial there be one include cluster trial bass however this be not include in the meta analysis due to the nature of the comparison have we identify cluster randomise trial eligible for the meta analysis we would have adjust the standard error or sample size use the method describe in the cochrane handbook for systematic review of intervention higgins b a described in section in the handbook the adjustment method would have require the following information from the study the number of cluster or group randomise to each intervention group and the total number of participant in the study the outcome data ignore the cluster design for the total number of individual and an estimation of intracluster or intraclass correlation coefficient icc this would have enable an approximately correct analysis to be perform have the icc not be available we would have use icc from analogous cluster randomise trial if analogous study have not be available we would have use a series of plausible value in a sensitivity analysis an approximately correct analysis would proceed to reduce the size of each trial to it effective sample size by divide by the design effect for continuous data only the sample size need to be reduce for dichotomous data the number of participant and those experience the event should be divide by the same design effect deal with miss data we would have estimate the log rank statistic where these be not publish in an article and we would have use previously report method where applicable parmar tierney we would have address the potential impact of miss outcome data in the risk of bias assessment if appropriate we would have perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the miss information on our result see sensitivity analysis below use the method describe in the cochrane handbook for systematic review of intervention deeks data synthesis have it be inappropriate to combine the data in a meta analysis on account of insufficient study or data we would have report the effect size with ci or standard error of individual study and provide a narrative rather than quantitative summary of the finding that address the following aspect what be the direction of effect what be the size of effect be the effect consistent across study subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity a describe in chapter of the cochrane handbook for systematic review of intervention deeks metaregression be an extension to subgroup analysis that allow the effect of continuous as well a categorical characteristic to be investigate and in principle allow the effect of multiple factor to be investigate simultaneously generally metaregression should not be consider when there be few than study in a meta analysis have there be more than study available we would have use metaregression technique recommend for stata harbord stata participant characteristic have be identify a integral to subgroup analysis a there may be difference in the efficacy of treatment for different group of individual however we be aware that subgroup analysis of subset of participant be challenge because sufficient detail to extract data about separate participant type be seldom publish in report recruitment setting have also be identify as important a there may be difference between survivor recruit via mental health clinic a oppose to in the community or acute sexual assault service intensity of intervention be also of

database of systematic review publish by john wiley son ltd on behalf of the cochrane collaboration cochrane trust evidence inform decision library good health cochrane database of systematic review psychological therapy versus intervention orient towards provision of psychosocial support finally it would have be important to stratify analysis by type of intervention give their distinct mechanism and theoretical underpinnings have we find sufficient study we would have conduct the follow subgroup analysis participant characteristic e g gender ethnicity time to treatment symptom load and type of trauma exposure intensity of intervention e g up to four session five or more session mode of intervention delivery e g individual versus group and setting of recruitment or intervention delivery healthcare community acute setting sensitivity analyse we would have perform the following sensitivity analysis provide there be sufficient number of study to examine any effect on the overall outcome re analysis of the data exclude study with miss outcome data additional sensitivity analysis would have be require if particular issue relate to the study under review have arise for example if icc be

this review d i f f e r e n c e s b e t w e e n p r o t o c o l a n d r e v i e w in our protocol brown we list stress inoculation training sit prolong exposure therapy pet and cognitive processing therapy cpt a example of integrative therapy base on our reading of description of these intervention in the literature we use to guide the development of our review however when we start to categorise the intervention identify in study that meet our review criterion we find that not all easily fit with category of the former cochrane depression anxiety and neurosis group ccdan list of psychological therapy we therefore consult expert and clinical psychologist for guidance and conclude that we have previously miscategorised sit pet and cpt which may be good categorise a cognitive behavioural therapy in addition trauma focus intervention compare to non trauma focus be an aspect we raise a important in the protocol it be recognise that the main comparison combine all intervention type in one and that it may be more useful to stakeholder to understand effect by type thus depend on availability of data we will stratify result use primary outcome for cbt versus inactive control and behavioural therapy versus inactive control present these in additional table however we have not clearly describe trauma focused intervention in the protocol hence we edit the description of the intervention section in light of our increased learning in the topic and our previous oversight and use these update categorisation throughout the review in the protocol we state we would include all time point but that the primary time point for treatment efficacy would be three month post treatment the selection of this time point have be base on a scoping review do at the outset of the research however in the process of select study for inclusion it become clear that the majority assess treatment efficacy at post treatment in the day and week follow treatment and three month be much less common we still conduct meta analysis base on the outcome at three month however ultimately post treatment outcome be report in summary of finding psychosocial intervention for survivor of rape and sexual assault experience during adulthood review copyright the author cochrane database of systematic review publish by john wiley son ltd on behalf of the cochrane collaboration cochrane trust evidence inform decision library good health cochrane database of systematic review in the protocol we intend to extract sexual identity but this be rarely mention in any study and be not ultimately list among the characteristic of included study in the review we list additional feature for extraction than initially include in the protocol these change include add information about intervention such a format of delivery theoretical basis for the intervention fidelity mean number of session take up by participant and completion rate we be more precise in the review about the difference between dropout and non completion dropout indicate the number of participant who do not complete outcome assessment evaluation non completion refer to the number of participant allocate to an intervention group that do not receive the intervention or access a minimum number of intervention session predefined by individual study a the dose require for completion we differentiate between study set and recruitment set these difference be implement so that the data extract accurately reflect what be report in the included study and could be synthesise across all study the review unlike the protocol specify a minimum number of included study require to perform meta analysis we perform a meta analysis if there be three or more study this be select a a threshold give the potential for a very large number of analysis across our four time point and primary and secondary outcome i n d e x t e r m s medical subject heading mesh behavior therapy cognitive behavioral therapy method

mhealth uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purpose xsl fo renderx jmir mhealth and uhealth whelan et al feasibility of the technology qualitative insight it be fine though i think it s brilliant i forget it be even there and in fact i m a bit lose without it now participants evaluate the technology a main theme and it s not there it be quite strange female gpa discuss the usability wearability reliability durability preference privacy and cost a subthemes additional quote it be more about that but when i have the glucose to support the described subthemes be present in multimedia monitor on for a start when it be hot i put appendix sleeveless on but then i be get what s that what s that what s that so i start wear thing usability with just sleeve on female pa gpa participant generally find both technology easy to use in because i have get all these lovely watch at home particular how they find the fitbit easy to charge and be that i can t wear because i have get that somebody complimentary about the battery life comment relate to at work have get one of those on i notice she have get apply the freestyle libre emphasize the initial trepidation it on her other hand she have get her watch on one felt by the participant mostly because of the visible needle hand and her fitbit on other hand i think well and concern that the insertion process would be painful across that s one way of do it but i couldn t wear it on all group however there be a pleasant surprise with which there female gpa the freestyle libre adhere to the skin and this nervousness typically subside follow the first application the reliability requirement of scan the freestyle libre at least every some participant question the glucose level provide by the hour to avoid data loss be highlight a a flaw with the freestyle libre when it classify them a low or in the red technology a some participant forget to scan regularly enough when this be not normally the case they tend to attribute and several participant notice period of miss data during this observation to the timing of use a new sensor or alter sleep the location of the freestyle libre on the arm when talk i think it be all very straightforward all very easy about the fitbit the accuracy of the data provide by the female gpa technology be question by the participant across all group specifically for step count calorie distance mode of i can take it off at night and charge it at night so activity stair climb heart rate and sleep during mask there s no issue with that i put it on charge every fitbit wear very few problem with automatic syncing be second night really charge a fitbit last about five revealed but during unmasked period many participant day so if i put it on every second night it be fine report the need for multiple attempt at manually sync the never have no issue with it run out at all male fitbit similarly multiple attempt be sometimes need to pa gpa scan the freestyle libre i be pleasantly surprise that it didn t hurt when i i think when i first get it it be quite low actually for first saw the thing i think god this be go to be the first well for the first day it be below the and awful and hurt my arm but i couldn t believe how i be think ooh but then it go down to the normal painless it be female gpa sort of range and actually the last one a week ago when you go to sleep seven hour isn t all that long and the same thing actually that s be low i don t really you generally need more than seven hour know if it s the device or if i ve do something sleep and not everybody would wake up in the night different or what female g gpa i do but not everybody would so that wasn t quite i think sometimes it s be quite generous with step long enough female gpa turn around to get the towel be give me steps wearability and some day it say you ve walked x mile and i think i can t have some day it s tell me i ve the majority of the participant find the freestyle libre walk eleven mile and i think have i walk comfortable with many forget the sensor be there eleven mile eleven mile be quite a so i m not particularly participant in group g gpa and gpa a few sure it s accurate to that extent male g gpa indicate issue with skin irritation from the tegaderm and have trouble apply the sensor correctly the issue with i have a couple of issue sometimes it s a bit difficult the wearability of the sensor appear to relate more to participant to link it to my phone it just take a bit of be self conscious about wear the sensor with some perseverance rather than everything happen on resort to cover it up with additional or alternative clothing one flick of the screen it might take two or three and others suggest refinement to the sensor and tegaderm minute just to catch on the bluetooth it s not a major similarly participant across all group note that the design issue it s just a little niggle that s probably a good of the fitbit could be improve in particular participant word male pa gpa suggest align the design with traditional watch and for durability some this issue mean they be not pleased when ask to replace their exist jewelry with the fitbit reason for several participant speak about their experience of have the discomfort be also relate to the impact of temperature on freestyle libre sensor fall off and in part this be because the fitbit strap they be get less aware of wear it a time go on more http mhealth jmir org e jmir mhealth uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purpose xsl fo renderx jmir mhealth and uhealth whelan et al so for participant in g gpa and gpa particular reason note when you have eat something so you could then align i mean in the end you didn t really need report by participant include walk into door frame to because you could see the pattern for yourself catch the freestyle libre sensor on clothing or shower and but to start with that s useful that you could put in perspiration weaken the sensor s attachment participant when you have eat something or put a note in of also raise annoyance about the memory of the freestyle libre some sort which be helpful female pa gpa suggest that the memory be not sufficient and perhaps if it last a day or two it would avoid some of the data loss a i have actually enjoy the glucose monitor result some participant keep forget to scan it regularly look at the graph and chart more than the fitbit female gpa i catch one on the car doorframe when i be get something in and out of the car the other one i i could have delve a lot more deeply into the fitbit walk into a doorframe and catch it and it just bent but i be more interested in the app and the glucose the needle and it stop work male gpa level i ve never monitor my glucose before and i be fascinate by the whole thing i be amaze i think it might have a good memory last a day how the device work and all sort of thing about or two but because i keep forget to because i be it male g gpa so busy i just keep forget to scan it so there be gap and also at night time i go to bed like cost o clock at night time and then get up sort of hour several participant express their concern about the cost of later after a really good sleep and there be huge the freestyle libre sensor if they be to buy them in gap male g gpa particular because they only last week which would restrict privacy many people from access this technology participant discuss the topic of privacy explain how they it be a lot i be sure they will come down a people do not mind or have any problem with have data collect use them more and more but and they only last two on how much they use their phone and the study apps during week so you know it be a lot of money female the study period some participant mention that this be pa gpa mainly because they have nothing to hide others raise concern acceptability of the technology quantitative insight about other apps and their monitoring activity such a google map which capture a lot of information about user location during the week of participant provided day of valid fitbit wear with all participant average a total it be interest that you could have all this stuff of sd valid day compliance with sync the fitbit go on on your phone but it also be a bit spooky a data note that participant receive a prompt from well because people be watch your performance the researcher to sync encourage data transfer whereas i suppose that in real life can be quite scary it be and participant receive anyway you don t know who s watch you at any or prompt respectively in term of charge the point female gpa fitbit participant receive a prompt to charge the preference fitbit a battery status reach no data loss be record for the fitbit across the group the level of data participant describe access an array of feedback metric capture for the freestyle libre be high an average of for their activity prefer fitbit feature be typically step sd and sd in the first and sixth week count and heart rate with calorie burn consider the least respectively and this be relatively consistent between the meaningful there be conflict remark about the fitbit group multimedia appendix prompt the associated motivational message be see a childish and receive the notification to move hourly be there be no clear trend toward increased physical activity over deem too frequent nonphysical activity feature such a food the week use step count active minute number of flight log and relaxation be not use as often or consider a of stair or reduction in the number of reminder to move useful a the physical activity feature of the fitbit this be multimedia appendix similarly there be no improvement typically because of the manual entering of data require on the in interstitial glucose level use time in range multimedia app or preference for use alternative apps the freestyle libre appendix feature be talk about positively by participant with no acceptability of the trial qualitative insight clear preference for the feedback provide a suggested improvement be for great flexibility in view historical participant evaluate the study design a main data there be an overall preference toward the freestyle libre theme specifically have a positive experience want compare with the fitbit mostly because of the novelty of full access to feedback in particular participant in the group monitor glucose level regardless of group g gpa and pa gpa indicate the study duration be too short have issue with the eligibility criterion and be i d quite often look at my heartbeat because that be uncertain of what be expect of them a subthemes the most interesting thing on there male gpa additional quote to support the described subthemes be it give you those daily report which be helpful present in multimedia appendix and i think it be helpful that you could add in a http mhealth jmir org e jmir mhealth uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purpose xsl fo renderx jmir mhealth and uhealth whelan et al there be an overall sense of positivity in take part in the suggested that receive more instruction on how to use and study indeed participant want access to the information interpret the feedback would have be useful whereas others provide by the technology with some explain their be happy about not be give too much guidance and felt frustration of have device mask and others describe their that the instruction give be clear that say participant disappointment with not be in gpa the week duration explain how explicitly be tell to be more active or to eat differently would have leave them well place to act on the of the study be deem not long enough by some participant feedback other suggestion include direct people to source to gain a full understanding of the relationship between their of information and be able to compare their glucose level lifestyle and glucose represent normal life set more challenging against a healthy profile via the freestyle libre app fitbit goal or try out different wear location for the freestyle libre perhaps a bit more detailed again just how to just sort of really make the best use of it would be good i really enjoy it i really learn a lot from it male female pa gpa g gpa there s not really that much information to go with yes i be really pleased that i be in the six week the monitor to tell you how to interpret the data group because i think that will give me a lot to go male gpa on whereas two week be kind of neither here nor there i think six week be a reasonable amount of but the researcher do say at the start use this a time to assess thing i think that be good for me you want it s your your thing to use a you want so and it lead me to sort of draw some conclusion about that be good male g gpa glucose and how i be use it female gpa technology usage it be difficult to do that over six week perhaps over from week to the group g gpa and gpa spent a low several month you might be able to pin it down to what you eat and when you eat it perhaps keep a amount of time on the freestyle libre app go from to food and exercise diary and link them together min per day and to min per day respectively but we weren t ask to do that female gpa table pa gpa participant log min per day in week and min per day in week a similar pattern be some participant suggest that the freestyle libre might be observe for the freestyle libre app whereby participant in well suit to individual at great risk of develop t d group pa gpa and gpa observe a reduction in time spend or people already with a diagnosis of diabetes only include on the fitbit app reduce from to min per day and individual with a compatible android smartphone be to min per day respectively similarly participant in highlight a an important limitation of the study g gpa reduce their app usage from week to from i say to the researcher you would have to change to min per day the only week when they could access it what app you use or something because i think you potentially would get a lot more people involve with the average number of scan decline over time across all it if it be compatible with an iphone as well female group figure in the group g gpa and gpa participant gpa log on average scan per day in week and scan per day in week across week and participant in there be uncertainty on front change behavior and pa gpa conduct scan per day and scan per day engage with the technology there be some uncertainty respectively a number of fitbit monitor unexpectedly restore around whether participant felt that the study require them to to default setting during deployment result in syncs be change their behavior or whether it be purely a monitoring or complete automatically data collection exercise a total of of participant change of the if i have be tell like what we be look for be you physical activity goal from the default setting of these to increase your activity because we be after this participant change the daily step goal whereas certain we be try to see this thing then i would the number of floor active minute calorie and distance goal have go for it male g gpa be change by and there be also inconsistency in participant perception of participant respectively notably the daily step goal how much to engage with the technology some individual be reduce by participant http mhealth jmir org e jmir mhealth uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purpose xsl fo renderx jmir mhealth and uhealth whelan et al table pattern of

sector to collectively consider when consider the use of commercially available technology in health to the author knowledge this be the first study to deploy both research these include the follow the need to integrate behavioral and physiological self monitor digital health or facilitate the integration of information collect by technology to individual at risk of develop t d use of behavioral and physiological sensor into a single platform and the device reduce over the week intervention period but provide intelligent feedback and automate actionable remain high than the minimum level of use need to avoid insight by use multiple data source in real time data loss eg scan the freestyle libre every hour despite limitation with smartphone compatibility it be technology usage feasible to conduct the study with a high uptake rate and full participant be give minimal instruction a to how to engage retention of participant at the end of the trial the study and with the technology in an effort to reflect an off the shelf technology be acceptable to individual at risk of t d deployment there be reduce use of the fitbit and freestyle libre over the week intervention period which be similar between the group this suggest that the provision of both http mhealth jmir org e jmir mhealth uhealth vol iss e p page number not for citation purpose xsl fo renderx jmir mhealth and uhealth whelan et al technology do not clearly impact the honeymoon period or which be where further technological development may still the novelty effect frequently observe when people newly access play a key role digital health technology for the freestyle libre the feasibility of the trial and technology magnitude of this novelty effect be different between time eligibility of individual complete the web base risk survey spend on the app and the frequency of scan scan per day be low with of those who be ineligible for the reduce by approximately between week and week study classify a have a low risk of develop t d and whereas time spend on the app decrease by to for have a noncompatible smartphone therefore this both group access the freestyle libre for the full week recruitment approach

and make the behaviour more likely to occur this be illustrate below in figure figure a dynamic cycle intervention drive excellence a a behaviour lead to improve outcome and reinforce the cycle by strengthen the source of behaviour final version december page of divergent case two organisation report divergent activity and perception although both organisation have qi programme in place these programme experience challenge and report no tangible output or success there be no report structure trust endorse qi methodology and the excellence lead report that neither their organisational culture nor their leader be open to change or improvement a a result staff do not feel empower to use their voice identify new idea or engage with the programme in place vignette in case study interview with organisational excellence lead from acute provider participant be ask to describe how qi be use in their organisation and describe barrier or challenge two organisation report experience challenge with their qi programme we have a continuous qi programme in place but we really struggle we ve try to give team the tool to implement change and own it but we have leadership and management that don t support continuous improvement and aren t open to it so people don t feel enable to make change themselves and wait for others to come in and do it our leader expect others to fix their own problem without engage them we need to do good engaging and involve our nurse and midwife we have a poor leadership culture around this and it s a barrier to activity organisational excellence lead the organisation have be stagnant and not try to improve and the qi programme have struggle although we have a qi team the organisation hasn t invest in a specific qi model or the resource so we don t have the capability internally for improvement work leader haven t engage with any direct care staff about this organisational excellence lead these two example depict broad challenge within leadership and organisational culture in relation to the delivery of qi work whilst the com b model be use to analyse and synthesise case azjen s theory of planned behaviour be apply to interpret the divergent case this theory establish that an individual s intention to engage in a behaviour determine whether they will engage in the behaviour their intention be influence by personal attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioural control personal attitude include perception and assumption subjective norm include how the attitude of others be perceive perceived behavioural final version december page of control be the extent they believe they control their own behaviour shape by internal and external factor in the two divergent case although qi programme be in place nurse and midwife do not feel empower to engage or contribute through the theory of plan behaviour when nurse and midwife do not feel empower to voice idea perceive their leader do not welcome change and perceive a low level of control they would not have the intention to engage with excellence a a behaviour even if programme be available these two case highlight the crucial role of positive organisational culture and leadership to determine the success of excellence programme after implementation key point from case study of acute organisation the following be a summary of key point to create condition for change where behaviour that drive excellence can grow and be sustain a part of positive organisational culture where organisation identify success they have the following professional leadership that role model positive attitude to change fostered meaningful recognition and invest in building capability and provide opportunity for continuous improvement an organisational culture that be open to learn and change focus on continuous improvement psychologically safe work environment where staff felt comfortable speak up and change practice engagement and buy in from nurse and midwife at all level from direct care staff to the cno and senior leader conclusion from case study of acute organisation the six pillar of excellence be reflect in the organisation take part in the case study interview they demonstrate how the six pillar drive capability opportunity and motivation to impact behaviour key condition for change be professional leadership and organisational culture that be open to change with a focus on continuous improvement building capability opportunity and motivation result in behaviour for sustainable improvement in culture to embed and drive excellence final version december page of interview with non acute organisation work package the interview include participant from three non acute provider organisation in the midland region all of which be hospice summary of finding the individual pillar of excellence the following be a summary of finding from the six individual pillar of excellence a report by non acute organisation three response be receive all from hospice pillar share professional decision make spdm leader in the hospice see great value in implement the principle of share professional decision make although two hospice do not have spdm council they adopt the principle and ethos of spdm in one hospice the concept of spdm be interpret a a way of help patient to make informed decision pillar local accreditation none of the hospice have guidance in place to deliver local accreditation and two respondent be not aware of local accreditation pillar meaningful recognition one hospice use meaningful recognition and describe this a a focus on building staff resilience through huddle reflective practice to recognise retain and support them two hospice have indefinable approach for meaningful recognition of their staff staff felt their contribution to patient care be relatively insignificant for example the hospice staff feel leave behind acute trust due to the nature of the work e g they felt this be save life compare to end of life care promote recognition require leadership to communicate and reinforce staff value leader state that let staff know they re as important a staff work in the acute setting and they be value and allow staff to tweak a system that work in the acute setting by identify and transfer core concept empower them to help build the framework and initiative need themselves hospice final version december page of pillar continuous quality improvement qi overall each hospice lack a robust model and framework for delivery of qi despite this in one hospice continuous qi be achieve by promote the safety culture e g conduct train on human factor incivility and patient safety incident response framework psirf link to nursing and midwifery excellence it be also cite that newly register nurse be reluctant to express their idea regard quality improvement hospice be small charitable organisation which may lack a typical organisational structure result in disparate framework consequently the effort of the lead practice educator lead nurse and individual nurse in hospice to enhance the quality of care may not be document or link into professional forum framework lead to the absence of reportable mechanism pillar distribute leadership the three hospice lead interview state that they follow a hierarchical leadership approach the second hospice state they follow a lead together approach for distributed leadership in this hospice open forum be hold where leader provide opportunity for staff to create leadership tool to generate attitude for change this promote feedback from staff regard new approach to the management of patient care the final hospice focus on building distribute leadership regardless of hierarchy to include targeted training for aspire leader to develop an understanding of leadership style decision making and collaboration with other colleague and service train place be fill through manager nomination to promote shared leadership there be representation of leadership from clinical and non clinical team to promote distributed leadership a a multi professional approach pillar research innovation one hospice state we have be involve in research project with local university we have develop our own innovative programme and tool that have be present at national conference at a second hospice some nurse have complete research train lead to grow enthusiasm from other staff grow research capacity and capability pose a challenge for the development of research in non acute organisation final version december page of analysis the excellence framework the overall analysis and synthesis from the excellence pillar be illustrate use the com b model figure the response from non acute organisation n be derive for behaviour change associate with relevant capability opportunity motivation and interpret a they be perceive to influence behaviour the final element of this figure show the potential anticipated outcome of behavioural change figure com b model illustrate dynamic factor drive excellence in non acute setting capability capability be build by involve staff in build the framework and take their experience and recommendation into consideration all the hospice recognise the need for train across the six pillar of excellence to foster interest and promote enthusiasm among staff opportunity collaborate with and learn from subject matter expert in other organisation be essential for provide staff with the exposure need to understand the framework and system employ by different organisation this exposure allow staff to adapt best practice in their own organisation lead to improve efficiency and effectiveness in their work final version december page of motivation staff be particularly motivate and inspire when they receive encouragement and support from their leader who role model excellence behaviour leader empower staff to take self initiative aim at achieve excellence in their work and drive improvement within the organisation be key element when staff be provide with appropriate training and resource they recognise the need for change and improvement and be more likely to take proactive step to bring about positive transformation staff be motivate through various method such a acknowledge and validate their contribution additionally incorporate patient experience and feedback into the workplace can also serve a an effective motivational tool the factor describe above serve to cultivate capability opportunity and motivation propel excellence a the behavioural outcome finding finding describe here present a summary from key question ask at interview with non acute organisation regard current excellence measure transferability and timeframes leader state that they be align and actively involve in all measure of excellence and they have a clear understanding of excellence leader also demonstrate the benefit of excellence to staff the organisation and patient communicate the importance of provide staff with appropriate resource to deliver high standard of care for patient they state that visibility of leader be create by go into clinical area spending time with different service leader adhere to this ethos take ownership and responsibility for their action to encourage other staff they give example of develop staff through training on continuous quality improvement which promote a safety culture through training on human factor incivility and psirf to improve the patient and family experience use the principle of share professional decision make spdm enables staff participation and decision making with an aim to create a culture of open engagement with all staff regardless of their role or level ensure equal access to contribution for everyone to successfully implement measure for excellence it be essential to involve direct care staff give dedicated time and space to learn and contribute to the development of these measure it be important to provide them with opportunity to share their opinion and understand how these measure be relevant to their role additionally leadership and coach training can allow them to support others feedback session focus group with staff and engagement with change maker can be organise to bring about positive change in local workplace final version december page of while utilise change management theory motivate staff through patient feedback and improve outcome be also essential additional outcome from excellence behaviour if these behavioural change be achieve the overall excellence outcome would include advancement in patient service and improved patient outcome there will be promotion of the nursing and midwifery profession because of motivated and engaged staff lead to a reduction in staff turnover and sickness positive organisational culture will be promote foster a culture of excellence that support growth and success key point from interview with non acute organisation the finding from non acute participate organisation n be limit in their wider application due to lack of respondent non acute organisation face challenge measure the impact of excellence approach like spdm meaningful recognition research and innovation and continuous quality improvement due to the lack of a framework and dedicated personnel engage expertise and the opportunity to learn from acute setting would assist this process nurse and midwife leader must explore leadership support regard the development of excellence measure and associated staff training required delivery of a nursing and midwifery plan for excellence through the mren will enable staff to participate in the process create a staff network would enable staff to engage in decision making and develop leadership skill especially use the spdm approach develop a framework for each of the excellence pillar and recruit dedicated resource to establish these in non acute setting would help measure the impact of excellence approach and plan necessary improvement conclusion from interview with non acute organisation to implement the six pillar of excellence successfully leader in non acute organisation need great knowledge and awareness of these to drive successful implementation they recognise the importance of these pillar to elicit positive change and improve patient outcome they be however keen to empower their staff to use the pillar effectively by learn from example within acute organisation despite this they have the awareness that they do not have a typical organisational structure process and framework see in large acute organisation to implement the excellence pillars final version december page of metric work package twenty participate

they re speak to about their weight be not helpful they already come with that kind of a an old person i ve be through quite a lot of dread and fear and they fear that we re go to judge conflict with my wife and child and whatever and them so much sometimes female patient come you read the signal and you read it in other people into the room and they re very on the defence and so if i saw you get

how patient lack capacity perceive a benign or inconsequential in they can improve that for me i m always say the another example after initially give little weight to their experience more we report something they re go to have to do involve elderly patient with dementia who give you a rap on the something about it because if we don t report it it s not knuckle p physiotherapist team service

critical patient in the emergency room design from a total of attend physician in the emergency department physician have be train in the share communication course an observation form design base on the share training be complete by two observer who note the communication process between physician and patient and family member during patient notification and sign a dnr order to assess the

member set level trauma medical center in southern taiwan result there be individual enrol in the study of which sign the dnr order and do not sign it analysis from match pair from this population reveal that significantly more family member would sign a dnr order if the physician have be train in the share communication course than when they do not receive this training v respectively p the overall score of the observation form for physician be higher in those individual who have sign a dnr order than in those who do not sign it v respectively p especially when the physician have choose a quiet environment v respectively p understand the patient s wish and confirm them v respectively p and expressed concern v respectively p in addition a feedback survey about the feeling experience by these physician during the process of patient notification do not reveal a significant difference during the communication with those who have or have not sign dnr order conclusion the training in

march executive summary introduction the professional nurse advocate pna programme be a clinical and professional leadership programme deliver by high education institution hei which equip nurse with the skill to deliver restorative clinical supervision to colleague in england the programme have be gradually roll out across england during with the aim of ensure there will be pnas in place to support colleague in the following specialty critical care mental health adult acute child and young people inpatient setting community learn disability adult child and young people safeguard health criminal justice setting hcj and international nurse in february nhse seek an evaluation of the pna programme a research team from coventry university be commission to undertake this work this executive summary report set out the method activity finding and recommendation a request by commissioner background launch towards the end of the third wave of the covid pandemic the pna programme be introduce at the start of a critical point for recovery in the nh whilst the pandemic have add complexity to care delivery and stretch the capacity of the nursing workforce the pna programme provide an opportunity to re build resilience within the profession and promote workforce retention the a equip advocating for education and quality and improvement model with restorative clinical supervision career conversation be integral to pna training and start as soon a their time on the programme begin the hei education programme equip pnas to listen and to understand challenge and demand of fellow colleague lead support and deliver quality improvement initiative in response course content focus first and foremost on restorative supervision practice beyond this the focus be on the four function of the a equip model these four function be a follow clinical supervision restorative monitoring evaluation and quality control normative personal action for quality improvement and education and development formative evaluation aim and objectives the evaluation aim be to explore the impact of the professional nurse advocate pna programme on pnas and wider team with recommendation for improvement the following objective be agree by commissioner create a logic model programme theory of change to explain programme implementation activity rapid review of the pna literature a this relate to empowerment evaluate baseline data across organisation participate in the pna programme assess factor impact on the delivery of the pna programme describe individual perception of pnas and influence contextual factor describe individual perception of nurse receive restorative supervision assess the usefulness of the model and establish assumption essential to delivery evaluate the perceived benefit of restorative supervision plus enablers and barrier provide recommendation on how the programme can be effectively embed implement and sustain across a range of contexts evaluation design a mixed method design be implement with four work package the evaluation be theory drive throughout and we apply the concept of empowerment via laschinger et al model and a theory of programme change logic model laschinger s model enable the development of study question survey design and structure the qualitative phase of the study include analysis enable exploration of structural and psychological empowerment in the workplace and the indicator of positive work feeling fig the logic model be use to map the inputs activity and output of the national programme with our clearly state assumption to guide our question figure laschinger s empowerment model structural psychological positive work empowerment empowerment feeling job opportunity mean satisfaction information confidence commitment support autonomy trust resource impact low burnout formal power informal power data collection method quantitative and qualitative data be collect via a survey case study semi structure interview and a final workshop with commissioner a rapid review of the available literature be use to inform our understanding of the topic and contribute to formation of question alongside the laschinger s empowerment model a survey be design to explore the impact on perception and level of empowerment with all pnas and nurse who have deliver or receive restorative clinical supervision case study organisation in different setting provide the opportunity to undertake a deep dive of pertinent information at individual site area semi structure interview single and joint be complete with the following staff group high education institute lead for the pna course hei regional lead pnas site lead pnas nurse in pna role pnas and nurse who have receive restorative clinical supervision rcs nurse we adopt a sampling approach to achieve maximum variation so that we be able to access a wide range of view and perspectives we include staff work in district general hospital community trust large acute trust and mental health trust and many speciality area findings survey an electronic survey be distribute by nhs england between august and december via email to three constituent group nurse who receive rcs know a rcs nurse pnas and trust pna lead there be response to the survey rcs nurse n pnas n trust lead n most respondent work in adult nursing be female and mainly identify a white rcs nurse respondent be more ethnically diverse than pnas and trust lead trust lead and pnas tend to be qualify for long and be more likely to have be educate in the uk than rcs nurse of the pna respondent have deliver rcs and have yet to do so overall rcs be rat very positively in term of enhance structural empowerment psychological empowerment and positive work feeling these item be all rat at a median of moderately agree by all three group illustrate strong belief in the effectiveness of rcs in have a positive impact on these aspect all group provide a median rating of strongly agree to the statement i believe that restorative supervision be effective illustrate strong support for the effectiveness of rcs the ability of rcs to improve the support available to nurse at work and nurse confidence be rat a a median of strongly agree by all three group open text comment highlight the importance of adequate time provision to undertake the role and to secure staff release for rcs a safe private space in a calm area to create a relaxed environment for the planned rcs session be overwhelmingly identify a a pre requisite factor in which to discuss confidential matter most rcs nurse be fundamentally satisfy with their experience of rcs which leave them feel positive and look forward to continue the process one example of this relate to be challenge matter relate to work be open up that could either hinder or push me to improve but they do push me to improve the way i approach work it seem there be a grow appreciation of the benefit of rcs rcs be describe a a reflective process that legitimise the time and the necessity for nurse to understand and process difficult experience in their role this could only be do with the support and underpinning of a trusting relationship participate in rcs be describe a a positive and constructive experience by many rcs nurse which have boost their self confidence leave them restore and reinvigorate case study be conduct with eight site span healthcare and hei setting across england to provide in depth contextually base information regard the implementation of the professional nurse advocate programme for most heis the pna training module be establish at great speed in the context of the covid pandemic aid through experienced teaching staff amidst a great sense of urgency the case study reveal that a personal commitment to implement the pna programme be important but in the early wave a lack of communication hamper initial strategic effort for example nurse undertake the course in the early day often self select and return to organisation without a strategic lead in place to then implement the programme in late wave this become less common learning be facilitate online use microsoft team or zoom via a level master module require attendance one day per week over approximately week however it be note that there be little parity regard module content or assessment strategy across the many heis deliver the programme in the initial stage this create some frustration and barrier to access for train amongst some pnas due to inadequate entry credential at the appropriate level to enable this study at level this be rectify in late course iteration a general appreciation be reflect that the pna programme have open opportunity for nurse at any stage of their career to engage in further study and to combine this with experience which serve to make nurse feel value and empower in their role for the most part qi activity focus on deliver the restorative aspect of the pna role we ask participant about their understanding of rcs delivery output regard the frequency and type of session offer some participant describe the workforce return and count activity but at the same time not be sure what count a rcs respondent in the case study identify key aspect which enable more effective joint work to achieve programme role out for example they operate a plan and strategic roll out with careful selection of nurse to complete the pna training exist forum be use to drive the progress of the pna work the pna role be link with others in similar domain e g practice educator speak up guardian psychological first aiders pnas be give adequate time to functionalise this aspect of their role a wide interpretation of the pna role be adopt and link with exist clinical supervision mechanism pnas be enable through cpd and this be facilitate through personal development plan pnas be support to do their role through wellbeing mechanism pna lead be link effectively to support via the nhs england pna office all these element enable pns lead to celebrate achievement and generate a sense of sustainability that this be not a project it be here to stay interview data be collect from individual with individual interview and two person interview this include regional pna lead trust pna lead pnas and rcs nurse and hei lead individual be recruit from a range of specialty such a the criminal justice system primary care and the ambulance service from a range of age year male n and female n and those who complete pna training via different course provider range from the first cohort to complete the course to the most recent cohort in total n different course provider it be evident that when the pna programme be implement clinical supervision be see a a new thing for nurse the idea of nurse to nurse support be value but have not really be experience before for many respondent clear difference be identify between clinical supervision and restorative supervision nurse who have experience rcs want the process to be normalize and more mainstream a there be still some concern about the negative connotation associate with supervision follow up after initial rcs be see a important but there be barrier to this occurring time and be free from the duty be the chief issue nurse who have complete the pna course praise the content and experience of the study for this qualification online learning be the core approach due to covid restriction and whilst many benefit be identify e g no travel some respondent felt more practical experience and assessment of their skill be need however there be challenge in implement what have be promote during the programme within the workplace context this be largely relate to short staffing and a lack of space and time to undertake rcs most pna respondent be very clear on the benefit of rcs in restore supporting and enabling nurse and in some case enable nurse to stay in the profession feeling value support and listen to be the over rid perspective there appear to be confusion about data collection and rcs a many respondent do not report their data to a lead pna the process of receive restorative clinical supervision and career conversation require more clarity to understand if when and how progress be be make throughout the process for example some nurse indicate their first time experience of rcs be surround with uncertainty especially if they be ask to attend supervision with little explanation beforehand this leave some nurse describe their offloading of issue rather than be active participant in a process lead towards great resilience we have suggest that this be an area for further research conclusion the support of experienced nurse pnas in practice help nurse feel value and empower in some case rcs and career conversation be enable nurse who might otherwise leave the profession to stay the programme have open opportunity for nurse to engage in further study and development follow the programme these factor be important in the context of a global workforce retention crisis the a equip model can be accomplish through good nursing leadership at site level to assist the implementation of the model with pnas support this role out the intention to implement require a solid commitment and not contingent on the perfect condition the prerequisite condition must be consider and well think out during implementation to include time for rcs and pnas to carry out the role private space to conduct the rcs session and good communication regard the plan to involve the key people finally despite some of the issue identify the creation of a pna movement through the development of the national programme have create much need support for nurse and be the transformative element of nurse empowerment and great satisfaction at work recommendation prior to the pna programme the delivery of restorative support and clinical supervision for nurse be not well develop despite some pocket of good practice learn from the area good practice develop through the programme must be adopt across england regional and site lead pnas require more time to drive the pna programme strategy juggle many other priority which create challenge for implementation at site level there be much learning that could be share across each wave of roll out to avoid replication in the development of work and the energy need to deliver the programme disparity in the pna programme assessment strategy across heis and the requirement for work base learn in current nh pressure require an agreement for parity for of assessment at level adequate time release of nurse and access to office space privacy be need for pnas to facilitate rcs and career conversation these element at site level be critical to sustain the programme delivery more work be need to develop and promote all element of the a equip model in practice particularly quantifiable improvement in patient care arise from qi work far understanding regard if how progress be enable through the rcs model be need this we suggest be an important area for further research to clearly articulate the benefit to the individual and team over time introduction the professional nurse advocate pna programme be a clinical and professional leadership programme deliver by high education institution hei which equip nurse with the skill to deliver restorative clinical supervision to colleague across england the programme have be gradually roll out across england during with the aim of ensure there will be pnas in place to support colleague in the following specialty critical care mental health adult acute child and young people inpatient setting community learn disability adult child and young people safeguard health criminal justice setting hcj international nurse the professional nurse advocate pna be a leadership and advocacy role design to support nurse to deliver safe and effective practice a key aspect of this model be to teach nurse to deliver restorative clinical supervision in their area of practice the implementation of this program across nurse aim to support delivery of the long term plan for the nh and enable

attract retain and celebrate nurse pna train provide those on the programme with skill to facilitate restorative supervision to their colleague and team in nursing and beyond a version of this programme exist already for maternity colleague where outcomes point to improve staff wellbeing and retention alongside improve patient outcome restorative supervision be first introduce in the health visit workforce in the uk at a time of fragile professional identity wallbank throughout the literature it be describe broadly a a safe space to express professional anxiety and share new idea to improve role and cop in the workplace the restorative supervision process acknowledge personal emotion and help staff to work through containment strategy to restore their thinking in practice situation the restorative supervision that pnas deliver be integral to their training and start as soon a their time on the programme begin the training equip them to listen and to understand challenge and demand of fellow colleague and to lead support and deliver quality improvement initiative in response the course content of pna training focus first and foremost on restorative supervision beyond this the focus be on the four function of the advocating for education and quality and improvement a equip model these four function be a follow clinical supervision restorative monitoring evaluation and quality control normative personal action for quality improvement education and development formative benefit of the a equip model include provide a framework for the consistent delivery of effective and psychological safe clinical supervision deliver professional development at level master level with recognised national qualification in leadership and advocacy

work this report set out the method activity finding and recommendation a request by commissioner background the pna programme launch in march towards the end of the third wave of covid this be the start of a critical point for recovery in the nh for patient for service and for the nursing workforce the covid pandemic add complexity to care delivery through new way of work and by stretch the capacity of the nursing workforce the pna programme provide an opportunity to re build resilience and promote retention through adequate support in the form of the a equip model the evaluation specify

between structural empowerment and psychological empowerment support kanter s claim that social structural factor in the workplace be important condition for empower employee to accomplish their work laschinger et al p empowerment theory be imperative for this evaluation to enable understanding of if how the pna programme with it information resource through the a equip model support pnas

bottom line evidence five paper shape the finding relate to empowerment with pnas and rcs nurse empowerment be an extensive term in this review it broadly relate to knowledge gain from the pna programme and enablement of support strategy and learn through a equip model with rcs nurse laschinger s model encompass structural psychological and positive work feeling laschinger state psychological empowerment be define a the psychological state that employee must experience for empowerment intervention to be successful laschinger et al p it be posit that empowerment be experience through the pna programme and a equip model thereafter the model create the opportunity for a relationship between pnas to form and to promote empowerment of nurse receive rcs through the delivery of restorative interaction factor contribute to structural empowerment arise from supportive mechanism teach on the pna programme and take the opportunity for rcs have enough time be an important factor relate to individual empowerment experience and the delivery of restorative clinical supervision and be refer to throughout hence although not explicit it would be disempowering if time be not available encourage positive work feeling be report a feeling motivate by pnas and the rcs process and be able to help others in a reciprocal relationship which involve the whole team the presence of a model for clinical supervision be empower and make nurse feel value supervisory relationship on an individual level create a sense of person centeredness and be listen to moreover this process may help to empower nurse to remain in practice psychological empowerment be report a raise self awareness to regulate less positive learnt nurse behaviour and encourage more positive interaction although the pna programme and empowerment be not report in sufficient detail to draw conclusion empowerment be a feature n refer to individually and structurally a a positive influence upon well be notable by it absence be any reporting relate to empowerment a it relate to improve patient care by nurse muscat et al mahati foster griffith and pearce conclusion this review be limit to the experiential and anecdotal publish evidence available which indicate that rcs deliver through the pna programme should be able to decrease stress and burnout empowerment arises from rcs to support nurse time to contemplate different perspective of issue and help inform their onward decision make these result be found through discussion reflective conversation supportive challenge and open and honest feedback empowerment can be express a a improved knowledge of collective leadership and the power of be involve in quality improvement have give them a good understanding and appreciation of the pna role with it many benefit while the quality of evidence be weak it provide justification for evaluate the impact of the programme and the potential for empowerment a a derivative the survey introduction this section describe the method and finding of the online survey the survey be design to address key aspect of the evaluation requirement document it aim to evaluate key stakeholder perception of restorative clinical supervision rcs and their perceived effectiveness in meet their publish role and responsibility method an electronic survey be develop and distribute via joint information system committee jisc online survey appendix page an introductory email which include a link to the electronic survey be distribute by nhs england via email to three constituent group i nurse who receive rcs ii pnas iii trust pna lead for the purpose of brevity these group will be refer to a rcs nurse pnas and trust lead throughout the remainder of this chapter study information a privacy notice and explicit informed consent be integrate into the survey participant be unable to progress to the main survey without confirm their consent there be an initial under representation of rcs nurse respond to the survey so an amendment to ethical approval be secure to ask pnas to advertise the survey to rcs nurse that they have supervise the survey be also advertise during an online event host by nhs england these step be successful in secure more response from rcs st th nurse the survey open on august and close on december a copy of the survey be available in appendix x the survey be develop and amend in collaboration with member of the evaluation team and the nhs england nhse team who commission the evaluation and it be thoroughly pilot before be launch the main section of the survey be a follow about you basic demographic information be collect to provide context to the analysis this include the region of england and field of nursing in which respondent work age gender ethnicity and disability and time since completion of their nurse education and whether their nurse education be conduct outside of the united kingdom uk answer to all question be require although all have prefer not to say and other option where appropriate about rcs answer to all question in this section be compulsory question be construct to address the different component of the model of empowerment by laschinger et al laschinger et al s model be the key framework select for the wider evaluation and be use a the basis for understand the effectiveness of rcs the model contain a total of item arrange in domain and be summarise in figure page a positively worded statement relate to each of the item be construct and respondent be ask to state their level of agreement with each of the statement on a item likert scale range from strongly agree to strongly disagree this section be preface with a definition and explanation of rcs a describe by nhs england nh innovation an additional five statement be add to this section in response to suggestion from the research and nhse i team during development and pilot these address the effectiveness of rcs in help to improve the safety of patient care delivery the ability to make change to care delivery network with others the influence nurse have in their practice and the leadership of quality improvement answer to all question be require a second section about rcs be present at the end of the survey this ask respondent to indicate their level of agreement with the statement i believe that restorative clinical supervision be effective use the same item likert scale a before this provide an overall rating of the effectiveness of rcs finally respondent be ask to indicate the main benefit of rcs what could be improve about rcs and how those improvement could be implement use open text response again answer be require to all question although response could be brief perceived effectiveness in meet role responsibilities the question in this section be base on the publish role and responsibility relevant to each of the three group rcs nurse pnas and trust lead statement relate to the respondent s perceive effectiveness in meet each of their publish role and responsibility critical care network national nurse lead be create respondent be then ask to state their level of agreement with each statement use the same item likert scale a before all question in this section be compulsory additional evaluation the final section provide an optional open text box for any other comment that respondent want to add and an opportunity to leave their contact detail if they be happy to be contact by the evaluation team to discuss the pna programme in more detail data analysis demographic data be analyse and report a total number and proportion for each group likert scale item be convert to number for the purpose of analysis a follow strongly agree moderately agree slightly agree slightly disagree moderately disagree strongly disagree these be treat a ordinal scale data for the purpose of analysis and median interquartile range iqr be use to summarise response for each of the group open text response be analyse from rcs nurse pnas and trust pna lead who respond to the evaluation survey provide their insight regard the benefit improvement and how the improvement identify for the rcs process could be implement most data comprise very short response of several word data be extract into a microsoft word document and through reading familiarise each response be open cod and a list of characteristic for each make to form description and cod book far reading of whole content across all response from each question and participant group compare between rcs nurse pna and trust pna lead s data enable identification of connection and divergence between characteristic synthesis be guide accord to the emergent characteristic to form overarch theme this analytical process be use to keep an open mind regard the possibility particularly in relation to the development of potential adaptation to the a equip model delivery or enrich the empowerment theory a this relate to the pna programme three central theme be identify a condition necessary for rcs nurse participation engagement and organisational commitment to rcs in the a equip model and reflection on and reinvigoration from rcs a such they represent three phase of delivery namely before during and afterwards result about you there be response to the survey rcs nurse n pnas n trust lead n the demographic of respondent in each group be detail in table there be a fairly even representation from the different english region and most respondent work in adult nursing there be a great proportion of rcs nurse in the young age category compare to pnas and trust lead although the proportion in the year of age category be similar across all three group the sample be predominantly female and mainly identify a white ethnicity rcs nurse respondent be more ethnically diverse than pnas and trust lead the proportion declare a disability be similar across the three group trust lead and pnas tend to be qualify for long and be more likely to have be educate in the uk than rcs nurse indeed none of the trust lead report that they have receive their nurse education outside of the uk survey item rcs pnas trust nurse n lead n n in which of east of

the open end question in the survey each have three interconnect characteristic most identify by rcs nurse pnas and trust lead theme condition necessary for rcs theme nurse participation engagement organisational commitment to rcs in the a equip model theme reflection and reinvigoration from rcs theme condition necessary for rcs this theme comprise of three characteristic namely adequate time provision a safe space and adequate communication three perspective of safe space relate to the provision of office use microsoft team and engage in group supervision the density of response throughout each be focussed on time and a provision of a safe space adequate time most rcs nurse respondent indicate they be give adequate time to participate in rcs this be describe a have time or be give time many rcs response this meant that the process of establish a time for rcs whilst on duty have be successfully facilitate by the ward manager and pnas for some rcs nurse frustration be express regard not have time allocate and not be release from their clinical shift or duty or with adequate cover provide to allow them to leave the clinical area rostered time to participate in rcs need adequate cover together with this need identify protected time many rcs response be a frequently cite once in rcs session on occasion the time allocate be not sufficient to enable issue to be explore or conducive to the topic be discuss be release from duty to participate be not reflective of all response and seem contingent on the model use e g ad hoc session schedule session and regularly schedule session hence most satisfaction be express where rcs be a regular activity and date be in place for future session rcs nurse some rcs nurse recommend an increase in pna provision be need although this be not generalise across the data that increase pna capacity be need to deliver enough rcs session and would enable nurse to book a when need rcs nurse one rcs nurse express that with so few pnas on one site this deliver rcs might overload and add stress for pnas rcs nurse nevertheless emotional labour be not a feature describe by pnas it seem that the system for identify nurse or enable nurse to book rcs in some area require further refinement in contrast to rcs nurse relatively few pnas felt they be satisfy with have enough time to deliver rcs different perspective of time be describe by pnas regard contingent condition such a pressure of day job and unmanageable compete priority alongside their clinical role time to undertake this role as currently pna role be secondary to my main clinical role and trust hospital still have not allocate any time identify to undertake role unless in own time pna and this situation be similarly reflect by pna site lead rcs can t be do when overwhelm with current workload cover sickness or shortage of staff on other ward pna lead satisfaction be express by pnas regard be able to support career development pna and for be able to carry out structured planning to address issue raise through rcs session pna in relation to the a equip model have enough time be a hugely important factor in relation to the delivery of the pna model and one of the key condition identify this be epitomise by some pnas who felt without adequate time they be lose their skill and confidence to deliver rcs this situation be also familiar to site lead many pnas be not use valuable knowledge and skill acquire through their training to support colleague we will lose our pna skill furthermore pnas be always in the number like other clinician because their role be not formally recognize pna lead pnas be very keen to deliver a service for their nurse through the a equip model they be enjoy the role of be a pna but this be outweigh by the significant volume of response which indicate issue in the delivery of the model some issue relate to have protect and recognise time or freeing of time for example be give the time and space to do the supervision i no longer do it because my trust doesn t give me any time and have do it in my own time for a year i refuse to do so any long pna pnas be concern that they could not always deliver the service and balance this with their current work demand staff be keen to access the service but it be not always possible due to my work commitment and demand with patient so staff need time to be able to access the rcs and we need more time to deliver this pna a safe space a private space in a calm area to create a relaxed environment for the planned rcs session be overwhelmingly identify a a pre requisite factor this enabled nurse to speak openly during the rcs session and for most this be express a a very positive experience many rcs nurse the nurse s privacy and confidentiality be articulate a be paramount to engagement in the rcs process rcs nurse on occasion for some rcs be interrupt through pager or other staff need the office space rcs nurse which make the circumstance unsuitable and leave some nurse feel vulnerable and reluctant to participate rcs nurse hence a safe space be not always guarantee and depend on the availability of room often on the day confidentiality and trust be raise a important benefit of rcs and relate to safe space be able to speak to someone who be not necessarily in a line manager position and have confidence in the confidentiality of the conversation rcs nurse several nurse suggest rcs should always be deliver by pnas that be not familiar to themselves several rcs response to ensure authenticity and confidentiality again this associate the need to feel safe in the safe space nevertheless other rcs nurse describe be familiar with pnas from their ward team and the issue regard familiarity be not cite the solution be possibly to have the choice of pna regardless of the where they be base and this require organisation and communication in advance of rcs session while use microsoft team and other digital platform be necessary to enable participation during the covid pandemic this do not suit some rcs nurse preference for face to face session be express by several nurse who have experience rcs via microsoft team state this be not conducive to feel real and purposeful rcs nurse assumption be make by some pnas regard rcs nurse s access to personal computer or work office or privacy if work remotely consequently inadequate access to computer and lack of privacy diminish find a safe space and undermined delivery of some rcs session use microsoft team for rcs need careful consideration to take account of these factor some rcs nurse indicate that group supervision be favour which be describe a provide a structured opportunity to share idea and make suggestion several rcs nurse rcs nurse enjoy be with other nurse colleague in a similar position and listen to others be a process of realisation one nurse state that thing that have bother me and i hadn t look at them be able to be examine by others with similar experience rcs nurse the ideal group situation be describe a where mutual feeling can be express in a safe environment rcs nurse group reflection be sometimes structure through clinical and management scenario from practice where the discussion unpack a different perspective help to see what other colleague would have do differently or what i saw differently in the scenario and sometimes think about this afterwards rcs nurse once again safe space be cite but this time a need a safe open space establish with trusted ground rule rcs nurse skilled facilitation and trust be a critical success factor for group supervision find a safe space be mention relatively little by pnas it seem to be a minor irritation for some and particularly where space can not be book in advance pna a safe space be present a beneficial in the context of it purpose to constructively use time safe convenient space conducive for staff rcs to explore their thought and form a plan pna pnas reflect that they appreciate the need for safe space and that this be a pre requisite when arrange rcs session adequate communication regard rcs most rcs nurse be fundamentally satisfy with their experience of rcs which leave them feel positive and look forward to continue the process information be generally disseminate from pnas via email or face to face contact for these rcs nurse they felt very well inform i be tell it rcs be book about three week in advance it be on the e roster and i know it be something different to the usual pop into the office with my manager rcs nurse some rcs nurse however be apprehensive about rcs because there be little or no communication about session consequently these nurse be leave unclear about what rcs entail or what be expect from them during rcs several rcs nurse describe be send for supervision and that use this approach change perspective of rcs from a supportive activity to management suggestion to improve this include be tell in advance and give information use nhs trust communication briefing via the intranet and newsletter to promote the benefit of rcs and the production of information leaflet theme nurse participation engagement organisational commitment to rcs in the a equip model in this theme nurse describe their understanding of participation in restorative clinical supervision how mechanism and structure for this be enact at site level two key characteristic of this theme be identify a grow appreciation of the benefit of rcs and issue with local framework for delivery at site level grow appreciation of the benefit of rcs the a equip model be start to spread throughout healthcare organisation and become recognise by nurse a a structured emotional supportive mechanism through rcs where need nurse be access pna support to resolve practice issue they find difficult to address rcs enables openness in safe space to generate discussion and potential self relate action and others which could improve their practice depend on the level of confidence and experience practice solution could be action by the nurse receive rcs or pna s and lead pnas nurse receive rcs state that the process legitimise access to support especially when need the rcs model be view a a positive benefit to support nurse in clinical practice a rcs nurse explain can help you see thing from a different perspective when discuss the tough issue while another rcs nurse appreciate the challenge for example matter relate to work be open up that could either hinder or push me to improve but they do push me to improve the way i approach work some pnas compare the a equip model to their previous supervision role of year ago and express clear support and understanding stating for the difference state this be different to the traditional formal learning and development of clinical supervision pna the pnas suggest their role be focussed on constructive behaviour and a restorative approach for nurse who be experience significant emotional demand the a equip model have make lead pnas and pnas more aware of the need to take time to consider the wellbeing of staff help colleague to have good work life balance help colleague to offload their anxiety enable colleague to feel emotionally restore after and contribute to job satisfaction in the workplace lead pna the pnas report positively throughout regard the benefit of the model and their personal realisation about use the model the response relate to passion for be part of the programme and be able to use their experience in nursing through the rcs process issue regard local framework for delivery at site level this theme be represent by characteristic which relate to be able to make change in their role have enough time feel value and respect take seriously by management and support to implement the model of a equip amongst the response which indicate many improvement be need in local delivery there be much positive feedback from rcs nurse and pnas couple with a sense of need to test out process especially for newcomer rcs nurse indicate that although they be very satisfied with the session they attend make change in practice be an aspect they felt to be lacking and would benefit from be follow up after supervision to give reassurance that for example something will change to make it good rcs nurse some rcs nurse apportion their suggestion to improve matter regard change to managerial level of staff for example manager need to fix thing rcs nurse and similarly some pnas felt manager be not as well engage a they should be manager should be good engage with the process and purpose of rcs pna while the type of manager need to effect change be not indicate a reasonable assumption be of ward manager or matron take ownership and responsibility be part of the rcs process but this be also a learning process and for most rcs be relatively new if rcs be relatively infrequent this increase the anxiety that nothing will change notwithstanding make change happen follow rcs require confidence agency and the authority to act and may need further support from more senior staff in the process to effect change pnas be keen to see the engagement of middle senior and corporate level nurse to improve the strategy for delivery of a equip there be a huge proliferation of response to indicate that although the model be work in some area very many pnas felt unsupported in it implementation we ve be leave to set up the service on our own which wasn t what i sign up for when i do the course pna despite this some lead pnas cite enjoy set up the service and that have dedicate time to do this i don t have much time but i be follow the example of others to set up the service as best a i can i could always do more with more time lead pna some pnas express their frustration about senior management support them and the difficulty in keep a service go at busy time time to attend rcs should be mandate a when it busy it s the first thing to be cancel pna there be many reference to need more visibility of very senior nurse and need to feel that they understand and value the pna and rcs function of their role one person state senior nursing management not take the role seriously they seem to be pay lip service and switch the rcs on and off accord to how busy we be surely if we be busy and pressure be on this be when we need to ensure continuity of the delivery of rcs and investing in the role to support our nurse pna finally some pnas cite not feel value and not respect for what they do by the trust management this be illustrate by a quote from a pna effective leadership within trust they need to support this and respect u currently undertake in addition to other role with no allocated time pna in summary in case where time be not give to pnas along with the support need to set up and deliver the a equip model pnas felt devalue or overlook by the most senior nurse where they work theme reflection and reinvigoration from rcs the process of rcs legitimise the time and necessity for nurse to be enable to reflect and understand difficult perspective in their role it seem this process gradually change think about individual work base issue or those which be affect by team member or personal matter this be a rewarding activity for rcs nurse and pnas many describe rcs a a time to offload or unload issue and this alone help them to feel relieve to key characteristic of this theme be the reflective process need and the reinvigoration possible a reflective process some rcs nurse describe be less able to instantaneously offload issue and needing time to reflect on the process of rcs to prepare them for the next time others indicate they be learn about what rcs entail and how to make it beneficial to them and their practice afterwards the development of trust be also a prerequisite to authenticity in the rcs process to really benefit from rcs i need to have confidence that the person i be share thing with be go to keep my confidence rcs nurse be able to begin reflection a part of rcs however be contingent on have a safe space which enable open conversation and issue to be explore hence rcs can not be assume to be an instant hit engagement in the process be contingent on satisfaction regard the necessary condition underpin by a trusting relationship rcs be a reinvigorate experience participate in rcs be describe a a positive and constructive experience by very many rcs nurse and be where the density of response be concentrate these respondent express that no change be need to rcs and that they be very happy or want more rcs nurse describe their experience a facilitate structured conversation with debriefs towards solution none of the respondent provide negative feedback about their rcs experience for a very small minority they identify it be not for them and that it be what it be and some respondent be unsure about the process express that they have only have limit access to rcs or they will see how they feel next time rcs nurse enthusiastically describe how rcs have encourage them to think differently about problem this boost their self confidence during and have an impact after session leave them to feel more restored final remark provide by rcs nurse offer a proliferation of positive feedback regard pnas support knowledge and experience the following example be provide a representative of the feeling express my pna be base in they be someone i know and trust deeply they make me feel value and empower to change thing i have control of and to take the positive out of situation where they be not always obvious it rcs have be a fabulous experience so far rcs nurse the leadership perspective to support rcs and pnas stem from the awareness of what of could be achieve when the number of pnas reach the optimum level to deliver rcs there need to be more opportunity for rcs and this can only be address a more pnas be train lead pna discussion many of the characteristic of survey respondent seem to be broadly representative of the wider nursing workforce however it should be note that it be particularly difficult to recruit rcs nurse and alternative recruitment strategy have to be implement to try to access this group this be eventually effective in recruit nurse respondent but it be not know if those respond differ from the wide population of nurse who have receive rcs it be also notable that we recruit considerably few rcs nurse n than pnas n give the focus of the pna programme on support nurse in their role rcs nurse would ideally have be the large cohort recruit the initial gate keep role of nhse in approach potential survey participant may have hinder access to this group a those who initially receive detail of the survey be likely to have be at a more strategic level i e trust lead the information may therefore not have be effectively cascade to pnas to reach rcs nurse indeed evidence from some of the interview conduct a part of the evaluation suggest that survey detail be specifically not disseminate more widely due to factor such a service demand and other ongoing staff survey it be recommend that future evaluation of the pna programme should develop and implement an additional range of recruitment strategy to specifically target nurse receive rcs see appendix page for explanation of recruitment strategy implement in this study nursing and midwifery council membership data nmc have report that of registrant be of white ethnicity be of asian black mixed race or other ethnicity and didn t declare or prefer not to say across all hospital and community service in nhs england of the nursing midwifery and health visitor workforce report be from a white ethnicity bme black and minority ethnic and unknown our data be likely to have be broadly representative of these figure although it be noticeable that ethnic diversity differ across the three group for example of rcs nurse who respond to our survey report be from an asian british asian black african caribbean black british or mixed multiple ethnic group background but this proportion fell to of pnas and just of trust lead this change in ethnic diversity with seniority have be identify previously for example the proportion of nurse midwife and health visitor from a bme background be report to drop from at agenda for change afc band to at band and at band nh england the pna programme team regional lead trust lead and others should reflect carefully on these trend and implement strategy to enhance equality diversity and inclusion regard appointment to pna and trust lead role nmc data report that of registrant report their gender a male which be very comparable to the proportion report in the nurse group in the current survey it be interest that the proportion of male fell to of pnas and of trust lead nmc also report that of registrant be in adult nursing in child s in learn disability and in mental health these proportion be again very comparable to the figure in each of the three sample recruit to our survey the sample be therefore likely to be broadly representative of the wider nursing workforce on the basis of these characteristic in of the nhs workforce be register a have a disability on the electronic staff record the proportion self report a disability on the nhs survey be much high however at nhs england the proportion of respondent report a disability in our survey range from of rcs nurse to of trust lead give the anonymous nature of our survey it might be expect that the report disability rate might be close to that of the nhs survey this may therefore indicate an under representation of respondent with disability in our survey although that can not be verify rcs be generally view very positively by all three group it should be note however that more than of pnas have yet to have experience of deliver rcs and this be reflect in some of the open text comment about not use skill of those who have deliver rcs there be a very wide range of experience although the mean value of rcs nurse supervise suggest good level of experience it should be note that this mean value will include both active and complete supervision so it be not clear from the survey result what the level of ongoing supervision might be the positivity around rcs be evident in term of high median rating for statement relate to the model of empowerment table and for the additional question table respondent be particularly positive regard their overall impression of the effectiveness of rcs with the median rating for this statement at the high level of strongly agree in all three group table only one statement across all aspect of rcs receive a median rating of slightly agree and this be by pnas in relation to opportunity in conclusion however the override impression of rcs be very positive in general all three group be also very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meet their publish role and responsibility table the only exception be rcs nurse completion of the e learn module before their rcs session this be give a median rating of moderately disagree rcs nurse be also slightly less positive median rating of slightly agree about their effectiveness in access a pna and discuss with their line manager the timeframe for rcs session and implementation of the a equip model it be notable that of the statement present to rcs nurse reach a maximum level of agreement of strongly agree meaning that most respondent award this maximum rating for their perceived effectiveness pnas be also very positive about their perceived effectiveness rating of statement at this high level of agreement none be rat low than moderately agree by pnas finally trust lead be also positive about their perceived effectiveness the only item that be rat slightly less positively median rating of slightly agree by trust lead relate to ensure arrangement for all nurse to have access to a pna that pnas have allocate time and that nurse be release to meet their pna these be very important practical and workload relate issue that might require close consideration by the pna programme team regional lead trust lead and others these issue be also very evident in the open text response to the survey overall however the three group be very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meet their role and responsibility conclusion in summary the respondent to the survey be likely to have be broadly representative of the wider nursing workforce although the response rate from rcs nurse receive rcs be sub optimal overall rcs be view very positively by rcs nurse pnas and trust lead the three group be also generally very positive about their perceived effectiveness in meet their publish role and responsibility although further work be require to support rcs nurse to engage with the a equip e learn module prior to rcs rcs nurse be slightly less positive about access a pna and discuss timeframes with their line manager trust lead be also slightly less positive about some of the practical aspect of ensure access of nurse to pnas allocated time for the pna role and release of rcs nurse to meet their pna the case study introduction the perspective of lead person at high education institute hei and lead pnas at nhs setting across eight different geographical area be seek to provide in depth contextually base information regard the implementation of the professional nurse advocate programme this provide a view into individual organisational process and necessary relationship between hei and healthcare setting to establish and recruit to pna programme and to deliver rcs barrier and facilitator be

table example of high education institute delivery of pna programme introduction to the qualitative data finding for most heis the pna training module be establish at great speed aid through experienced teaching staff for example some staff have experience of deliver leadership programme and the professional midwife advocate programme enable them to draw upon this knowledge to support the necessary pace and scale in healthcare setting the covid pandemic reassign many people s role with an appreciation of the need to take care of staff in such ill prepare transition a participant describe the context and the sense of urgency this create when covid happen i realise we need to do something for staff so within the first month of redeploy people i take on a central role set up wellbeing champion to look after the nurse work in collaboration with occupation health and the psychology team to deliver wellbeing support i be approach to understand where pnas could fit into this strategy and that s how it all start lead pna nh for others there be an appreciation of need to establish if where and how the pna programme fit into exist organisational support such a coaching and leadership work this meant understand if the programme would plug perceived gap in support and how best to engage staff with the idea for example i have a member of staff who come forward to test the programme they be in a leadership role but it be not until they have do the programme that we saw the uniqueness of it you know it s not the same a a qi course or management it s the equip element that provide the difference and strong framework hei healthcare organisation initially rely upon speak to pnas to understand their impression of the role this process cascade enthusiasm from early adopter of the programme towards the successful national roll out despite issue encounter three core theme span the qualitative data namely a personal commitment to implement the pna programme pna module characteristic and programme evolution and output a personal commitment to implement the pna programme the hei lead and lead pnas describe their role regard liaison with each other and the regional lead in case where heis work across multiple healthcare organisation this create vast administration responsibility to ensure communication be timely and smooth for the enrolment of student although clear frustration be sometimes express regard communication early adopter network to share experience and tip frustration regard the huge scale and pace of roll out create a sense of not be able to keep track of thing adequately a illuminate there be no one single point of communication which create problem for the university and communication back to the healthcare organisation especially regard starter or those who seem to have drop off the radar it be a mess initially hei supportive structure process and relationship to aid the implementation of the programme be emerge in healthcare organisation and be replicate across england through share learning network a see in this example since we start compare to where we be now we do have the regional lead and i would say different regional lead seem to be more engaged than others with regard to be able to be our representative i will say i m concerned student x isn t attend you know and they re kind of like oh no they should be come or i ll speak to their line manager that kind of level of interaction hei lead pnas also express that there have be a steep learning curve where they have rely heavily on key member of senior nursing staff to develop their knowledge about how to organise and manage the roll out in healthcare setting in some area there be issue regard the appropriate selection of candidate for the programme but pnas share their insight regard how to progress at pace while keep staff engage three example demonstrate experience the difference and learn between early and a late wave of implementation an early wave participant the pnas be train and then tell to go back to their organisation and implement the programme they be practice development nurse who do not have the agency in their role they be look to me to provide the structure to say how to do it we be still create that structure nhs an early wave participant initially it be just self selection staff put themselves forward and that be due to the short turn around for enrolment literally we say by pm now we be get more oversight and support be need from line manager we do pause all training at one point due to operational problem and inadequate information to participant regard expectation from the training nhs a late wave participant i review all the application to make sure each person be allocate a buddy a they go onto a training place we be look at the spread of pnas across the organisation nowadays much more than at first when we accept any application or nomination a i lead i be also make sure i let them do their own stuff let them get on with what work for them their team we be still relatively early day but it feel like the right road lead pna nhs throughout each interview participant share their enthusiasm for the programme and the need to legitimise support for staff action learning and problem solve to forge forward summarise the situation pna module characteristic gradual evolution the impression we gain be that heis need to respond and react quickly to establish module use a best fit approach e g to select an exist module and adapt this to the topic of restorative supervision the essence of training be to support leadership in the workplace module be all fix at level master require attendance one day per week and usually deliver over week student be expect to participate in all the core lecture and the activity the pna programme begin during the covid pandemic for this reason most of the training during this period be deliver digitally via microsoft team with enrolment and the content access via electronic portal we have hear for some pnas access training prove problematic owing to unfamiliarity with such process the delivery of training be gradually change throughout the new wave of implementation and although most remains online the use of webinars development of small community of practice and networking of pnas who have complete training to support others across region be now commonplace interviewee describe in depth get to grip with their student need and be responsive to feedback in some case take time to visit healthcare organisation to gain an understanding of the issue for some this result in make change to the module a described i find that by listen to need of the nurse we be able to actually free up some of the curriculum or some of the taught content to actually have a little bit more space in it to be a bit more creative which again for me be quite exciting really to be able to do that heip to date there be no parity regard module content or assessment across the many heis deliver the programme this have create some frustration and barrier to access for train amongst some pnas barrier to access relate to a lack of adequate entry credential at the appropriate level to enable this study at level previous experience gain in professional role and cpd have sometimes negate academic entry problem but these be judge on a case by case basis this situation be best illustrate by the following observation a lot of u be unconvinced of the need for the module to be master s level it be come from the academic nurse background but that feel the reality of the workforce nowadays not everyone have this ability at this level but they do have the capability value experience and skill to be a pna we have a very experienced old workforce it be put people off and failure be counterproductive nh the characteristic of level module and subsequent assessment be different in their delivery accord to the hei the content of the module must be quality assure and must deliver adequate academic work to be award accreditation consequently we hear the academic credit award for the module range from to and the type of assessment to be complete varied it seem that most issue describe by participant reflect problem encounter by pna trainee regard be able to write at level and for some this translate a need more support than be available to them improve communication be also an identified need in some area to help pnas prepare for academic readiness to study and the academic process require to become a student in some case these issue remain challenge as describe there be challenge with the course i really don t know if this be the way to go for this qualification there be the academic side of this but the pna role really lend itself to people who be compassionate be commit to wellbeing and these aspect don t always align and that s ok but put this together in practice make it a problem i have a fantastic nurse she already do clinical supervision but hadn t do any further education her name be put forward but she fail the assignment so it give the wrong message that only the academic part matter nhs share learn from programme be be facilitate through a network meeting and we understand some modification be make from wave to wave for example portfolio and poster presentation first time around now it be a single essay but look at whether this could be change again to help the student it be word level master hei nonetheless we hear on several occasion that there be a desire from some healthcare organisation to work closely with heis bring the course in house for example in the future we would like to co create the training so it be more appealing a work base learning we could then give staff the option and this would feel more inclusive to ensure nurse have equity of access nhs regardless of the content and type of assessment we hear that heis be conscious about the academic workload require for the module and agree that for some nurse new to learn at level or in particularly challenge or busy clinical role or with home life commitment this could pose a barrier to achievement nevertheless the pna role have be designate a a post graduate role require level study a number of the hei participant explain the nature of additional learn support offer such a study skill programme evolution and output output describe be reflective of the stage of implementation and be discuss by hei lead and pna lead in their corresponding role a an iterative process of growth a general appreciation be reflect that the pna programme have open opportunity for nurse at any stage of their career to engage in further study and to combine this with experience participant feel that the combination serve to make nurse feel value and empower in their role the narrative be present that the pna programme have create a movement in just month at point of evaluation with pnas be train and rcs intervention be deliver the benefit of roundtable meeting be highlight in provide a forum to share practice that would otherwise not have be accessible from around the length and breadth of england we be tell about output through the type of quality improvement qi project underway and it be acknowledge that this type of activity could be hard to capture for the most part qi activity focus on deliver the restorative aspect of the pna role one example of qi work be describe a follow we only really get to know about these qi work from practice reflection a some submit most be small scale thing such a a way to change the way equipment be use to improve the safety perspective for staff nh we ask participant about their understanding of rcs delivery output regard the frequency and type of session offer some participant describe the workforce return and count activity but at the same time not be sure what count a rcs this be illustrate from the remark of one participant we be work on this we have move from a position of nurse not want to take it rcs up because they felt guilty about take the time when ward be so short staffed so we be still work on this we report the number of intervention but we also have career conversation informal conversation also we be not sure what to count formal conversation impromptu conversation or book in meeting we be gradually change our approach base on what be describe by the pnas nh throughout the many account we hear there be an overwhelming sense of personal commitment and hard work to ensure a robust roll out of the pna programme while recognise opportunity to adjust to do thing differently a need along the way hei and pna lead have be develop supportive organisational structure and reward opportunity to improve positivity in the workplace many great example be share and some of these be list a additional half day teach for quality improvement methodology pdsa staff survey to gather feedback from lead pnas pnas rcs nurse clinical psychologist to support staff pnas and rcs nurse share in box for pnas webpage on intranet with resource easy to access librarian resource support monthly celebration of achievement lanyard and badge to identify achievement a reporting structure create to feedback to the board board to ward chief nurse involvement with pnas regular listening workshops a time to talk service with wellbeing officer what s app group for pnas the work relationship between hei and healthcare organisation reveal characteristic that exemplify when thing be successful and continue to develop across the case these be summarise a figure figure characteristic of successful hei institution and healthcare case lead pnas operate a a wide pnas be give time strategic plan with interpretation of to functionalise their careful selection of pna role link with role nurse for pna role clinical supervision they utilise exist they link the pna pnas be develop forum to drive the role with others through cpd and pna e g practice personal implementation educator development plan they attend event huge sense of well engage to share idea and sustainability it be support via pna celebrate not a project it be office achievement here to stay the interview introduction in section the interview data from interview conduct with hei lead regional pna and site pna lead pnas and rcs

data be prepared and summary make with a selection of transcript member check data be organise and manage use a framework approach ritchie et al inform by the evaluation objective question and theory laschinger et al data be retrieve and subsequently analyse from each framework category ritchie et al throughout the five participant group to reveal the range of theme and sub theme the theme the interview establish the baseline provision of clinical supervision before the programme be introduce the delivery of the pna programme with benefit and challenge and idea which would help to sustain the programme nurse describe their experience of clinical supervision throughout their career for some this be over year individual experience be influence by the length of nhs service and the different clinical setting they have work in for some their familiarity with supervision be personify through a traditional managerial model where clinical supervision continue professional development and appraisal be interlink conversely for distinct group of staff such a health visitor mental health nurse and child s nurse supervision be a regular occurrence normalise and integrate into their usual practice in contrast some nurse state that supervision have never be a feature regardless of their length of nurse career or setting where they work baseline provision of clinical supervision before the pna programme during the implementation of the pna programme determine a baseline position amongst pna trainee be an important starting point to understand their experience of participation in supervision four sub theme be describe here awareness experience and provision of clinical supervision potential benefit of good supervision perceive usefulness of exist supportive restorative service and time staffing and approach use to deliver supervision awareness experience and provision of clinical supervision in general prior to the pna programme emerge supervision feature only marginally in nurse experience a illustrate below every presentation pna programme implementation every meeting the question be ask how much clinical supervision have you have since you ve qualified and it s very little i ve get nurse that be probably in their s and s that never have clinical supervision it s not be value and they never put it in place rpnal whilst educator be experience in this field it be often remark that the concept and delivery of supervision be new for many practise nurse i ve professionally be immerse in this whole area of practice clinical supervision really since well so way back when it probably feel new for many people so none of it s new for me because it s almost second nature and it s evolve so it evolve from what it be even within the statutory model to how it end before statutory supervision demise heip it seem that nurse exposure to clinical supervision be relate to the specific characteristic of the clinical team and the commitment in various setting which drive the success for this to be embed a part of practice so my experience of the clinical supervision go back year and year because i ve get experience from district nursing and year ago clinical supervision the reflective model have always be predominantly embed into district nursing and health visiting and so we use to run our own clinical supervision group i be the lead for that within the trust at the time about roll out a model and a policy erm accessibility for staff into that clinical supervision program session and then more recently with the transition to acute i d say about nine year ago acute have never hear of it so it become obvious it really be a community base reflective model that be know about a lot but in the acute they d never hear of it lpna where clinical supervision be deliver by management supervisor this be describe a a tick box exercise nurse do not feel like they could be truly honest with their superior for fear of retribution this lead to frustration nurse felt they be not able to get the most from their clinical supervision session and this lead to the development of supervision stigma a remark it be more about your boss your hierarchy say oh yes we ll look after you and your supervisee think yeah sure you will and be cage in and you didn t feel like you could open up and say how it really be you didn t feel like your job would be protect you think oh they ll get rid of me i ll be sack if i say too much about l if i speak up and call people out pna finally some pnas and rcs nurse reflect on the lack of clinical supervision throughout their career i ve never have clinical supervision never be offer it never really speak about it pna the scope of experience indicate demonstrate the contrast provision and uptake of clinical supervision in nurse prior to the pna programme the potential benefit of good clinical supervision despite the varied experience of clinical supervision nurse reflect a good understanding of the potential benefit of engage in a process of support be it available to them several nurse describe cop without access to support and adopt undesirable strategy such a shelve or retain problem which cause a range of psychological effect and career decision one lead pna highlight that a clear need for supervision exist even though nurse might not always be aware of their own need in this area i think if people haven t have it they don t miss it because they don t know what they re miss but if i think back to people i ve work with over the year i think there be people who have leave who might have stay if they d have access to clinical supervision i think i ve work with people who have call off sick with stress relate issue that probably could have stay well with clinical supervision lpna an extremely positive perspective of the potential of clinical supervision be exemplify by the following nurse i m a mental health nurse since i have have supervision ever since i start nursing and i couldn t have do my job without supervision the foundation of clinical supervision start in psychiatry back in the old asylum so for me it s just be there it s one of those thing i m a huge advocate of supervision i don t think anybody particularly clinical staff can be do their job without supervision i think it s dangerous so my experience of supervision i ve have some amazing supervisor i ve have one or two that haven t be so amazing and it s just work with that really so i m a real advocate of clinical supervision lpna benefit in term of workforce care quality staff well be staff development be describe by the hei lead relate to education and development i mean there s huge variance regard benefit but i m thinking of a couple of student in particular come to my mind and their word be i be able to stay it s refresh my career i m now use all my skill that i ve have over the whole of my career and i m reenergised it s almost what s happen with some of our legacy nursing and legacy midwife in term of keep people that end of career bit but this doesn t necessarily mean end of a in thirty year down the line it s retain people in a different way heip the poignant example below illustrate how supervision at critical moment in a nurse s career could have significant impact in recover and learn from mistake in practice i remember after make my first drug error not want to give anyone any medication ever again and actually have someone to talk that through with rather than just work you know you speak it through with your friend but i think in situation like that clinical supervision would have help me to process it quick and hopefully then it wouldn t have affect me for as long a it do pna the potential benefit of resolve anxiety through restorative clinical supervision be also reflect upon i think if i have chance to develop and understand what my anxiety be about i probably would have stay within the clinical role more than go into the educational role pna these example from practice reflect different experience that positively or negatively influenced nurse wellbeing and ultimately sometimes the choice make throughout their career it be evident that many nurse felt that restorative clinical supervision have a role to play in support nurse to practice effectively perceive value of supportive restorative service prior to the national launch of the pna programme it seem the availability of clinical supervision be not widespread and if available uptake be poor nurse discuss a range of supportive restorative service that be available to them e g access to a clinical psychologist access to human resource staff and chaplaincy nevertheless for some these service be perceive a inappropriate the key reason be the lack of relatedness and share experience of be a nurse and thereby understanding problem from a nursing perspective a illustrate the only service that be available for u to go and talk to be this clinical psychologist for half an hour whilst on shift and it be just not i can t go and spill my bean and put my bean all back in a box rcs the hospital we do have psychologist we do have chaplain and we do have i prefer the other one it s the support for other staff a well wellbeing hub so we do have that kind of stuff but i don t know i haven t utilise that very much i feel more comfortable with the pna it s just because she be a nurse a well i m a nurse she can understand me rcs i think there be definitely something around that share experience and that understand so for example a nurse to a nurse well i ve walk in your shoe you know pna hence it would seem there have be a gap in support deem to be appropriate prior to the introduction of the pna programme for many nurse who prefer peer to peer support from other nurse colleague time staff and approach use to deliver clinical supervision many participant suggest the main reason that clinical supervision have not be a prominent feature within nursing have be lack of time to deliver due to insufficient staffing in clinical setting the way in which clinical supervision be deliver impact on the spread of provision and equity of access throughout nurse regional pna lead identify that whilst supervision in nursing have overall be scarce it be more embedded for some group of staff by comparison to others for example mental health nursing be identify a more likely to have embed clinical supervision lead pnas reflect on one of the big challenge in the implementation of the pna programme relate to the time commitment need time accessibility be a major barrier have time to be relieve and how do that look these people still have a job so you ve got nurse in intensive care who might be sister they can t leave and provide an hour or you ve got staff work in casualty so it s very difficult for staff unless they ve be give that protected time to deliver but also the accessing of it again be down to how good the manager be so if we ve get manager who be supportive of staff to access it it might be a case of them access in their own time if they do it s still very unsure be they get that time back so that could be a barrier because you might be think why should i when i ve get a busy life anyway and how much sessional time be you gon na support be it gon na be an hour a week an hour a month what do that look like some place be look at hour a month but then other place might go i really can not relieve a pna for hour a month from exist duty that they have to do they ve employ them to do because actually i ve get vacancy rate i ve get sickness rate i can t get bank or agency lpna depend on the approach use may have mean clinical supervision be subsume within post graduate programme rather than be part of everyday nursing practice so from my experience work with an acute provider the majority of nurse that get supervision be predominantly speciality nurse so thing like clinical nurse specialist midwifery they be very much ring fence identify for clinical supervision when it come down to the general nursing register nursing it be very it be very ad hoc i think one of the reason be the time factor the other reason be that i think a lot of them badge add this on to other programme like the preceptorship programme or one to one whereas the restorative clinical supervision programme be so much more than that rpna l many nurse describe the contrast delivery of clinical supervision across different area of the nursing workforce yeah with me it wasn t a thing when i be work in itu i know about it because i d get friend that work in mental health and learn disability nursing and it be a real big thing with them pna a number of nurse identify the need to roster in advanced to allow space for clinical restorative supervision it be note that this be a challenging aspiration in the context of short staff i think it s organisational i think generally we can see that the nh whichever hospital you walk in no where s adequately staff i mean in my trust they do try about ten to fifteen year ago actually they do train ward manager go to local university and do training for supervision but when they try to put that into practice there wasn t the time to pull people off to sit and talk to them for an hour it never get do pna nursing have always be so busy and most nurse always put their patient first and there s always something else to do nursing have never be very good at give nurse any time out of the clinical work phase pna deliver the pna programme at each level of the pna programme implementation distinctive challenge be describe the big cross cut theme relate to the organisation and administration of the programme challenge be broadly express by regional pnas in relation to the recruitment of pnas lead pnas describe the speed of recruitment require course content and variation of this across england pnas themselves describe a mixed response to their training and the reality of implementation in practice rcs nurse describe frustration with the difficulty be release from practice for clinical supervision three broad theme emerge a challenge to overall programme delivery benefit of restorative clinical supervision and challenge relate to the delivery of supervision in practice challenge to overall programme delivery this data relate to the regional pna and site lead with several account give regard issue relate to recruitment and retention of pnas to the pna programme in the following quote the regional pna lead explain that pna course recruitment and retention issue occur due to the lack of time for healthcare trust to release staff for the course so administratively it s be quite a pickle because it s such a short time frame to ask for nurse to be release that we be we ve be scramble sometimes to get enough to fill cohort at the right time then you ll manage to fill them but you ll then confirm place with people then you ll get people pull out because they just can t get release so whether that s more support need in trust for them to be release when they re give a place whether we need to be more forceful with no this be your place you need to take it and you need to work out how you do that i don t know but that that can be frustrating rpnal p some of the lead pnas and pnas describe a lack of standardisation in the delivery of the pna programme assessment across the different heis and the issue this create for them my experience be such a differential in each provider so you might get some university want credit some be want credit some be do credit and you didn t have a choice it be a case of you get send to the university and it might be credit for you it might be credit for you and i don t think that really be think through because then you have some staff who didn t want to credit and do a word essay as well a everything else and then you have to staff who do want to do credit so that cause a bit of mayhem a bit of extra stress i be get different feedback from different university well from different people attend different university because i don t think it s standardise enough lpna i think it the assessment should be standardise because it cause trouble it cause frustration especially those that have the more in depth assessment pna it appear that the rush to recruit nurse contribute to some manager nominate their staff rather than staff voluntarily complete the programme this meant that some nurse and manager be unprepared and do not know what to expect i don t think with hindsight my manager really know what the role be so i don t think there be much awareness of actually what i be sign myself up to pna while others nurse describe the lack of time to apply and prepare themselves for the course we have ten minute to get our application form in we have no idea what we be let ourselves in for because at that point there really wasn t any information about it and i didn t know about the pma role at that point either so no i know absolutely nothing other than my matron say to me i volunteer you to do this course i be like oh okay then you ve get ten minute to get your application form in the course start in a couple of day and i don t know what s involve in it i be like oh okay pna these be important issue to be resolve for each partner in the process of the pna programme delivery in particular the timing of the recruitment for the prospective pnas require adequate readiness to study such a arrange the commitment of time prior reading and a described get in the zone these be regard a key success factor for post graduate study benefit of restorative clinical supervision across the participant group many benefit be describe regard the difference that restorative clinical supervision have make or have the potential to make each group give example base on their level of involvement with the pna programme the rcs group a key benefactor in this model stress many benefit and outcome of the pna model in deliver rcs whether through the ideal model of delivery or the adapted brief model of delivery the regional pna lead emphasise that the pna programme be about offer support to professional not solution it s give people the opportunity to reflect and a a pma or a pna you re not there to provide the solution you re there to listen and let that person find the in many way direct them well not direct them but get them to come to some sort of solution some sort of action plan rpnal we learn about the need to report restorative clinical supervision delivery via workforce return we understand from this that there be some confusion regard what constitute restorative clinical supervision and whether to count short burst of contact a illustrated i think people just need to recognise that a corridor conversation can be a contact you know if you ve have that minute for somebody who s really distressed and you ve make a difference then you need to be able to count it but nurse don t they think it s you get to sit down you get to be away in privacy from the clinical area but it s about recognise that it rcs come in different form really some of it people be do walk around the ward you know so they re take trolley and they re go around and they re talk about the role and people come up and have a chat to them and some of those conversation might be a bit more in depth than others rpnal flexibility of approach use for supervision accord to circumstance be echo by a nurse who have receive rcs i think there be some session that need to be away from everybody else where that person can whether they need to absolutely break down and just lose it and then put that armour back on again it depend on the situation but i think you definitely could do a part of your morning huddle with the team so what s go on with your patient today it can be bring in like that rcs pnas describe numerous benefit associate with the pna model but be clear that nurse who be not directly involve with the programme be aware of them some nurse identify that effective and timely supervision have retain them in nursing and have enable them to overcome significant workplace relate wellbeing problem have some restorative supervision from a really excellent supervisor really help me remain in work and be effective in my job actually it do give me the insight and confidence to think i m ready to move on and that s how i end up move on and come into this role really i think that supervision i have at that point be quite a pivotal thing for me pna we interview pnas through this we learnt of many other benefit regard their role in deliver restorative clinical supervision these be summarise in figure figure summary of the benefit of rcs delivery identify by pnas benefit of rcs identify by pnas improvement in personal self care improve work life balance increase enjoyment at work improve mental health and well be enhance life satisfaction improve home life well be improve personal and professional development improve relationship and teamwork whilst at work enhance nhs s image due to healthy and happy workforce enhance resilience a large number of effective service improvement improve retention of staff improvement in nurse empowerment improve confidence of staff well job satisfaction smoother transition for overseas staff come to the uk improved delivery of patient care improved physical and mental health of nurse low sickness level personal and professional benefit to the pnas conduct rcs almost all rcs nurse interview present their experience of rcs positively emphasise the restorative element by pnas and the importance of this to support them in practice i think sometimes we just need that somebody who win t be judge u like somebody be just there to listen to u somebody who will just accept what we re feel rather than say you do this you do this and you do this it s just a way for you to open up yourselves without be judge rcs it allow you an opportunity to talk about the challenge that you deal with and in fact you start to work thing out for yourself but that only happen when you express those thought and also sometimes there be share feeling that you don t realise that perhaps people do experience as well so i think that s really useful and just simply a little bit of time out from the usual hustle and bustle be beneficial rcs the responsiveness and understanding from individual pnas task with the delivery of the model and follow up nurse s post supervision to develop a supportive relationship rather than supervision be view a a one off event be also exemplify yeah there s be follow ups and it s be very very informal it s mainly be when we ve be both be stand in the nero queue for our coffee and it s like be you alright how be thing do you want to chat i m just upstairs and i have pop up to see her and i ve borrow the odd book off her and thing so it s be very very informal i know that i felt if i need a formal session i could email her and say can we have so and so please and it would be sort straightaway rcs many other key benefit outcome of the pna model be voice by the rcs nurse notably many of these align with laschinger s model of empowerment particularly psychological empowerment and the development of positive work feeling figure figure the benefit of the pna model identify by rcs nurse increase retention reduce feel value stress benefit and outcome of the pna improve decreasd model patient burnout care increase job morale and satisfaction enjoyment strategy use during supervision by rcs nurse be also identify which have the potential to strengthen it benefit or outcome in the future a listed have the opportunity to talk through challenge and share feeling rather than shelve or retrain them learn how to work thing through for oneself solution learn how to express thought and feeling gain trust and insight take some time out from work during period of high stress validation of how someone be feel learn how to deal with difficult situation more effectively insight experience ensure that work issue be not carry outside of work containment challenge to the delivery of restorative clinical supervision in practice challenge relate to a lack of hand on practical experience to deliver rcs be identify by pnas a problematic this be recognise by lead pnas and feedback to hei lead who work hard to remedy issue raise lead pnas and pnas be concern that the content and delivery of pna module do not always fully prepare them to deliver rcs nobody s ever observe me and say yes that s how you do it or no it isn t you re just leave to get on with it and that to me be the big failing of the university course pna similarly some pnas felt the course be too theory base and the online delivery only option available during covid period prohibit the practical application of deliver the role after the course a describe by this participant what now what happen now how do i do restorative clinical supervision and i think that s what we re see with some of our pna s come out from university well i haven t even do restorative clinical supervision so i don t really know what i need i don t really know how to do it pna a lead pna describe how the hospital try to mitigate this challenge by offer in house training opportunity to prepare their nurse to deliver rcs during and after the pna programme just attend a piece of training do not make you competent at deliver restorative clinical supervision but then we also build in access to rcs for about session at least with a supervisor so there s role model there s that emotional experience of what it feel like the appreciation of each other s role and contribution listen to how the supervisor question and responds and then we also give them the opportunity of do a practice run with someone else or one of u and so they re actually build up skill real life skill rather than just follow and watch a video lpna we also hear extremely positive account from hei provider where module have be modify to reflect pna feedback for example the introduction of role play record to practice rcs with peer group feedback and aspect which aid the communication skill need in practice a described i realise because at first it be a write reflection and a competency document and there be a very high failure rate because of the lack of academic skill of the cohort the first cohort that i run so i take my thought and idea to the major modification board at the university and say that because of the nature of the role be so hugely dependent on communication skill hugely dependent on presentation skill that a write assignment didn t align with the overall role so i ask and propose that we change it to a presentation an individual presentation alongside the competency document and have to do load of work to amend that the value of that be very evident because there be a tremendous increase in pas rate because those nurse be much more proficient at communication skill heip nearly all pnas identify a lack of time to conduct rcs a a significant issue impede the roll out of the programme while some pnas indicate they have protect time most do not and they felt they be not able to fulfil the role to their satisfaction essentially even with protected time some pnas still be pull back into clinical practice it seem that low band nurse find it more difficult to get the free time to conduct pna related activity some nurse find their own solution and deliver rcs in their own time although this be consider unfair and some trust have even prohibit this i don t have the allocated time and i be not able to release staff for protected time pay time to do it so i haven t be able to run these sort of proper restorative clinical supervision session pna nurse be concern that the speed of introduce the programme could adversely affect it long term sustainability i just know that sometimes the nh can be very quick to put a plaster on a hole rather than take the time to actually properly fix it i m worried that this be go to turn into a quick fix solution that s go to end up go down the drain and not work because they haven t put the right time and resource into it and it s just be rush through that s my big concern really pna nurse reflect that altruistic behaviour could make it hard for some nurse to prioritise restorative supervision for themselves and for others a illustrate by this example i d say that actually some of the people that i manage might say it s difficult to get the time out to do this but i think that s a more of a organisational cultural thing and something that we d have to work on to make people nurse realise that it s important that they have make time to do thing like this rcs despite the obvious tension in deliver restorative clinical supervision the underlying motivation of the pnas be embody through make a difference even if i don t know i only speak to five people a week or five people a month even and i make a difference then that be worth it i don t have to speak to people last month i only speak to one person but they then haven t now leave the profession i consider that a win pna in this situation it be not about the volume of rcs deliver but the impact of delivery whilst have adequate time to deliver rcs be a predominant challenge nurse also identify stigma associate with receive rcs some nurse felt that visit a pna for rcs could indicate something negative to others e g poor mental health or a negative incident that have occur a illustrate by the following example there s a little bit of stigma when somebody be go for that rcs because people think that they re not mentally stable they re emotionally not stable and there be still that stigma that they re not okay that s why they need to go to rcs rcs i always think clinical supervision be what happen when you re kind of be performance manage or review so it when i first hear about it i be like oh my god what have i do wrong rcs although the perception of available time and staffing resource be prominent barrier to the delivery of clinical restorative supervision other important barrier voice by the rcs nurse as illustrate in figure figure challenge describe by the rcs nurse regard receive rcs awareness of the role just get on no physical with it space to do culture rcs pna and rcs barrier not want prior relationship manager to with available know pnas unsure of confidentality despite some difficulty in delivering and receive rcs a willingness to overcome problem and find solution be evident throughout the interview future sustainability of the programme all staff engage in the programme believe it be a positive enterprise to benefit nurse key aspect discuss be share experience to learn from each other building and maintain relationship the organisational structure require for successful delivery adapt the programme delivery and continued funding be see to be crucial to sustain the programme the regional pna lead discuss the importance of building and maintain relationship across the range of key player involve in the implementation of the pna programme the national team lead pnas pnas and the heis for example the regional pna below reflect on the important way they work with and support each other and how their role drive the programme forward we re all on the positive side we all get on really well we meet when we can every week we work in a collaborative way we try we don t try and do something completely different so i think there s a lot of cohesion we re always willing to help each other and support for example i ve not be able to fill this cohort and i m like well i ve get so many on the wait list can they come on yours can they come in your number you know not to underestimate the role of the regional pna lead both in drive it forward there have be sometimes where you know you get those operational pressure and it s really tough go but it s to keep that sort of momentum and positivity go and that be so now that it s become a movement regional pna lead felt their role should continue to feature in the infrastructure of the programme in the future to aid the national oversight i do think you need a regional role even if it s just at one day a week or two day a week i can t see it work otherwise i know that they want they re take about local leadership yes local leadership be fine but someone s go to have to inspire them and get them to agree to fill up place and then look after their colleague otherwise they re go to be have i don t know how many trust there be in the country and something trust contact the national team but the programme need some sort of regional base leadership just to help coordinate it and keep it together whilst there be funded place so there s only one more year after that maybe thing will be embed enough that it can sustain itself and the national team can bring it together rpnalint if regional role be to be successfully reduce in line with the long term national plan it be suggest that lead pnas should be available at every trust this be see a an important role in it own right but it be note that compete priority often reduce the capacity to organise and manage the delivery of the programme so hopefully my vision in two year every provider will have a dedicate pna lead that s might not be full time might only be two or three day a week so then actually that person who s get the capacity to push the programme forward within the organisation so that s my vision they ve all get a pna lead but again it depend like me i ve get i m do pna i m do lot of different role isn t it so then they re not all dedicate they re not all dedicate to the pna they re probably juggle the corporate responsibility rpnalint it be identify that the delivery of the programme be generate the potential for research with question contemplate regard the effectiveness of current delivery in practice setting it s a reality versus the theory and in time to come they ll probably start write up more research about that actual transition of theory into reality because i think yes we ve get lot of research data about an hour and we book them in and we follow them up and thing like that and that s really good but what about the minute what difference do that make and so that data collection you know and we re have discussion now we re like how do we collect that data how do we make it easy so we can collect it and it doesn t get forget forget how can we actually go back to the people that access it and ask them do it make a difference but actually do it also make a little bit more difference to how you can face your day your resilience refresh reset you you know so there s a lot of i think work around that lpna the hei lead offer their perspective regard the oversight need to support and sustain the education of pnas in practice setting in this case evolve the programme in line with challenge in healthcare i will always every cohort look to improve the module as much a i can improve the content updating thing make sure it s contemporary and it reflect contemporary healthcare need heip and in this case one provider reflect about the style of delivery and how this might need to change to adequately prepare pnas for their role i think we could do more restorative clinical supervision activity where it be one to one and where we can potentially film and feedback and then debrief so a little bit like that so they felt a bit more confident to go out and hit the ground run a i m not so sure they do at the moment heip there be a suggestion of clinical supervision be a mandatory part of every healthcare professional s role every nurse and midwife healthcare professional physiotherapist occupational therapist paramedic must have restorative clinical supervision or they must have pna or pma or whatever that would make a huge amount of difference that would make it real heip the influence that the programme be already have be also reflect upon positively with the caveat that this will need to be adequately funded i hope it continue to get the level of funding to support it i think even if it didn t i think there s an appetite now and that s quite excite i think a i say there s people that can see their career trajectory go in another way because of it which be something they d not think of really heip and finally the ultimate benefit of the programme for the future workforce be encapsulate by this description this workforce will come out know that the professional advocate be there a part of a support network and will utilise them a part of their everyday work life which be what we want because then we want them to be more resilient and that s what we aim to do so hopefully that s what will happen heip pnas frequently discuss the need to learn from pmas as well a other pnas comment that the role should not be carry out in isolation some respondent felt the role should not be exclusive to nurse consequently it be believe that the pna model have the potential to be implement across other profession engage all professional all healthcare professional within the mdt i don t think there s one pna that i know feel like this be exclusive to nurse it start in midwifery and it be deem not exclusive to midwifery it s now in nursing as well and i think midwife and nurse see that this be something to be launch across healthcare generally pna it be also view a have the potential to create great multidisciplinary relationship you could have a nurse to a paramedic for example and then you would have share learning and respect for each other s role as well a understand which be what we want to develop that relationship amongst our workforce as well so that s why we make it multidisciplinary pna the value of the pna role in relation to newly recruit international nurse be mention it be recognise a a transition that could be stressful and where rcs might help support individual it will be beneficial for the overseas nurse when they come here for example they re newly hire into the hospital it would be a good time for them to have rcs when they arrive to prepare themselves emotionally and physically because they re overseas nurse and they can feel that somebody can support them emotionally especially when you re in a foreign country and you don t have family member like anxiety and depression can easily strike them rcs the rpnals emphasise the importance of the programme and reinforce that the future direction be around nurture and embed the programme within the trust i think it s an absolutely brilliant project it s something that we need it s something we ve get to embed and we ve get sustain rpnalint conclusion the three aspect of laschinger s model of empowerment namely structural empowerment psychological empowerment and positive work feeling be represent throughout the evaluation data the aspect of the model be never cite in isolation and be interconnect perspective hence make positive change to improve the pna programme be complex and an appreciation of the connection between national regional and site level be require structural empowerment at nhs england programme level the establishment of the pna programme and it gradual roll out through the region of england have be achieve through a centralise well organised approach via the pna office we hear that regional lead be support their site lead but that further backing be need from some director of nurse to deliver the programme for example wide disparity of approach be describe with some site lead pnas juggle many other priority limit the time to invest in implementation of the pna programme nevertheless share of good practice example through the regional network be successful and bring cohesiveness to it delivery hei lead work very closely with partner across all level and demonstrate flexibility to modify the education modules follow feedback their role to support pnas at the clinical interface be also describe positively at the clinical interface recruit nurse to the pna programme be gradually be achieve but the speed of recruitment and last minute reaction to fill available place may not achieve a consistent approach and good organisational spread of pnas structural empowerment be reflect through opportunity create to undertake the pna training and role and for rcs nurse to uptake the process at this level of delivery the predominant resource call for be adequate time and a safe space to participate information to support implementation and to generate interest and support for the model be feature through good example of collective supportive local network not everyone involve however in the pna programme be well connect with some pnas feel isolate in their role informal power for some be enable through the ability to lead the pna work and or rcs session and be express by the relationship with each other for example the building of trust in the rcs relationship be critical to development of informal power formal power seem to be dependent on the position the respondent hold for example the perception be that more senior nurse site lead hold the positional power to support or not adequately support the implementation of the model the relationship here between the site lead and the pnas be critical to the successful delivery of rcs consequently the success of the programme at site level require meaningful commitment of people involve psychological empowerment give at the time of report many nurse have only receive one or two session of rcs the psychological impact of the pna role be mostly articulate a a short term benefit which help nurse receive rcs to feel well the time out for rcs provide release and on return to the clinical area rcs nurse felt more enabled to self manage and cope in stressful intense workplace situation psychological empowerment be realise from a sense of individual personal control and a critical awareness of the environmental challenge this will require transition and commitment move away from an individual perspective of benefit toward relationship with pnas to enable engagement in workplace activity this process be perhaps currently at an early stage with nurse engagement in rcs necessitate individual transition through several stage an early appreciation of this transition be describe by the nurse where their experience of rcs at the outset be dependent on trust building to take this beyond an experience towards share scenario where they could visualise and use support it seem for those who be able to plan future session and these be limit instance they felt invest and be more committed to the collaboration need and finally there be realisation that rcs could help the enactment of change s in the workplace a illustrate in figure figure transition and experience of nurse in restorative clinical supervision experience of nurse in the restorative clinical supervision process t enact r u c reciprocal collaborate r s o find solution e t m plan a m idea share l b solution i i u experience t s i scenario m experience supportive i l e n d n unload g i offload t test n g stage stage stage independence interdependence dependence resolution restoration release it be evident throughout that rcs enable release of emotion and through sharing and collaboration provide degree of restoration positive work feeling rcs be a positive experience it be welcome and look forward to by nurse who have experience the process the immediate outcome of rcs be to feel relieve of an issue and to see a way forward which be always relate in a positive scenario rcs nurse do express commitment to the a equip model in the workplace rcs nurse do not relate the rcs process with job satisfaction but be begin to express feel value in their role and indicate have less inclination to leave the profession some pnas felt their skill to manage staff situation have be improve with reduction observe in overall nurse sickness rate in some area it be however too early to comment on whether rcs result in low level of staff burnout the prerequisite condition must be consider and well think out during implementation to include time for rcs and for pnas to carry out the role private space to conduct the rcs session and good communication regard the plan to involve the key people revisit the theoretical model commitment to the pna programme be the consistent contingent feature throughout this evaluation frequently express a be able to commit through adequate time the implementation of rcs through pnas require the unyielding commitment from staff who be deliver the programme and must not be contingent on have ideal workforce condition e g to release staff it be assert that over time this model will become thoroughly embed in nursing practice and increase engagement in quality improvement activity to improve patient care and workforce wellbeing will emerge hence commitment have be add a a necessary agent of change to the structural and psychological construct of laschinger s model to support the pre exist aspect of commitment which feature in positive work feeling figure figure revisit laschinger s model of empowerment structural empowerment psychological empowerment positive work feeling feature opportunity job meaning feature feature satisfaction improve morale reduces stress self reflection time out increased commitment confidence commitment recognise space empathy stressor information autonomy trust feel value ownership of problem better team support commitment low burnout culture self control a equip realised resource impact prepare to engage in feature activity listen formal power coach support informal participate power explore encouraging christens model this model provide additional insight base on relational aspect of the a equip model progress from the level of simply complete the pna training or attend rcs session require an appreciation of what participation can bring to pnas and rcs nurse and the organisation we hear that it could bridge division in different area of practice through develop pna community for rcs nurse it can increase the understanding of latent issue which sometimes exist beneath the surface in the workplace so it seem that relational empowerment be inextricably link to a trust building process which be ultimately critical to the uptake of rcs from pnas this be describe by christens a transformative empowerment achieve predominantly through the relationship with others in the programme and the benefit this can bring revisit our assumption from the logic model programme theory at the outset assumption relate to the implementation of the pna programme be make at the policy financial and organisational level figure figure original assumption make regard the pna programme as umptions political financial organisational spanning input activity output and out come p

quantifiable in the next month recommendation an embedded approach key to the ongoing success of the pna programme relate to structural support to ensure the ongoing embedding of rcs into nurse practice to ensure that the restorative clinical supervision and pna model be sustain it must be prioritise alongside patient care integrate into practice and normalise it be important that rcs be not view a something that be event driven and deliver at the point of a crisis but instead a core element of nursing practice which may prevent such event crisis from occur education about rcs the pna model be currently not well understand by the profession and individual nurse and be perceive a a very formal service that be use to deal with negative event it be important that the narrative transition from a formalized event drive service to a normalized service that be use for positive event education be need about the pna model what it be how to access it and what the benefit be reduce stigma it be critical to reduce the stigma associate with supervision and stigma associate with poor mental health negative connotation will inhibit update of rcs and prevent nurse from engage in positive help seek practice when nurse lack access to support they be more likely to adopt cop strategy that may be ineffective and harmful well support nurse be more likely to stay in the profession identifying and support pna s in train it be important that sufficient time and thought be give to select nurse for the pna training programme nurse need time to reflect on their decision to apply potential candidate need adequate information about the pna role and what the course be comprise of give that individual nurse will have a preference regard teach style and preferred assessment method candidate would ideally have some choice standardise the assessment process heis involve in the delivery of the training module should work together towards standardise the best element of the assessment process nurse be participate in post graduate work base learning and learn outcome should focus on what be need to enable application in practice currently nurse who have complete the programme network with others and hear of disparity regard the final module assessment this be dispirit and reduces engagement in the process support in practice for pnas to ensure sustainability of the pna model it be important that each trust have an appropriate lead pna the lead pna need adequate protect time to drive the implementation of the role manage and support pna recruitment and training and monitor implementation and impact at an organisational level trust should continue to work together to share best practice and resource due to the difficult topic that may be discuss during rcs it be also important that pnas themselves receive rcs and support time to deliver rcs pnas need time in practice to deliver rcs a quiet and safe space to hold rcs session without these ingredient the benefit of the pna programme will not be fully realised future research there be much more that need to be understood regard the how rcs be develop and how nurse be empower through rcs it be understood that each element of laschinger s model be enablers to delivery of the pna programme and that relational aspect with develop community of pnas be important connection throughout but it be not understood how rcs be deliver at an individual level and whether a progressive rcs model would help track and support individual a trajectory of growth limitation this evaluation take place at pace contract funding and recruitment to study team be finalise in may and study permission during august the study team work hard to minimise any limitation encounter rapid review of literature a protocol guide the review be establish which focus on empowerment and nurse from the pna programme the primary limitation be the focus on nurse give that much of the literature april be generate by the midwife programme the second limitation arise from the quality of literature with a dearth of study contain data regard empowerment this demonstrate that further research regard empowerment from restorative clinical supervision be warrant case study stage one of the case study involve short survey those return be incomplete in all case it be unclear why information be not complete but possibility include not have the information to hand not have time to locate the information need and not have access to the information at the time of complete the part one survey this be mostly remedied during interview where information be request and often provide or send after the interview the original ambition be to invite hei lead and trust pna lead to joint interview but the logistics of this prove impossible to negotiate nevertheless our understanding of heis and nh site to whom they be align reveal that our original envisaged colocations for both be incorrect e g heis be recruit pna trainee from across many site not always collocate regional site lead and pna interview these be conduct a plan in accordance with the maximum variation strategy the study team member mk ac and nb work together to recruit all participant and interview be conduct over day of the week accommodate hour to suit some interview be cancel at short notice by participant and be reschedule where possible despite tenacious attempt to arrange a convenient time one participant miss the end of study deadline for data collection nurse receive restorative supervision rcs numerous and consistent attempt be make from august to november to recruit this group of participant who prove extremely difficult to reach via the agreed mechanism via nhse the initial study communication be distribute via nhse where response be receive from all group of pnas with no response from rcs nurse a poster be also distribute shortly afterwards via nhse a study database be commence and update by mk in a follow up to this nhse be ask to contact site lead and pnas who in turn be ask to contact this group by email we have learn that clinical nurse be not able to regularly access their email while on duty negating response during september advice be seek from nhse regard recruitment strategy this be follow by a risk and mitigation paper discuss with nhse in october appendix page further information be distribute to nhse to remind pnas of the importance of this group of participant include a poster at pna interview participant be ask if they would pass on the study information to rcs nurse for their consideration the survey be adapt to include participant email address if they be prepare to participate in an interview this yield several from the rcs nurse group three twitter appeal be make via nhse and the study pi the principal investigator give a talk about the pna evaluation at a national pna webinar host by nhse this yield many more pnas but not nurse receive restorative supervision

not want to revisit the issue experience nurse may be concern that their privacy will be breach through participation time to be release to participate in an interview be impossible when on duty state by pnas time be not protect evidence a main theme from survey response staff shortage be severe up to shortage and nursing staff be feel burnt out this be one extra thing to do evidence from survey response lack of ability to implement the model in practice reduces the number of rcs nurse available for interview evidence from survey rcs may not recognise restorative element of supervision a supervision informal may not have computer access for ms team or zoom call may not have access to a private area to discuss the restorative supervision process evidence from survey remedial action we will directly contact the pnas n who respond give their email address within the survey indicate they have receive restorative supervision in their pna role within the case study qualitative data pre interview to gain permission approach the lead pnas who indicate they have nurse receive restorative supervision to ask for direct support to reach this group of potential participant other action where we would value your advice input it have be indicate in the interview and survey response that supervision be a rather formal and sometimes intimidating term it be not always use by the pnas we could consider change our terminology to frame restorative supervision a support in practice and refer to the pna interview transcript to guide u far in the language be use by pnas ask to repeat her tweet via twitter but with specific appeal to nurse receive restorative supervision can do same twitter appeal ask about the provider workforce return to understand where rcs nurse be base ask nhse to send a further recruitment email with information sheet to pna site lead to reach nrrs group o we would ask the site lead to approach pnas in person to approach their nrrs for discussion rather than rely on the email o we would ask the pna site lead if an office space can be make available for nrrs use for the interview or telephone call we could create some new information to state that o we can accommodate much short interview to minute o interview be confidential they will be a safe space to feedback their experience o incorporate new terminology replace the word supervision o we can accommodate any time of the day before or after their shift o telephone interview can be accommodate o we will send the interview question in advance of the interview risk to the pna evaluation we may need to request an extension to the evaluation to enable u to recruit the nrrs st participant mean the envisaged finish date january will not be achievable we be concern that the voice of the nrrs will not be present in the final evaluation give the huge enthusiasm from the other participant the risk be this will not be representative of the pna programme reference baumann n how to use the

profile of nurse work in acute medicine unit what be the future lee and myers which examine three key thing why nurse choose to work in acute medicine why they stay in the speciality and why some nurse leave acute medicine be a rapid grow speciality and alongside this growth be a need to understand and address the evolve workforce issue in particular the education and potential training to support the nursing development require with this in mind the original study from be enhance to a multi site enrolment totally amus across region who respond to the survey it be conduct between in two phase namely collection of demographic detail follow by detail concern motivation and personal insight into the acute medicine workforce survey monkey on line commercial platform be use for both element of the data collection the qualitative data gather have provide an rich insight into the perspective of the nurse who work in acute medical unit and from this an understanding of the current workforce issue it be hop that the research will inform the future recruitment retention and the shape of the nursing workforce in acute medicine key message of the nurse survey express that they feel very positive about work in acute medicine with only express negative aspect amu nurse survey report march reason to stay in acute medicine be express a positive for the variety of work and experience gain reason to leave acute medicine be cite a be due limit career progression lack of resource staff and lack of recognition of acute medicine a a speciality for nurse would nurse work in acute medicine make the same choice if they have the opportunity to start their career all over again of the nurse survey say yes that they would make the same choice it be express that acute medicine be not yet adequately recognised outside of the clinical area itself a a developing speciality for nurse this have consequence for nurse development and recruitment of staff the fast pace relentless workload and staffing shortage be frequently cite a be the most morale reducing and de motivate factor this have consequence for the retention of nurse staff the diversity of patient challenge and teamwork be frequently cite a morale enhancing and motivating factor the key quality and skill require to work in acute medicine be define in the following category namely organisational communication clinicaland personal skill for example personal skill frequently cite be keep calm under pressure amu nursing survey report march core area for skill train be broadly identify across ten area with arterial blood gas sample analysis cpap x ray interpretation and dementia training form the most frequently suggest skill area by those who participate in the research recommendations this research paint the current landscape in acute medicine which continue to need revisit amidst technological advance increase patient acuity an age population all of which create an ever increase diverse workload four key recommendation have be draw which be clear way marker to aid the direction of travel for those work to begin to shape the future nurse workforce in acute medicine lead nurse from acute medicine unit should undertake a skill analysis across all nurse banding to identify the gap the current training need of their staff map against the skill area suggest in this research to keep this work update it be far recommend that this be repeat yearly by individual nurse prior to appraisal this process will assist in identify personal development plansand continue professional development set in context the wider need of acute medicine a thorough understanding of the nursing workload dependency within acute medicine unit be urgently require to keep pace with the acuity and volume of patient assess and admit current workforce tool do not provide sufficient information to ensure acute medicine unit be able to set their staffing level adequately safely this be a piece of work which would prove valuable alongside the rcn staff guidance fro general ward amu nurse survey report march staff duty rota need to be develop to take account of the potential for burn out and high stress level it be suggest that adequate time for staff development and cpd be consider with each new rota it maybe possible for amus to consider develop different type of nursing role new where management research service development and training could be incorporate into job description legitimise the development ofsupporting professional activity into job plan acute medicine unit without advanced nursing role need to consider their development in the context of the skill and train need analysis these type of role provide for clinical career progression and align with increase patient acuity in acute medicine notwithstanding these role will need to have a supporting structure in place for continued training and development liz lee nurse representative society for acute medicine amu nursing survey report march introduction this research report build on a preliminary study by lee myers which examine the experience of nurse work in two acute medical unit this study identify that the majority of nurse work in amu be commit to the specialty and have develop skill in the area despite identify some issue relate to workload and lack of career progression nevertheless it be recognise that further in depth research be need to gain a robust understanding of the factor influence nurse decision to choose to work in acute medicine with a view to develop strategy for future recruitment retention and progression through an acute medicine career pathway background instigate and follow a predetermined career pathway remain a relatively new concept for most nurse department of health mitigating factor be multi faceted to include the failure at a national level to recognise of acute medicine a a specialty for nursing for example while it be now recognise for medical staff wish to pursue a career royal college of physician website accessed february it be not yet widely recognise a a definitive career choice for nurse although we have learn that nurse do see acute medicine a an exciting area to work in lee and myers reveal that career stagnation be occur in acute medicine give the time nurse five year be employ in a particular banding s pursue a specific career pathway in acute medicine for nurse require support at a national level to enable new mechanism for career progression from band to band this mean that the current system of wait for a vacancy to arise and navigate your own career path through experience gain along the way before progression can occur be career limit except for the fortunate few www skillsforhealth uk navigation through career option currently rely upon entry amu nursing survey report march point and academic progression and be contextually apply to setting for example knowledge and experience may not always be accredit or transferrable concentrate upon these issue alone will not enhance or facilitate career progression in acute medicine specialist career pathway can only be progress if upon pre requisite academic criterion and experience there be a recognition and reward through career pathway whilst the attention within this report be focussed upon acute medicine it be think that this be not the only clinical area where problem of this nature exist rationale of the study objectives acute medicine be one of the fast grow specialty in the uk royal college of physician but a yet there have be no exploration of the nursing workforce issue specific to the specialty there be a need to understand the reason why nurse choose to work in acute medicine to explore the factor that encourage them to choose this a a career option and to determine the education and training require to support appropriate professional development specific to the specialty study aim objective aim to understand nurse perception of work in amu to aid development of a workforce strategy to support recruitment and retention of amu nurse objective understand nurse perception of work in amu identify factor that would aid nurse

reason for work in acute medicine follow the same pattern a colleague reason therefore will be present together the majority of nurse survey be draw to acute medicine by the acute nature of patient the fast pace the inter professionalism the unpredictability and diversity of medical condition treat some nurse join acute medicine because of career opportunity acute medicine be perceive to be intellectually and emotionally challenge a good environment to develop and transfer knowledge and skill career development a good opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team to make a difference to patient and an opportunity to influence the service no clear relationship seem to exist between positive factor and year of practice or previous experience i really enjoy acute admission and have opportunity to work with a vast range of medical condition i think the fast pace and quick turnover of patient would be challenge a good environment to maintain develop and learn a wide range of skill participant year in acute medicine initially it be to serve a a gateway to work in ed a i think it would be good experience however i learn so much and love the acute side of it whilst still be able to care for my patient for long than four hour so stayed participant year in acute medicine amu nursing survey report march the acute care appeal to some nurse i feel you be either born to nurse acute

participant year in acute medicine fear of unknown i feel that all student nurse should be give the opportunity to work within acute medicine to gain an insight into the ethos of the clinical area the constant problem with bed management and the acute medical unit take the hit for this on a daily basis participant year in acute medicine not everybody like the unpredictability of the work and many

acute medicine it have evolve over the year participant year in acute medicine poor staff ratio for unpredictable workload participant year in acute medicine it have be very difficult at time however the way the mdts work within acute medicine be excellent much more of a team than the other area where i have work nurse opinion seem to be value a lot more participant year in acute medicine much busier so much more to learn participant year in acute medicine it have give me more opportunity than i imagine and have keep my interest participant year in acute medicine it have change so much over

those patient stay a brief period i think this could be streamline to allow nurse to spend more time with their patient i realise just how difficult an area it be to work in especially for very junior nurse if adequate senior support be not available i realise just how challenge it be to balance the need and expectation of the variety of patient admit participant year in acute medicine figure overall how do you feel about work in acute medicine very positive i love it moderately positive it s mostly good indifferent neither positive or negative moderately negative it s mostly bad very negative i hate it n amu nursing survey report march figure have you try to find a job in another specialty since you have be work in acute medicine yes no n why do do you want to move for those nurse survey who have try to find another job whilst work in acute medicine the eleventh code reason to move describes why they decide to do so the nurse that respond that they would like to move from acute medicine report that this be due to the lack of staff and working equipment the lack of motivation the poor quality of care the lack of career development opportunities the excessive pressure some want to quit nursing in general not only acute medicine the excessive managerial issue and the excessive expectation and workload most of them would like to move in order to develop far and to foster job progression progression in my role a a nurse participant year in acute medicine poor quality of patient care unsafe workload lack of timely breaks lack of staff to monitor patient whilst on a break lack of work and available equipment go home exhaust participant year in acute medicine the pressure a a band be even more intense i have be a band for year now and i have watch the unit become more and more compromised due to managerial decision and lack of awareness of the impact these decision have on the unit and indeed the nh i want to leave nursing not just amu amu nurse survey report march participant year in acute medicine further experience of the critically ill patient i work in itu for year participant year in acute medicine i be drown in paperwork management issue a the senior sister on the unit too much be expect in my trust we be face a real crisis in this role a it be become more difficult to recruit into to reach a senior sister position be once a real aim in the profession it no longer be participant year in acute medicine my job role be change at one point into something that be poorly think out and ill define with no discussion with me at all this leave me demoralised and angry in the end i work towards change the role i be give into something completely different and stayed participant year in acute medicine i want to far develop my clinical skill in acute medicine and i have by work in medical hdu which be still part of acute medicine participant year in acute medicine what change would encourage you to continue to work in acute medicine the twelfth code reason to stay describe what change would encourage nurse who respond they want to move from acute medicine to continue to work in this speciality this question have a low response rate a not many nurse reply they be try want to find a job outside acute medicine participant explain that it would probably be easy to stay in acute medicine if there be more opportunity for people to progress and develop if there be a good nurse to patient ratio well equipment and few episode of staff shortages other reason be a managerial focus on quality of care rather than balance budget and good strategic and operational planning by manager it seem that despite it flaw most nurse would never consider leave acute medicine more opportunity for people to progress and develop participant year in acute medicine amu nursing survey report march well nurse to patient ratio on amu we admit gp admission and they be among the most unwell often can take half an hour plus to admit properly feel lack of available staff do directly influence timely med poor quality care staff exhaustion well equipment less patient come through the unit more staff and the trust return to a patient centre trust instead of a money sign participant year in acute medicine i come back to acute medicine participant year in acute medicine more support participant year in acute medicine i will probably stay anyway because however bad it get i be sure that after a few week elsewhere i would miss acute med i wish there be some more join up think in management and a whole hospital approach to improve patient flow participant year in acute medicine continue opportunity to develop clinical skill proper workforce tool to identify staff need in acute medicine thereby retain workforce participant year in acute medicine get the nurse patient ratio right more time and support for train streamlining of nursing assessment and documentation participant year in acute medicine how do you feel about the opportunity for career progression in acute medicine the thirteenth code career opportunity describe how nurse feel about the opportunity for career progression in acute medicine the majority of nurse survey have negative feeling towards career opportunity and self development in acute medicine career opportunity be see to be either fairly limited poor restrict or non existent there be a general feeling that there be not much opportunity for band and staff apart from secondment unless they aspire to be a ward manager band or a specialist nurse in a general medicine speciality at ward manager level a limited progression exist to matron lead nurse or consultant nurse with promotion often necessitate a movie away from acute medicine amu nursing survey report march for some nurse their experience regard career development have be very positive these nurse feel that the potential for development of advanced practice role in acute medicine be excellent if you be willing to work hard and look for opportunity fairly limited participant year in acute medicine reasonable participant year in acute medicine i do not think there be many opportunity for career progression for nurse on the whole not only in acute medicine i have to move into management to go up the career ladder however a i now have an operational role i enjoy the best of both aspect participant year in acute medicine very positive the potential for the development of advanced practice role in this specialty be huge participant year in acute medicine poor participant year in acute medicine there be not much unless you want to be a ward manager or a specialist nurse in a general medical speciality participant year in acute medicine good if willing to work hard participant year in acute medicine no opportunity whatsoever participant year in acute medicine poor however if you have idea then they should be share quite often i have find you make your own career progression as long a it s sound and contribute i be a senior anp with a research educational background where do i go to participant year in acute medicine it be there if you need it and go look for it participant year in acute medicine amu nursing survey report march personally they have be excellent i have have opportunity to study with funding and support to achieve a degree in specialist practice and be soon to be commence my msc i have work though the old grade system d e to become a sister and be now a nurse practitioner the opportunity have be there for me to work towards participant year in acute medicine i be already a senior ward manager therefore very limited progression i e only matron or lead nurse available or specialist nurse participant year in acute medicine not very good at present a a band there do not appear to be any opportunity to progress into anp role etc this be partly due to the fact that a a band it be not in our job description to undertake nurse prescribe therefore progression be limit to a managerial band post participant year in acute medicine from a nursing management perspective they be quite poor clinical progression to anp be possible participant year in acute medicine they be excite and i hope if it get recognise within nursing a a unique speciality within it own right more opportunity will arise participant year in acute medicine a an anp i be outside the main career pathway for amu staff there be little visible investment in development of band and nurse beyond the secondment of band s into band development post for month however actual development be limit to experience in coordinating and i see them receive little structured development out of the experience there be no plan for develop career or service development by encourage staff to consider branch off into something similar such a np role participant year in acute medicine very good i have be give opportunity to progress participant year in acute medicine limit i be constantly inform that i need to consider promotion but this would mean a move away from acute medicine i never want that i can do what i want as far a service improvement strategy plan etc but this do not move me up the career ladder a such this be as well a my day job but i be happy to continue participant year in acute medicine not sure it be not quite clear cut participant year in acute medicine amu nursing survey report march i have be fortunate in that i have progress to the level i be happy with at present participant year in acute medicine table what be your current pay band and how long have you be at this pay band how long have you be at this pay band to to pay band to year year year total band band band band a band b total what change would make the big improvement to your job satisfaction in acute medicine the fourteenth code job satisfaction describe change that respondent report would make the big improvement to their job satisfaction in acute medicine the nurse interview describe the following factor that could positively influence job satisfaction in acute medicine career progression opportunity to develop skill and knowledge adequate staff and support from management great understanding of acute medicine by others particularly in relation to capacity and flow issue improve staff communication and feedback ability to give a high standard of care less documentation and less pressure on bed nurse prescribe a clear definition of role great recognition for acute medicine and financial investment be also identify career progression develop skill and knowledge participant year in acute medicine adequate staff and proper support from management participant year in acute medicine more understanding from other ward and department especially in relation to capacity issue participant year in acute medicine great understanding of be by other speciality amu nurse survey report march participant year in acute medicine improve staff communication from doctor nurse and all member of mdt able to give a high standard of care i leave feel disappoint that the care i give to patient be force to at time below the ability to be able to provide basic care and proper initial assessment participant year in acute medicine leave participant year in acute medicine safe staffing level participant year in acute medicine my own clinic joint role with education research consultant nurse perhaps but not bother about title participant year in acute medicine more staff patient ratio thereby enable u to provide high standard of care participant year in acute medicine be able to do nurse prescribe participant year in acute medicine i think there need to be clear guideline a to what an amu be and it can not be the answer to all thing a some trust would have it if it be to be use a anything else bar an amu this need to be resourced and system introduce to enable it to function effectively the team need clear definition of their role more acute physician it feel that organisationally blanket risk assessment be be apply to all patient and there be a danger of slow death by drown from documentation staff also require the infrastructure to care for their patient effectively improve back door patient flow would have the big impact on our amu participant year in acute medicine more feedback participant year in acute medicine more downstream bed time to support and mentor junior nurse to ensure staff get break participant year in acute medicine amu feel to me like it be stick in the middle between the ed the medical division ed quality indicator seem to be reduce quality patient be transfer with initiation of amu nursing survey report march treatment sometimes a slightly large bed base in the medical division would allow for amu to slow down slightly and improve quality participant year in acute medicine if manager stop harass the staff who be already work flat out and look a little more critically at the post within the organisation that do not deliver tangible benefit or value for money this be start to happen participant year in acute medicine recognition of acute medicine and investment by the trust participant year in acute medicine career development opportunities good pay and high staffing level especially in high dependency area level participant year in acute medicine workforce tool that capture workload in acute medicine to then allow decision to be make a to how to develop the service for staff satisfaction and retention in acute medicine participant year in acute medicine figure do you feel you have a strong sense of specialist identity work in acute medicine n s e s r u n f o agree strongly agree neutral disagree disagree neither agree strongly nor disagree amu nursing survey report march figure if you be to start your nurse career all over again would you still choose to work in acute medicine no yes n despite the many negative comment about the problem of work in amu the overwhelming majority of nurse would still choose the specialty again amu nursing survey report march discussion main finding sixty two nurse senior complete the organisational phase survey the sample appear to be representative of all region of the uk with the exception of northern ireland more than half of the unit have between and bed while have more than bed thus the unit respond appear to be representative of the wide range of unit across the country the majority of unit have few level bed with many have none the lack of provision for level bed be likely to increase the demand on the amu nursing workforce a they endeavour to provide care for these high dependency patient alongside the relentless pace of admit and discharge less acutely sick patient the rate of monthly admission appear broadly similar to the size of the unit report the length of stay in the unit be under hour for just under half of the respondent but it be acknowledge that the intended length of stay be often exceeded reason for exceed optimum length of stay frequently relate to issue of capacity and flow in the downstream ward and inability to transfer patient who require side room facility for clinical reason a wide range of wte register nurse staffing establishment be report perhaps reflect the differ size and throughput of unit although this can not be assume anecdotally we be aware that there be a significant variation in staffing level even among unit of similar size this be a reflection of the heterogeneity of amus it would have be helpful if we have ask for direct information on staff to patient ratio instead of staff establishment the breakdown of nurse per band reflect the lack of opportunity for progression report in phase of the survey this be a significant cause for concern a we strive to encourage recruitment into the specialty and to promote retention of experienced amu nursing survey report march nurse staff medical staff have clearly define progression through the rank of their chosen specialty that be link to an educational framework research opportunity and financial remuneration respondent report a small number of non registered practitioner within some unit the majority be employ on band and opportunity for progression be limited it be note that even when a training framework be in place attain a high banding be impossible due to the current financial situation many unit report have current vacancy for both registered and non registered staff with frequent use of both bank and to a less extent agency staff to fill gap in staff worryingly only f respondent state that they never have problem fill vacant shift suggest that many unit be work under strength on a frequent basis the reason for vacancy be attribute to high sickness level non filling of post to meet saving target and delay in the recruitment process this be both a risk to patient and to exist staff due to increase workload and risk of burnout sixty five nurse from at least different hospital complete the phase survey for the majority nursing be their first career which be reflect in the preponderance of entrant age year or less almost half of respondent have more than year experience in the amu with three quarter have work in another specialty first this be unsurprising give the relatively new nature of the specialty in many hospital the positive factor which nurses attribute to amu be the fast pace acuity variety and unpredictability nature of the specialty team working and strong inter professional relationship be also highlight frequently for many nurse the amu be report to be intellectually and emotionally challenge with opportunity to develop skill and make a difference to patient however for other respondent the fast pace and acuity of care amu nurse survey report march appear to have a negative effect with too much unpredictability too much pressure and lack of continuity of care cite although there do not appear to be a clear relationship between positive factor year of practice or previous experience the negative comment above appear to be relate to less experienced staff when this be consider alongside the question relate to train education and experiential learning it be clear that more investment and planning be require to meet the need of amu nurse this be bear out by the fact that nurse report require a wide range of training relate to core skill to achieve competence in their current role the acquisition of advanced practice skill be also identify and will be key to develop an appropriate multi professional workforce for the future most concerning of all be the negative comment cite by many nurse even those who be positive about work in amu a a career choice these comment relate mainly to lack of resource poor management support lack of understanding of the demand of amu from other area within the hospital and externally and constant demand to maintain flow even at the expense of quality person centre patient care it be no surprise then that the personal quality deem to be necessary for the amu nurse to survive be as much about calmness persistence and optimism a they be about organisational management and clinical skill despite these considerable difficulty of nurse respond would still choose to work in acute medicine limitation the main limitation of this study be the selection of a convenience sample in both phase although several approach be take to maximise participation in the study the response rate be relatively small and the participant may be more engage in the specialty due to the method of sample thus it can not be assume that the respondent amu nurse survey report march be representative of all amu nurse in the uk however a diversity of view be elicit give some confidence in the finding and replicate the result of the previous pilot study a further limitation be that amus be heterogeneous in nature varying in size configuration and throughput while some be actually combine medical surgical assessment unit the size and throughput of the unit and the hospital may have a significant effect on the experience of the nursing staff which have the potential to bias the result however the result of the phase study show that a range of size of amu have be capture with a reasonable geographical spread across the uk with the exception of northern ireland another limitation be the design of the questionnaire itself which may have be interpret differently by different respondent the inclusion of free text throughout the phase survey be intend to allow respondent to share their view freely and to allow theme to emerge comparison with other literature a general search of the literature be conduct on four database relevant to nurse namely directory of open access journal the cochrane library cinahl and ssrn the search term include three key word initially career nurse and pathways the search be expand with the addition of the word acute acute medicine which yield zero article of relevant the search be repeat with the addition of acute challenge opportunity and plan eleven article be systematically review with five of these form the basis for comparison with other literature the challenge which need to be address in order to implement a robust career pathway for acute medicine nurse be not dissimilar to finding by latter et al in her consideration of the challenge for implement a clinical academic career pathway in nursing for example the general political awareness for support career pathway in this amu nursing survey report march case nurse work in acute medicine need to be raise at a national level and be perhaps of equal importance to any underpinning educational planning require latter find this have be a critical success factor drive the general impetus on clinical academic career presently dh in addition a framework for support reward the evidence of individual development whilst work in acute medicine be also critical a can be see from this research nurse may enter acute medicine from a variety of background this work be exemplify by williams and jordan in who state that portfolio be an underused resource and should be use a a vehicle to contain the evidence from which to format career plan this support the concept of move away from use them for year on year appraisal or nurse midwifery regulation on notification of practice and re registration if we consider further that the entry point of nurse maybe from a variety of area to include newly register nurse marsland and hickey suggest that despite encouragement in nurse training to pursue an acute career unless this expectation be match equal by experience in the speciality we will not achieve nurse who want to climb an acute career pathway acute in this context be not specifically relate to medicine rather whole hospital finally if we consider a range of issue a a conglomerate notably career planning pathway and opportunity it would seem that the extent to which career pathway of nurse truly represent personal choice and opportunity be often limit by the organisation s response to financial constraint which in turn limit it organisational vision and capacity to drive change notwithstanding the national impetus would seem to be a key driver of change in nurse recruitment and career progression robinson et al amu nurse survey report march recommendation for further research clinical practice the finding of this study suggest that there be several critical area which need to be address lack of formal recognition a a nursing specialty outside acute medicine itself lack of professional development opportunity and career progression poor management understanding and support lack of resource capacity equipment and staff capacity and flow issue in downstream ward lead to bottleneck in amu inappropriate documentation conclusion prior to this study the literature reveal no previous research into factor that aid recruitment and retention within acute medicine setting relate to nurse this study utilise an online survey design to elicit the view and experience of registered nurse work within amus to determine these factor for the majority of nurse amu remain a popular career choice with a strong sense of specialist identity despite the limited opportunity for professional development and career progression however the finding of this study suggest that there be considerable work to do to promote the identity of the specialty to manager the rest of the healthcare community and public manager and commissioner hold public purse be responsible for the apportioning of budget to individual area it be hop that those read this report will gain an understanding of how nurse feel and use the information wisely to nurture and develop staff the issue of lack of resource poor management support and stressful working condition require urgent action l we lose large number of highly expert and committed practitioner with serious consequence for patient care lesson can be learn from develop career pathway for amu nursing survey report march nursing in academic career not least raise the national profile of nursing in this acute medicine speciality the result of this study can also be use in further work and at a local level to understand workforce issue and develop a career framework
