Quote from experience of stigma the inability to use the questionnaire a psychologist longitudinally and the absence of validation evidence in people undergoing obesity treatment Below one healthcare

Internalized weight stigma refers to the stigma direct image vote healthcare provider partici towards oneself There be a correlation between inter pant live with obesity A considerable difference be nalized weight stigma and the impact or acceptance of observe in the preference of healthcare provider and partici weight stigma It be important to not only assess inter pant live with obesity Several participant live with obesity nalization but also the effect of weight stigma such a mention that they do not want the focus of body image to be it impact on healthcare engagement and mental or social on physical aesthetic They suggest that a PROM assess health Quote from a researcher body image should focus on the individual perception of their This healthcare provider be support by a participant own body Conversely healthcare provider report that the living with obesity who also highlight the importance of PROMs available for assess body image should accurately capture the impact of weight stigmatize experience capture the individual feeling towards their own body They emphasize that body image change drastically after weight None of the question assess the impact of stigma loss treatment and therefore it be an important measure they only focus on the prevalence of stigma No scale be consider suitable for use in obesity treatment In my experience a a dietitian body image be a

various discipline The PROs er participant live with obesity and PROMs select be IWQOL Lite self esteem Obesity Surgery BODY Q physical function physical symptom psychological The OP scale be not consider suitable for measure social function social function eat behavior and body image function and the PROMIS and OWQOL be not validate and QOLOS excess skin These PROMs contain good for obesity treatment We point out that the selection measurement property ensure that the measurement of qual of PROMs for research purpose or clinical practice may thus ity of life provide valid and reliable outcome This core set far vary significantly from those use in registry A number can be use in different cultural and geographical setting Spe of healthcare provider suggest that some PROMs could be cifically these PROMs be available in and language omit from the core set and that others contain too many respectively No PROM be select to measure stigma question between seven and ten per PRO By omit these because the available PROMs be consider unsuitable To the PROMs feasibility might be enhance and less time would best of our knowledge this be the first multinational and multidis be need to complete the questionnaire According to the ciplinary effort in obesity treatment to achieve the goal of stand participant live with obesity at the meeting omission be ardizing the quality of life outcome that matter most to patient not necessary They do not consider complete multiple The primary objective of the core set be to improve the quality of questionnaire a burdensome provide their purpose be care in obesity treatment by reflect outcome that be most explained and feedback be provide important to patient To this end we incorporate the extensive Using PROMs in clinical practice be increasingly become input of people live with obesity throughout the development of routine In the treatment of cancer for example PROMs be the set The core set represent the selection of PROMs that should use to monitor symptom and quality of life during the pre minimally be use in clinical obesity care operative and postoperative period Their administration The same PROs and PROMs be select for the clinical and interpretation lead to good identification of posttreatment practice core set a for the research core set which allow the symptom and problem enhance clinical decision make same set to be use for different purpose The PROs mostly process and improve communication between patient and align with the finding of Coulman et al They identify healthcare provider The ability of PROMs to improve out eight theme with regard to live with the outcome of meta come in cancer care be far illustrate by Basch et al bolic and bariatric surgery Despite frequent use of the SF They report that in comparison to usual care digital symp in prior obesity treatment research it be not include in the tom monitoring use PROMs significantly improve physical core set a participant favor other PROMs base on face function symptom control and overall quality of life There be validity In a recent validation study by de Vries et al even evidence that PROMs can improve survival in cancer care the SF be not support by sufficient validation evidence In obesity treatment PROM data offer a unique oppor in patient undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery due to tunity to enrich consultation by redirect the focus to those the irrelevance of some question and lack of relevant item aspect that concern patient most or problem that would oth to patient among other reason align with the cur erwise go undetected Sharing PROM data facilitates active rent finding Recently Greene et al establish a selection patient participation in progress tracking and outcome assess of PROMs to be implement in the Metabolic and Bariatric ment thereby enhance communication between patient and Surgery Accreditation Quality Improvement Program in the healthcare provider Using PROMs in obesity USA They identify health self confidence mobility treatment enables healthcare provider to deliver care that aligns and everyday activity a the high ranking PRO domain with patient need and ultimately to provide value base and and select the PROMIS Obesity Related Problem Scale high quality care To further aid implementation of the OP scale and Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life PROMs in clinical practice we develop a user manual for the Instrument OWQOL for inclusion The S Q O T consensus core set Appendix Table meeting take a different approach to select PROMs by Despite the benefit of PROMs there be challenge regard focus on their suitability for the selected PRO domain ing their implementation First the participant live with Obesity Surgery obesity indicate that the lack of feedback on PROM score be only this be unlikely to have bias our result Fourth not all what withhold them most from routinely complete PROMs online participant participate in the entire two day meeting We conclude that PROMs should only be implement in clin either a a consequence of the different time zone or because of ical practice if the score be share with the patient To facili the multiple meeting that be plan prior to the combine tate this process a digital platform be require that automatically congress of the European Association on the Study of Obesity dispatch PROMs before consultation and allow the PROM and the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and score to be display on a dashboard for healthcare provider Metabolic Disorders European Chapter and people live with obesity to see Several electronic During future meeting we shall continue to improve the cur measurement system be propose in the literature such a rent core set of PROMs include the development of a PROM mobile application web base system or email reminder for stigma further validation and additional translation of the Patients perceive these approach to PROM adminis QOLOS excess skin questionnaire Moreover the issue of cost tration a easy and user friendly Second appropriate associate with the IWQOL Lite self esteem questionnaire shall train on PROM administration and interpretation be neces be address On the contrary the BODY Q and QOLOS be avail sary for healthcare provider The use of a minimal able free of charge Possible new PROMs shall also need to be con clinically important change MCID that be the small change sidered in detail We discuss these point extensively in our previ in a treatment outcome that an individual would identify a ous article submit Future S Q O T meeting shall be necessary important could aid healthcare provider in interpret to determine how the PROMs should be use in registry If this PROM score The MCID from the IWQOL Lite total score core set be adopt and implement it could potentially promote range from to point depend on baseline severity the collection of outcome that be clinically important to patient The MCID for all quality of life domain of the BODY Q and expert alike and thus improve the quality of obesity treatment be currently be determine Determining a MCID for the globally Ideally this set of PROs and PROMs should be comple QOLOS will also be necessary mented by a set of clinical outcome that form a core outcome set The key strength of our study be that we involve a geo for obesity treatment graphically diverse panel of healthcare provider from different discipline as well a participant live with obesity most of whom be involve in patient representative network Initially Conclusion our goal be to involve healthcare provider and participant liv ing with obesity in a ratio but on account of cancellation A core set of PROs and PROMs for measure quality of life in we end up with a ratio The moderator ensure that the clinical obesity care be select by a heterogenous group of participant live with obesity could voice their opinion suffi participant live with obesity and healthcare provider The ciently There be some limitation too First due to the multiple set include subscales from the BODY Q physical function subject that need to be address and the strict time sched physical symptom psychological function social function ule prolong discussion during the meeting be not possi eat behavior and body image IWQOL Lite self esteem ble Second some expert join the meeting online which may and QOLOS excess skin questionnaires A PROM for stigma have limit their involvement during discussion Third one be not select because the available PROMs be consid healthcare provider involve in the development of the BODY

current literature to formulate practical and evidence base guidance regard the diagnosis and treatment of PBH to recommend future avenue for research in this condition Method A scoping review be undertake after an extensive literature search A consensus on the guidance and confidence in the recommendation be reach by the steer group author prior to review by key stakeholder Outcome We make pragmatic recommendation for the practical diagnosis and management of PBH include criterion for diagnosis and recognition as well a recommendation for research area that should be explore Plain English summary Post bariatric hypoglycaemia PBH be a condition that commonly affect people who have undergone weight loss surgery In this condition people develop low blood sugar occur about h after meal lead to debilitate symptom such a hunger sweat anxiety palpitation and even blackout and fainting PBH be become more common a weight loss surgery be be take up by more people to help with their weight and to help with diabetes The condition often develop after the patient have be discharge from follow up after their surgery which can lead to inconsistent diagnosis and treatment in non specialist healthcare centre The lack of clear information and evidence in the exist scientific literature far contributes to the variation in care To address this problem the Society for Endocrinology have create new guideline to help healthcare professional accurately diagnose and manage this condition The guideline be develop with input from dietitian surgeon and doctor specialise in weight loss and hormone specialist Keywords obesity bariatric surgery post bariatric hypoglycaemia late dump Introduction Bariatric surgery such a Roux en Y gastric bypass As a result it be important to identify diagnose and gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy carry adequately treat PBH in people who have undergone significant metabolic benefit include weight loss bariatric surgery diabetes remission and reduction of macrovascular and microvascular event As a result of this clinical Aims and objective evidence bariatric surgery be more often consider a an option for the treatment of obesity and diabetes The aim of this guideline be to improve and standardise as well a for other metabolic complication such clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of a non alcoholic fatty liver disease Given the PBH To this end our objective be to undertake an increase prevalence of bariatric surgery clinician be up to date review of the current literature formulate increasingly encounter complication of surgery practical and evidence base guidance regard the One such complication be post bariatric hypoglycaemia diagnosis and treatment of PBH and recommend PBH

report regard the gastric banding there be a rapid transit of nutrient to risk factor for PBH Some observational study have the jejunum and the ileum with absorption and a rapid suggest that people who develop PBH be non diabetic peak of glucose which provoke insulin secretion The pre operatively and have low pre operative HbA c This exposure of L cell in the distal jejunum and proximal

the Indeed the presence of pre operative hypoglycaemia hyperglycaemia dependent secretion of insulin and during an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT be associate the insulin dependent disposal of

insulinotropic response surgery However other study have find lead to an overswing hypoglycaemia i e PBH no association between hypoglycaemia and some of In support of this theory a GLP receptor antagonist the abovementioned risk factor such a magnitude of exendin abolishes hypoglycaemia in people with weight loss age and gender although the latter study PBH also discuss below Other possible

I can t climb I be tell of my original weight be often enough to see Yes my initial goal be which I achieve but it make no improvement In reality I have to lose a lot more than that but difference to symptom so I be tell to keep go until it work be quite easy to achieve Now no goal and no end in sight They keep move it then I didn t lose it fast enough Got tell to lose stone I be no good with massive goal like that He just look at me and say I need to lose a lot of weight Wasn t even weigh The goal I be give be not realistic a it be what I weigh year ago when I be a year old adolescent I

HCPs should avoid oversimplistic that IIH can not be cause by excess weight alone And advice of eat less move more PwIIH want HCPs to they reason that not all PwIIH have excess weight and provide

Editor Rebecca Burch MD Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Abstract Background and Objectives Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH be associate with obesity however there be a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH The aim of this systematic review be to evaluate weight loss intervention in people with IIH to determine which intervention be superior in term of weight loss reduction in intracranial pressure benefit to visual and headache outcome quality of life and mental health Methods A systematic review be carry out in accordance with PRISMA guideline and register with PROSPERO CRD MEDLINE and CINAHL be search for relevant th literature publish from inception until December Screening and quality appraisal be conduct by two independent reviewer Recommendations be grade use Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN methodology Results A total of study be include Bariatric surgery result in kg weight loss at month Level to Lifestyle weight management intervention result in between to kg weight loss Level to Bariatric surgery result in the great mean reduction in ICP cm H O at month Level follow by multi component lifestyle intervention acetazolamide cm H O at month Level and then a very low energy diet intervention cm H O at month Level The least ICP reduction be show at month after complete a month multi component lifestyle intervention cm H O Level Reduction in body weight be show to be highly correlate with reduction in ICP Level to Discussion Bariatric surgery should be consider for woman with IIH and a BMI kg m since this have the most robust evidence for sustained weight management Grade A A multi component lifestyle intervention diet physical activity behaviour have the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI kg m Grade B Longer term outcome for weight management intervention in people with IIH be require to determine if there be a superior weight loss intervention for IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH be characterize by raise intracranial pressure ICP pulse synchronous tinnitus headache and papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss Most people live with IIH be also live with obesity Population study have observe the increased incidence of IIH in those with an increase body mass index BMI and an elevated BMI be show to be directly associate with great risk of a diagnosis of IIH Furthermore a relationship between BMI and visual outcome have be establish A study find patient with BMI kg m be more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro ophthalmology visit and every kg m increase in BMI increase the odds of severe visual loss by time IIH be emerge from be a disease of the neuro ophthalmic axis to be a distinct metabolic disease where the underlying pathophysiology may be modify by weight loss Moreover IIH have be demonstrate to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promote further weight gain At the same time psychiatric disorder be sevenfold more common in people with IIH compare to the general population which may result from common biological pathway relate to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal cortex HPA axis dysfunction which may mean weight management be more challenging for people live with IIH Obesity result from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factor and there be a strong genetic component underlie interindividual variation in body weight As a result the human body be biologically hard wire to prevent weight loss This be a challenge for the treatment of IIH since excess body weight have an impact on IIH development and improvement Moderate weight gain of be associate with a great risk of develop IIH among both people with and without obesity Meanwhile weight loss in the range of have be report to lead to remission and weight re gain have be find to be a risk factor for disease recurrence Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Sustained weight loss therefore be essential for long term remission of the disease However clinical practice be vary in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategy for IIH Indeed sustain weight loss have be demonstrate to be essential for long term remission of the disease The optimal weight loss method for IIH be yet to be determine especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity Hence the aim of this study be to identify evaluate and summarise the relevant publish study relate to weight loss intervention for IIH in term of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcome such a vision and headache A second aim of the study be to convene a panel of expert in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice point to help guide clinician who may not have formal training in weight management Methods This systematic review be register on PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identifier CRD and be report in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses PRISMA guideline Search strategy th The database MEDLINE and CINAHL be search from inception up to December via EBSCO use a comprehensive search strategy eAppendix which be test and refine to maximise

systematic review and grade accord to the quality of available evidence Where evidence be not available for IIH population GPP be formulate base upon evidence extrapolate from obesity literature The graded recommendation be show in Table Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Discussion The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people live with IIH be not only because weight loss reduces ICP but also that it reduce mortality and reduce the burden of prevalent and incident obesity relate complication Weight loss be recognise a a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH This study seek to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH which be identify a research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership The panel make graded recommendation base upon the evidence identify by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in good practice point from the obesity literature Table While there be one RCT demonstrate Level evidence for the direct use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to month and one cross over study Level utilise a VLED for month which demonstrate efficacy in term of ICP visual and headache outcome these two study have not be replicate The result of this analysis therefore demonstrate the shortage of high quality evidence a there be no study that could be directly compare due to different weight management method be use and a lack of standardised outcome measure Sustained long term weight loss should be consider a a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patient with IIH Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counsel sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH They should have their weight measure and BMI calculate to assess the weight management option and monitor the intervention efficacy Although there be no RCTs that evaluate the measurement of overweight and obesity compare to not measure these outcome the panel agree that this aspect of IIH patient care be essential The degree of weight loss require for IIH symptom improvement be less clear a study report amount of weight lose with a variety of outcome measure There be no study Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology evaluate the time where the minimum amount of weight lose be correlate with the point of disease remission There be Level evidence that demonstrate a reduction of weight between be require to achieve disease remission In the VLED cross over study of body weight loss be correlate with reduction in ICP resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcome and the IIHWT disease remission be define a ICP to return to normal level at cmH It be therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle intervention deliver in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss require to induce remission of IIH The panel consider this evidence and recommend the target weight loss should be for IIH disease remission However the panel acknowledge that this goal be unlikely to be achieve via a lifestyle intervention alone and a realistic goal may be weight loss which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptom There be no study evaluate solely physical activity intervention in IIH Physical activity could be recommend a part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss Behaviour therapy have be show to be a useful adjunct when incorporate into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance Licensed anti obesity medication AOMs do not feature in this study a there be no study with primary aim of use pharmacotherapy for weight loss in IIH It be noteworthy that there be inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such a acetazolamide and topiramate and to a less extent zonisamide be use to manage IIH and have previously be clinical observe to reduce weight The method by which acetazolamide cause weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia a salty rancid or metallic taste sensation that persist in the mouth nausea dyspepsia vomiting and diarrhoea Acetazolamide be not well tolerate in this patient group with up to of people discontinue the medicine In our systematic review it be interest to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and ICP at month follow the direct use of acetazolamide Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology Bariatric surgery have the great sustained weight loss up to month Clinicians manage IIH may be reluctant to refer patient for bariatric surgery due to fund access and misconception regard the safety of bariatric surgery such a operative mortality excess skin and nutritional optic atrophy Physicians may be concern about CSF shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery however bariatric surgery have be show to be safe and more cost effective than CSF shunt Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedure be superior to gastric band in term of weight loss and ICP reduction in people with IIH For obesity gastric bypass have be find to be the most clinically effective and most cost effective intervention compare to other weight management programme and have the high quality adjust life year QALY gain Superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in IIH may be explain by the enhanced postprandial glucagon like peptide GLP secretion a emerge data find that exogenously administer GLP significantly reduce ICP without weight loss Another key consideration when understand the impact of an intervention be the natural history of the disease include disease duration This could have an impact on outcome for example in people who have have the disease for many year it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that have occur due to axonal loss and hence why in study with long disease duration the visual field measure may not improve Likewise papilloedema may acutely be present and without intervention may regress to the mean Strengths of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review which be prospectively register on PROSPERO and all screen data extraction and quality assessment be blind and conduct by two reviewer The evidence be translate into clinical recommendation which be make by multi disciplinary expert in obesity and IIH Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology hence support the translation of the research for clinical application There be certain limitation to the study The included study all use different outcome measure and a variety of weight loss method This mean a meta analysis be not able to be perform due to study heterogeneity This heterogeneity in IIH study evaluate weight loss method need to be consider when plan future clinical trial in IIH We also only include publish study which mean there be potential for publication bias As meta analysis be preclude it be not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias use funnel plot The study population of our included study be predominately female a reflection of IIH be less prevalent in male however the finding be therefore not generalisable to male Specifically there be a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in IIH in a male population and for both gender at a low BMI of kg m None of the study include woman who be pregnant which be an area in need of evaluate a it have be recommend that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input Most of the study be of short duration with only one study report outcome longitudinally at year The longer the reporting period the more missing data occur However future study should be encourage to include long term outcome to determine cost effectiveness and intervention durability People with IIH who have obesity compare to healthy weight have significantly low health related quality of life score Moreover obesity and weight gain have be find to be independent predictor of poor mental health relate quality of life Psychiatric symptom in association with IIH be usually poorly describe and underestimate in the literature but the prevalence be report to be as high a Given that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patient engagement and adherence to weight management intervention and indeed IIH treatment this require investigation Hence future study should collect quality of life and Copyright The Author s Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology psychiatric outcome measure to evaluate the influence of weight management intervention and include long term outcome data collection to assess durability of the intervention Conclusions We advocate for obesity to be view a a chronic disease with complex contributory association and prognostic implication to IIH rather than merely a risk factor Weight loss should be see a an important tool in the management of IIH The biological driver of obesity may explain why short term weight management intervention be often insufficient for long term disease remission The hierarchy of effect in weight loss method seem to be analogous to the reduction of ICP with bariatric surgery have the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the IIH population However not all patient will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention In such case multi component lifestyle intervention should be provide but it should be acknowledge that weight loss be likely to be modest and IIH disease remission be therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in IIH symptom WNL eapp http link lww com WNL D WNL eapp http link lww com WNL D WNL etab http link lww com WNL D WNL etab http link lww com WNL D WNL etab
