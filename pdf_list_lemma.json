what i hear from people live with obe participant live with obesity no prom be sity these aspect seem to be very important for qual select because none of the available prom be consider ity of life the body q eating behavior subscale suitable reason include the absence of question on general come close to measure these aspect quote from experience of stigma the inability to use the questionnaire a psychologist longitudinally and the absence of validation evidence in people undergoing obesity treatment below one healthcare provider highlight the importance of assess both internalized weight body image stigma and the effect of experience of weight stigma two third of the participant vote to include the pro body internalized weight stigma refers to the stigma direct image vote healthcare provider partici towards oneself there be a correlation between inter pant live with obesity a considerable difference be nalized weight stigma and the impact or acceptance of observe in the preference of healthcare provider and partici weight stigma it be important to not only assess inter pant live with obesity several participant live with obesity nalization but also the effect of weight stigma such a mention that they do not want the focus of body image to be it impact on healthcare engagement and mental or social on physical aesthetic they suggest that a prom assess health quote from a researcher body image should focus on the individual perception of their this healthcare provider be support by a participant own body conversely healthcare provider report that the living with obesity who also highlight the importance of prom available for assess body image should accurately capture the impact of weight stigmatize experience capture the individual feeling towards their own body they emphasize that body image change drastically after weight none of the question assess the impact of stigma loss treatment and therefore it be an important measure they only focus on the prevalence of stigma no scale be consider suitable for use in obesity treatment in my experience a a dietitian body image be a very quote from a participant living with obesity important domain because weight loss intervention have such a big effect on body image patient tell me that the perspective of their body change drastically discussion after weight loss treatment quote from a dietitian after a group discussion re vote on body image result this study describe the selection of a core set of pro and in more vote in favor of include body image vote prom for assess quality of life in clinical obesity care the healthcare providers participant live with obesity process include a systematic review and a multinational con and the body q body image subscale be select sensus meeting that be attend by people live with obesity a the most suitable prom vote healthcare provid and by healthcare provider from various discipline the pro er participant live with obesity and prom select be iwqol lite self esteem obesity surgery body q physical function physical symptom psychological the op scale be not consider suitable for measure social function social function eat behavior and body image function and the promis and owqol be not validate and qolos excess skin these prom contain good for obesity treatment we point out that the selection measurement property ensure that the measurement of qual of prom for research purpose or clinical practice may thus ity of life provide valid and reliable outcome this core set far vary significantly from those use in registry a number can be use in different cultural and geographical setting spe of healthcare provider suggest that some prom could be cifically these prom be available in and language omit from the core set and that others contain too many respectively no prom be select to measure stigma question between seven and ten per pro by omit these because the available prom be consider unsuitable to the prom feasibility might be enhance and less time would best of our knowledge this be the first multinational and multidis be need to complete the questionnaire accord to the ciplinary effort in obesity treatment to achieve the goal of stand participant live with obesity at the meeting omission be ardizing the quality of life outcome that matter most to patient not necessary they do not consider complete multiple the primary objective of the core set be to improve the quality of questionnaire a burdensome provide their purpose be care in obesity treatment by reflect outcome that be most explained and feedback be provide important to patient to this end we incorporate the extensive use prom in clinical practice be increasingly become input of people live with obesity throughout the development of routine in the treatment of cancer for example prom be the set the core set represent the selection of prom that should use to monitor symptom and quality of life during the pre minimally be use in clinical obesity care operative and postoperative period their administration the same pro and prom be select for the clinical and interpretation lead to good identification of posttreatment practice core set a for the research core set which allow the symptom and problem enhance clinical decision make same set to be use for different purpose the pro mostly process and improve communication between patient and align with the finding of coulman et al they identify healthcare provider the ability of prom to improve out eight theme with regard to live with the outcome of meta come in cancer care be far illustrate by basch et al bolic and bariatric surgery despite frequent use of the sf they report that in comparison to usual care digital symp in prior obesity treatment research it be not include in the tom monitoring use prom significantly improve physical core set a participant favor other prom base on face function symptom control and overall quality of life there be validity in a recent validation study by de vries et al even evidence that prom can improve survival in cancer care the sf be not support by sufficient validation evidence in obesity treatment prom data offer a unique oppor in patient undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery due to tunity to enrich consultation by redirect the focus to those the irrelevance of some question and lack of relevant item aspect that concern patient most or problem that would oth to patient among other reason align with the cur erwise go undetected sharing prom data facilitates active rent finding recently greene et al establish a selection patient participation in progress tracking and outcome assess of prom to be implement in the metabolic and bariatric ment thereby enhance communication between patient and surgery accreditation quality improvement program in the healthcare provider use prom in obesity usa they identify health self confidence mobility treatment enables healthcare provider to deliver care that aligns and everyday activity a the high ranking pro domain with patient need and ultimately to provide value base and and select the promis obesity relate problem scale high quality care to further aid implementation of the op scale and obesity and weight loss quality of life prom in clinical practice we develop a user manual for the instrument owqol for inclusion the s q o t consensus core set appendix table meeting take a different approach to select prom by despite the benefit of prom there be challenge regard focus on their suitability for the selected pro domain ing their implementation first the participant live with obesity surgery obesity indicate that the lack of feedback on prom score be only this be unlikely to have bias our result fourth not all what withhold them most from routinely complete prom online participant participate in the entire two day meeting we conclude that prom should only be implement in clin either a a consequence of the different time zone or because of ical practice if the score be share with the patient to facili the multiple meeting that be plan prior to the combine tate this process a digital platform be require that automatically congress of the european association on the study of obesity dispatch prom before consultation and allow the prom and the international federation for the surgery of obesity and score to be display on a dashboard for healthcare provider metabolic disorder european chapter and people live with obesity to see several electronic during future meeting we shall continue to improve the cur measurement system be propose in the literature such a rent core set of prom include the development of a prom mobile application web base system or email reminder for stigma further validation and additional translation of the patient perceive these approach to prom adminis qolos excess skin questionnaire moreover the issue of cost tration a easy and user friendly second appropriate associate with the iwqol lite self esteem questionnaire shall train on prom administration and interpretation be neces be address on the contrary the body q and qolos be avail sary for healthcare provider the use of a minimal able free of charge possible new prom shall also need to be con clinically important change mcid that be the small change sidered in detail we discuss these point extensively in our previ in a treatment outcome that an individual would identify a ous article submit future s q o t meeting shall be necessary important could aid healthcare provider in interpret to determine how the prom should be use in registry if this prom score the mcid from the iwqol lite total score core set be adopt and implement it could potentially promote range from to point depend on baseline severity the collection of outcome that be clinically important to patient the mcid for all quality of life domain of the body q and expert alike and thus improve the quality of obesity treatment be currently be determine determine a mcid for the globally ideally this set of pro and prom should be comple qolos will also be necessary mented by a set of clinical outcome that form a core outcome set the key strength of our study be that we involve a geo for obesity treatment graphically diverse panel of healthcare provider from different discipline as well a participant live with obesity most of whom be involve in patient representative network initially conclusion our goal be to involve healthcare provider and participant liv ing with obesity in a ratio but on account of cancellation a core set of pro and prom for measure quality of life in we end up with a ratio the moderator ensure that the clinical obesity care be select by a heterogenous group of participant live with obesity could voice their opinion suffi participant live with obesity and healthcare provider the ciently there be some limitation too first due to the multiple set include subscales from the body q physical function subject that need to be address and the strict time sched physical symptom psychological function social function ule prolong discussion during the meeting be not possi eat behavior and body image iwqol lite self esteem ble second some expert join the meeting online which may and qolos excess skin questionnaires a prom for stigma have limit their involvement during discussion third one be not select because the available prom be consid healthcare provider involve in the development of the body ered unsuitable the prom that be select represent q be instruct not to vote but she could participate in the outcome that matter most to patient and should serve a a discussion see that this restriction apply to one participant minimum when measure

the prevalence of a healthy weight bmi in this a useful future analysis a a recent analysis of iih study be similar to a previous large study of iih in life database find that a change in bmi be this

at baseline despite similar oct papilloe be not clear dema measure this could potentially reflect a delay although the outcome base on bmi be similar in diagnosis due to a low suspicion of iih in for

kg m this be consistent in that baseline bmi a role for dietary modification and pharmacother potentially and have a great influence on visual apy to avoid future weight gain a this have be outcomes

where such a address child overweight be if you refer them it tend to be reject our work lie sn focus group fg no longer in their role description and they pn be expect to focus on other priority although the hcps recognise they when ask about access to exist some gps felt that address child weight have a role in provide child weight information on child weight status gps be a marginal part of their role management advice they felt limited and pns discuss that they have no time because usually they come in about in what they could offer and the lack access to these data from other source

cultural belief i ve not get a handle on i think it ncmp data would be helpful for a conversation about child weight yet gp you re then not just solely rely could be defensive some hcps do not upon

hcps receive make dedicate appointment to make them more reluctant to address on childhood obesity and nutrition which discuss child excess weight there be a child overweight contribute to reluctance to initiate sense that this also give parent time to conversation about child weight prepare for the conversation i think it s quite difficult to talk about weight when they ve the family get so and i think it s a problem that lot of it discussion about child weight require people would like to tackle but they just much go on sn fg discuss more than the extra thirty second i have don t really know where to start we vignette at the end of the ten minute consultation don t have much in the way of training sometimes i will get over that by say sns particularly saw the feedback letter about

discuss that the wording this in the context of ethnic and cultural to enable hcps to access and share be problematic often cause anger and factor health information and measurement distress for child with other healthcare i think in this population the issue be that i ve have quite a few parent who be organisation and to join up work the certain minority that we have here very upset receive the

also identify useful specific skill ncmp would enable them to easily track which include skill relate to help i have one mum and her child be child s weight status and be alert to patient change behaviour motivational overweight but she be a young parent and child who be rapidly gain weight interviewing and to provide child she actually didn t know how to cook the weight management and healthy eat it s all this collaborative work isn t it dinners and yeah we spend a lot of time advice many participant felt that more it ll stop do the work twice and also with her give her worksheet how to cook training on provide this advice would it s about be on the same page as well make potato and bean rather than go to help them address child weight some because a parent may come to u and say the fish and chip shop sn fg also comment on the need to consider i don t know what the problem be and we different cultural context when provide it s kind of address it in the sense of can say well actually let s have a look at healthy eating and weight management can they do thing a a family together in what the school nurse measure pn advice term of their diet change the chapati from white flour to brown flour simple through discussion of the vignette i think what s the term motivational thing like that change the rice to brown access to interpreter for parent with interview i ve do a lot of that in rice maybe everyone go out for a walk limited english be identify a a the past i think that s useful look at together or go to the park together facilitator to have conversation about motivation to change pn gp discuss vignette child excess weight in these family i ve never really have any formal training on when ask directly about incentive we obviously want to be work with deal with obesity in child i think some but not all gps identify that the family and for them to feel that it s more practical training be need on what incentives through the quality and something beneficial not just to the you can actually offer and what be prove to outcomes framework remuneration to child but to the whole family pn work most effectively gp general practice for specify healthcare activity to proactively address childhood participant discuss signpost you need to be aware of what different excess weight could be a useful approach or provide lifestyle and weight type of food for different type of people however some hcps felt that this may management resource to family often refer to different culture sn fg result in a tick box approach highlight free online material such several pns and sn discuss the a change life a national campaign if the patient speak limited english but be value of learn skill and approach to improve family dietary intake and able to understand some of what i m say to have conversation and provide physical activity some participant i would probably address the main symptom weight management advice from peer felt that a more bespoke resource pack and then invite them to return with an contain specific weight management interpreter for the follow up appointment what i actually believe a well be share advice for family would assist them in gp discuss vignette the experience as well like you say i do opportunistically address child excess this with that one sn fg weight if you want it do gps to have conversation with parent about child i think an information package to be able discussion excess weight you have to attach to give to a parent would be great i some kind of incentive for all gps to take think from a healthcare professional point summary it seriously unfortunately but at the of view be to give them something to put same time i think there run the risk of it gps pns and sn recognise the in their hand that they will sit and look at become a tick box exercise to get that importance of have conversation when they ve get five minute pn payment gp with parent about child excess weight but they experience several barrier hcp knowledge and skills the need hcp approach hcps identify while some related to family factor for increased hcp knowledge of child several useful approach to many be structural or relate to the weight management service and the conversation with parent about hcps themselves the study be able to requirement to develop certain skill child excess weight they describe identify facilitating factor for hcps in be identify a facilitator some hcps link weight to the problem that the have these conversation which have in primary care perceive that there be child be present with and give inform the potential strategy the exist service in their local area that common sense advice relate to food author have propose see implication they could refer to but it be not always provision diet and physical activity for practice that would address both know what these be when training and skill be discuss hcp relate and structural barrier within offer people service that be some highlight that more training on primary and community care the study available to them if you know what the give this advice would far facilitate have provide valuable new insight on service be that be out there then it make them have these conversation see facilitating factor for hcps particularly the conversation a lot easy gp hcp knowledge and skill many hcps around structural aspect of health care recognise the need to involve the whole and support the development of hcps when ask about skill and train family when provide this advice knowledge and skill a previous research participant identify generic hcp have focus on facilitator relate to i would relate it to the problem that they skills that be helpful to them in hcp parent interaction present with so one of the other thing have conversation with parent that might be a factor here might be that about their child s weight include structural change that would support the child be carry more weight than they communication skill and be train to hcps in have conversation with research british journal of general practice june e rreesseeaarrcchh parent about child weight relate to hcps in have conversation with in line with the present study s finding organisational aspect within primary and parent about child weight the main barrier identify in these latter study community care for example system of primary and community care hcp include a lack of confidence in initiate dedicated appointment well access to group that be well place to address discussion inadequate time fear of weight in primary school age child undermine parental trust lack of interpreter and financial incentivisation be include participant serve recognition of overweight and cultural however the need for a more joined up socioeconomically disadvantage and perception of weight by parent approach across healthcare organisation ethnically diverse population be difficulty in and avoidance of give and school with cross agency work recruit which enable the study to nutrition advice and lack of collaborative and sharing of information and weight explore the challenge face within work with other organisation assessment data include from the these community the data collection ncmp be highlight hcps fear of damage parental trust approach include the use of vignette and relationship while common may be several approach that hcps be which be identify a a valuable method unfounded adult with obesity mostly already use be identify as good to explore in more depth the challenge welcome health professional initiate strategy when have conversation face by hcps this be further conversation about weight and parent with parent about child weight but strengthen by the involvement of a of young child be generally receptive multidisciplinary hcp group who advise participant clearly articulate where to hcps discuss child weight on the development of the discussion they need far development however the insight of this study s guide and vignette in their knowledge and skill this participant into barrier such a limited include knowledge of local child limitation include the focus on the cultural awareness and a lack of train weight management provision and english healthcare context it be not and skill in give weight management skill in weight management advice and advice have reinforce previously clear whether these finding would support behaviour change awareness identify hcp training gap the need be transferrable to the wider uk and of the cultural context and the ability to good address cultural competence international context however give to provide culturally appropriate advice and safety in gp and nurse training have the resonance of the finding with the be see a important be highlight a have the need for international literature on the barrier better skill development of medical and to hcps have these conversation nursing professional in nutrition and it be likely that there would be some strength and limitation obesity assessment and management applicability of the finding to other this study address a knowledge the development of skill and resource contexts the recruitment approach for gap relate to strategy to support to support hcps in child weight primary care professional depend management activity be a prominent on advertising so the study

so much raise your consciousness around please god more to it be it wholesome be it pure everything halal participant faith leader isn t necessarily good for you participant faith leader some food

pulse synchronous tinnitus headache and papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss most people live with iih be also live with obesity population study have observe the increased incidence of iih in those with an increase body mass index bmi and an elevated bmi be show to be directly associate with great risk of a diagnosis of iih furthermore a relationship between bmi and visual outcome have be establish a study find patient with bmi kg m be more likely to have severe papilloedema at the first neuro ophthalmology visit and every kg m increase in bmi increase the odds of severe visual loss by time iih be emerge from be a disease of the neuro ophthalmic axis to be a distinct metabolic disease where the underlying pathophysiology may be modify by weight loss moreover iih have be demonstrate to have a distinct pathophysiology that hinders weight loss and promote further weight gain at the same time psychiatric disorder be sevenfold more common in people with iih compare to the general population which may result from common biological pathway relate to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal cortex hpa axis dysfunction which may mean weight management be more challenging for people live with iih obesity result from an interaction between innate biological and environmental factor and there be a strong genetic component underlie interindividual variation in body weight a a result the human body be biologically hard wire to prevent weight loss this be a challenge for the treatment of iih since excess body weight have an impact on iih development and improvement moderate weight gain of be associate with a great risk of develop iih among both people with and without obesity meanwhile weight loss in the range of have be report to lead to remission and weight re gain have be find to be a risk factor for disease recurrence copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology sustain weight loss therefore be essential for long term remission of the disease however clinical practice be vary in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategy for iih indeed sustained weight loss have be demonstrate to be essential for long term remission of the disease the optimal weight loss method for iih be yet to be determine especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity hence the aim of this study be to identify evaluate and summarise the relevant publish study relate to weight loss intervention for iih in term of their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcome such a vision and headache a second aim of the study be to convene a panel of expert in the field of iih and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice point

consensus base recommendation for weight management in people with iih base upon the evidence identify within the systematic review and grade accord to the quality of available evidence where evidence be not available for iih population gpp be formulate base upon evidence extrapolate from obesity literature the graded recommendation be show in table copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology discussion the recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people live with iih be not only because weight loss reduces icp but also that it reduce mortality and reduce the burden of prevalent and incident obesity relate complication weight loss be recognise a a modifiable factor in the treatment of iih this study seek to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for iih which be identify a research priority by the james lind alliance priority set partnership the panel make graded recommendation base upon the evidence identify by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in good practice point from the obesity literature table while there be one rct demonstrate level evidence for the direct use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in icp to month and one cross over study level utilise a vled for month which demonstrate efficacy in term of icp visual and headache outcome these two study have not be replicate the result of this analysis therefore demonstrate the shortage of high quality evidence a there be no study that could be directly compare due to different weight management method be use and a lack of standardised outcome measure sustain long term weight loss should be consider a a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patient with iih patient with iih with overweight or obesity should be counsel sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in iih they should have their weight measure and bmi calculate to assess the weight management option and monitor the intervention efficacy although there be no rcts that evaluate the measurement of overweight and obesity compare to not measure these outcome the panel agree that this aspect of iih patient care be essential the degree of weight loss require for iih symptom improvement be less clear a study report amount of weight lose with a variety of outcome measure there be no study copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology evaluate the time where the minimum amount of weight lose be correlate with the point of disease remission there be level evidence that demonstrate a reduction of weight between be require to achieve disease remission in the vled cross over study of body weight loss be correlate with reduction in icp resolution of papilloedema and favourable headache outcome and the iihwt disease remission be define a icp to return to normal level at cmh it be therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle intervention deliver in the community setting may be effective for weight loss they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss require to induce remission of iih the panel consider this evidence and recommend the target weight loss should be for iih disease remission however the panel acknowledge that this goal be unlikely to be achieve via a lifestyle intervention alone and a realistic goal may be weight loss which may still offer some improvement in iih symptom there be no study evaluate solely physical activity intervention in iih physical activity could be recommend a part of a weight control program because it may contribute to maintenance of weight loss behaviour therapy have be show to be a useful adjunct when incorporate into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance license anti obesity medication aoms do not feature in this study a there be no study with primary aim of use pharmacotherapy for weight loss in iih it be noteworthy that there be inadvertent evidence for the beneficial effect of acetazolamide on weight reduction carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such a acetazolamide and topiramate and to a less extent zonisamide be use to manage iih and have previously be clinical observe to reduce weight the method by which acetazolamide cause weight loss could be due to the propensity to cause dysgeusia a salty rancid or metallic taste sensation that persist in the mouth nausea dyspepsia vomiting and diarrhoea acetazolamide be not well tolerate in this patient group with up to of people discontinue the medicine in our systematic review it be interest to observe the magnitude of reduction of weight and icp at month follow the direct use of acetazolamide copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology bariatric surgery have the great sustained weight loss up to month clinician manage iih may be reluctant to refer patient for bariatric surgery due to fund access and misconception regard the safety of bariatric surgery such a operative mortality excess skin and nutritional optic atrophy physician may be concern about csf shunting and subsequent bariatric surgery however bariatric surgery have be show to be safe and more cost effective than csf shunt gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgical procedure be superior to gastric band in term of weight loss and icp reduction in people with iih for obesity gastric bypass have be find to be the most clinically effective and most cost effective intervention compare to other weight management programme and have the high quality adjust life year qaly gain superiority of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy in iih may be explain by the enhanced postprandial glucagon like peptide glp secretion a emerge data find that exogenously administer glp significantly reduce icp without weight loss another key consideration when understand the impact of an intervention be the natural history of the disease include disease duration this could have an impact on outcome for example in people who have have the disease for many year it may not be possible to reverse visual loss that have occur due to axonal loss and hence why in study with long disease duration the visual field measure may not improve likewise papilloedema may acutely be present and without intervention may regress to the mean strength of the study include the methodological rigour of the systematic review which be prospectively register on prospero and all screen data extraction and quality assessment be blind and conduct by two reviewer the evidence be translate into clinical recommendation which be make by multi disciplinary expert in obesity and iih copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology hence support the translation of the research for clinical application there be certain limitation to the study the included study all use different outcome measure and a variety of weight loss method this mean a meta analysis be not able to be perform due to study heterogeneity this heterogeneity in iih study evaluate weight loss method need to be consider when plan future clinical trial in iih we also only include publish study which mean there be potential for publication bias a meta analysis be preclude it be not appropriate to quantify any potential publication bias use funnel plot the study population of our included study be predominately female a reflection of iih be less prevalent in male however the finding be therefore not generalisable to male specifically there be a need for research to examine the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in iih in a male population and for both gender at a low bmi of kg m none of the study include woman who be pregnant which be an area in need of evaluate a it have be recommend that weight management in pregnancy should receive specialist weight management input most of the study be of short duration with only one study report outcome longitudinally at year the longer the reporting period the more missing data occur however future study should be encourage to include long term outcome to determine cost effectiveness and intervention durability people with iih who have obesity compare to healthy weight have significantly low health related quality of life score moreover obesity and weight gain have be find to be independent predictor of poor mental health relate quality of life psychiatric symptom in association with iih be usually poorly describe and underestimate in the literature but the prevalence be report to be as high a give that psychiatric symptom control and can influence patient engagement and adherence to weight management intervention and indeed iih treatment this require investigation hence future study should collect quality of life and copyright the author s publish by wolters kluwer health inc on behalf of the american academy of neurology psychiatric outcome measure to evaluate the influence of weight management intervention and include long term outcome data collection to assess durability of the intervention conclusion we advocate for obesity to be view a a chronic disease with complex contributory association and prognostic implication to iih rather than merely a risk factor weight loss should be see a an important tool in the management of iih the biological driver of obesity may explain why short term weight management intervention be often insufficient for long term disease remission the hierarchy of effect in weight loss method seem to be analogous to the reduction of icp with bariatric surgery have the most robust evidence for effective treatment of obesity in the iih population however not all patient will qualify for bariatric surgery intervention in such case multi component lifestyle intervention should be provide but it should be acknowledge that weight loss be likely to be modest and iih disease remission be therefore unlikely but may still offer improvement in iih symptom wnl eapp http link lww com wnl d wnl eapp http link lww com wnl d wnl etab http link lww com wnl d wnl etab http link lww
